1000133841.txt,I mean if we can decide we're going drinking or going to a party and get high and we decide that we're going to deal with each other and we're not going to get angry then it's alright.

1000061053.txt,But I have always had this fear of being controlled by them.
1004538632.txt,"[23:00]</p> And I think that's part of why I have such knee-jerk reactions to things in my life, is because I don't really feel equipped to - I don't feel equipped with a way to handle it other than just acting on my emotions."
1000013374.txt,"So I was talking to one of the management staff and he's like you should definitely, you know, not be afraid to assert yourself on what your complaints are, and everyone just talking."

1004687722.txt,And I feel like the worse I get the more I'm kind of frantic and not in control and but the things I need are so much less able to be—people just can't get them.
1004687722.txt,"Anyway where I was going with this was that it's harder for me, I was thinking about it this morning, it's harder for me to have James feel like he's failed me than it is for him to actually fail me, or for me to deal with that."

1004488859.txt,"And it's just so unbearably upsetting to have to deal with people like that, that I just don't ever want to be one of those people."
1004488859.txt,"So, it's just a matter of sort of finding a balance I guess, between feeling like I'm not a victim constantly, because it's very easy to get super passive for me on this, because there's certain types of pain that I'm just extremely vulnerable to, and some things I can sort of ignore and keep going."

1000126022.txt,And I was feeling good at being able to feel that and allow myself to express it.
1000126022.txt,And I began to feel like I'm not sure I want you to have to deal with that now.
1000126022.txt,"And I guess what I wanted to say too, is that I think that through this year and I think through our talking that I probably feel better about myself and can accept and deal with some of the things I have in the past felt somewhat inadequate about."

1000094519.txt,But I kind of sense that you would feel that the reason why I'm pulling back now is because we've touched on subjects that I don't want to deal with or it's too painful for me to deal with and I really don't think that's the case.
1000013304.txt,a feeling came up that I didn't want to feel so I tried to ignore it even if you were not going to let me.
1000013304.txt,"I just feel like, I guess, I don't have control of myself and my relationship with Cole so as I am telling you all these little arguments and things that go on in our relationship day to day or week to week, it just suddenly feels like."
1000013304.txt,I just feel all these issues or things that we are going through I should have control of.
1000013304.txt,I might feel them for a second so obviously I am suppressing them but it doesn't feel like it.
1000013304.txt,"now I feel like when I write down all these feelings, I am like: ""I don't want to deal with Cole because I just have to sort out what the hell I am feeling before I even, you know."
1000094525.txt,</p> I won't let myself feel that.

1002131938.txt,If I get very mad with a girl over at her home I was punished for it consistently and I think maybe now I'm just completely afraid to lose control of myself sort of speak because if I want to yell and scream I won't because I don't want to have to face the consequences of that any more.
1004699961.txt,But I don't know—I guess there's a way in which our jobs are really—I feel like the work he does—he has a little more control over what he does.
1000013338.txt,"and that's what's so important for me to sit down and write this whole, the story of this whole thing up and send it to the store manager, because I was told not to, don't bother the store manager on eight."

1000133994.txt,"</p> I mean that I feel so ambivalently in myself about my parents that this is just another complication which I just, (chuckling) just can't handle, it's just too much."
1000133994.txt,"</p> And if I feel it's the true meaning, has she come to the same realizations and is she willing to deal with them?"
1004532434.txt,I more feel like – I feel more out of control.

1004532434.txt,Although (inaudible at 00:15:51) – I guess I think actually for writing the paper (inaudible) before the other things I more feel out of control in that.

1002131939.txt,"And, in fact, when I think of my childhood I think of being so worried about her because she didn't seem to be able to cope with the situation really."
1004522814.txt,"And yeah, I'm pretty angry that a lot of it could have been avoided and I could have succeeded much more."
1000013305.txt,Maybe you are frustrated because I am not playing the game the way I am supposed to or I am not focusing on the things you would like me to focus on or you cannot get control of what direction I am going in - I don't know.
1004522800.txt,"(Pause)</p> Yes I mean, usually it doesn't really bother me that much, I'm like whatever, I'll redo it, but I don't know, I just felt so, like I couldn't cope with anything going wrong."

1004798897.txt,So I do feel that that's been better and I think it's a little bit more manageable cause I'm only taking the two courses.
1000060894.txt,"I keep almost figuring or expecting, or almost committing a future to the idea that sooner or later, Matt - if he can't at least confirm reality around him, he will just accept the idea that he has to cope with it some way or another, or at least lose some of the terror of it; he will just become kind of numb to it and go on through it."

1004687784.txt,"But then I just — like, I am thinking about — like I wonder how it will kind of work out in terms of my workload for school and — and I feel like the course load is — it will be manageable, but I do feel like I'm trying to like pull in a couple of extra things just to make some money 'cause that scholarship money is gone this year."
1004687790.txt,"I don't know but I think for someone who's practicing regularly it's probably something that's very well-oiled to be able to identify these things and for someone like me it's sure between when I leave here and whenever I pick up again, I'll be very rusty at these things and so I - I don't know that I feel like I'm going to - I think at one time I did feel like it was going to be something I just had to do and then I'll be healthy or something and I'll be able to handle these things in a mindful way or a reasonable way."

1000122292.txt,"I think for the most part they just expect me to deal with whatever occurs with or transpires between me and whoever, and if I speak up and say something, it is not recognized how I'm feeling."
1000122292.txt,"</p> That is the difference between them, that you would actually recognize my feelings and try to work with it to help me understand why I felt this way, or for you to avoid making me feel that way."
1000122292.txt,"I avoid telling people how I feel because I find that, a lot of people that I have become involved with over my life time, ignore it."
1000122292.txt,I'm not angry at Beth because that is how she handles things.
1000122292.txt,"But if I'm hurt, or annoyed, she'd rather just ignore it."
1004687814.txt,"</p> I do enjoy spending time with Sydney, just it's sort of interlaced with the frustration of when he is avoiding doing tasks that would ultimately make him feel better."

1000013267.txt,Of feeling like that's so out of my control and which makes me feel very much more dependent on society than I would like to feel and I-producing the proper kind of behavior kinds of things rather than just figuring out who I am and experimenting with different kinds of lifestyles and stuff.
1000013267.txt,"</p> No I've been armored over for a good while but I just-it's just something that I know I've got to figure out how to deal with because it keeps coming up and sometimes if I'm in a weakened state as far as mood and stuff like that, it comes up even worse."
1000013267.txt,"But I cannot write to her, I just-I feel like I'm so outside of it and I don't know, it affects a whole bunch of little things too and just my ability to deal with that (inaudible) [00:51:00 ]."

1000088084.txt,She said she that she felt that there was some kind of progress in me being able to control myself or not getting so tense over little things that happen or something.

1000126009.txt,"one thing about having talked about it, like I was expressing some of the ways I felt to the m-to the guy I work with and he's a very supportive man, and it, though I really didn't accept that support like I still felt incapable, it was encouraging sort of to put me through that day so that over the weekend I be, my feelings began to build in terms of good feelings and now I feel much better able to deal with that challenge."
1000126009.txt,like today I feel like I'm much more able to deal with that.
1000126009.txt,"okay I can accept that and see that, but I guess then I need to be able to deal with it when I am not feeling as good about myself."

1000126021.txt,"I guess I shouldn't feel bad about it, you know."

1000013307.txt,I mean the reason why I haven't been able to get a handle on work is because of the way I felt physically.
1000013307.txt,"it is fear and (inaudible) running away from it because I don't want to deal with it, I'm sure."
1004522816.txt,"And you know, so I think that both of us are very good at that but with real life people sadness types of things it's really not something that (pause) he's able to handle."

1004798891.txt,So probably there are so many things that I feel I cannot get a handle on that it's just like a mess.

1000013261.txt,Which I would always let myself do and which I could always control if I needed to if I felt the situation warranted it.

1004472410.txt,"</p> Yeah, it was kind of shocking because like at the end of the day I really feel like it came down to control."
1004477232.txt,"I wonder if this feeling of being under siege, a truly unpleasant feeling she might wish to avoid, led her to arrive late."
1004477232.txt,"But I think part of its like I'm so frustrated and like, ""I just can't deal with this."
1004798887.txt,"And also because part of it, he is complaining that he is not able to save as much or whatever and I don't want him to feel resentful so I would rather just let him do his thing and with the phone bill, I don't want to have to deal with overages, I don't know whatever."
1004798887.txt,"I can't, I have my own emotional issues and issues from my own childhood that I deal with and have to work with."

1000133990.txt,And he kept on going into hysterics about how it was something I wanted to do and that I wasn't doing but he would carry on and his not being able to control himself which were any need from doing something that I wanted to do —</p> —and how he felt guilty about that.
1000133990.txt,"I really feel the whole thing is a great lack of ingenuity, an inability to cope with the changes (inaudible—1:01:04."
1000133984.txt,I've become a bit afraid when somebody tells me that I've ignored them or hurt them or something like that.
1004532424.txt,"But on the other hand, A, it's humiliating that I'm being micromanaged, even though I need it, and B, there have been accountments in the last few days - like I've lost count of the number of times where I've gotten a simulation result I don't understand, couldn't explain it, gotten frustrated, and if I were on my own, I would've thrown my hands up into despair and said, ""Well, what can you do?"

1000016536.txt,"I mean I didn't (ph) manage to get angry at her, you know, which was a good thing."
1004565025.txt,That makes me feel so embarrassed that behavior gets that far out of control and I can't handle that.
1004565025.txt,"I don't like it and so for me, if I ever feel out of control in my behavior, I just remove myself from the situation."

1004565025.txt,I know how that will make me feel and I just don't want to deal with it.
1000070466.txt,"And I get the feeling maybe the reason he is ignoring me is this is the since we are thrown together so much because we're in so many things, maybe this is the way he has of telling me, ""Leave me alone."
1004565019.txt,I felt like he was questioning my money-management skills and it just felt so awkward to me.
1000070472.txt,her words may come out of love and just worry for me - love for me and worry for me - and situations that she has heard and stuff but she doesn't like fly off the handle when she says these things; it is calmly said and she has got a lot of common sense and therefore I put a lot of stock in what she says.
1004798851.txt,"Now I've got to deal with the payments, you know, which is a major downgrade in my life."

1004472411.txt,"</p> I know but I feel like should I have not, like I feel like I tried to address an issue because if not he'll go on like pretending like everything is fine so would the right thing to have done been like ignore it and just not I mean maybe with him like this is how I should deal with it but should I not have said anything and then Christmas happens and I pretend that everything is hunky dories?"
1004472411.txt,"So Christmas will come and we'll be at the house and he'll be quite and he'll be acting funny and then I feel like its, well I could do kind of what I did last night and you seem upset or Neil told me that you're upset which creates what happened last night or I just ignore his weird signals and pretends that we're carrying on as just fine."
1004472411.txt,"And then he keeps blaming, when why we're all like upset with him, on the divorce and I'm like well maybe like mom was there and kept like, since everyone was like in the same like household in the family it felt a little better, but like the problems that I have with you like are not do to the divorce it's do to like the relationship we have and like the type of people we are and how he interacts with people."
1004472411.txt,"But and then like I feel like but because I want to help him but I can't (inaudible at 00:15:36) because is he just a jackass or is he like so sad and lonely that he can't, like he can't deal with it."
1004472411.txt,"But like clearly it annoys me so I don't have to like, well I don't want to ignore the matter but I don't know I feel like maybe it's time, like it just takes time and actually like over time it has been getting better but like I still feel, I still do both things and I'm not working there and slowly I'm starting to not be as upset about our relationship as I use to but (inaudible at 00:18:31) annoyed."
1004472411.txt,"So I feel like if I am upset like I usually just deal with it myself because if I tell him I'm upset I end up being more upset because I feel like, you know, something is wrong with me or he doesn't care or (inaudible at 00:21:23)."
1004472411.txt,But I don't and I feel like that in some aspects I do because I've been working for him forever but he's like I'm always like the one who like vocalizes it a little bit and he does not like when someone challenges him or does not listen to him and then he does mean things to like gain control and it's almost like con people into doing what he wants.
1004472411.txt,"So, yeah I just like I just don't, it's like I'm looking for this plan on how to deal with him and I don't know what to do or how to deal with it because I like what seems to make sense for me is to just not speak to him but I feel like in most situations that is not the answer to things but I feel like with him like you can't talk, you can't do anything so it's just like (inaudible at 00:44:34)."

1004798925.txt,I can't really do anything about that either but then I have to deal with the consequences of him being depressed or something if he hasn't taken his meds that day.
1004798925.txt,""" I mean, I don't wake up at the same time of day either, however (pause) I know that if I don't take my meds I will be very, very sad and also there's the birth control pill that I don't want to get my period."

1004798919.txt,I just deal with all the sad parts of him and like he gets to like do happy things with other people instead.
1004798919.txt,"It was just that he was feeling worse and so I like I sat there and forced myself to drive, you know, and tried not to think about it and like was so afraid I was going to lose control of the car even though it was like day time and stuff and like."
1004824779.txt,"04 seconds) No, I really think it's more that I'm—it's just—or we were saying, that I'm feeling this little bit extra anxiety because I like this girl and unlike other times, when I would just get anxious about it and then spiral out of control, now I know why I'm anxious and I know that it has nothing to do with the reality, you know."

1004687820.txt,"</p> I'm just afraid that they're just going to bother me more about the fact that I don't have a job, and I don't want to deal with that either."
1004687808.txt,"I'm not thrilled with nighttime driving on the highway even as a passenger, but it's not nearly as scary; like I don't have this fear that he's going to lose control over the car the same way that I have the fear that I would lose control."
1004687808.txt,I guess if you don't feel completely in control of yourself it's harder to feel in control of the vehicle you're driving.
1000056533.txt,"And you know, I felt at least in the past that a lot of times I might not really be investing my feelings just so I could avoid being hurt, in a sense, you know, kind of like a separation process all."
1000126017.txt,"But it was like, I didn't feel like I would have anything to say and I just, I couldn't deal with going over there and feeling like I'd be the first one there and have to sit there with those two guys and."
1004472420.txt,"And, you know, I'm very anxious and trying to control myself and distract myself with other things."
1004472420.txt,"I don't know if it's from the anxiety, whether it's just – everything just builds up, builds up and then it just explodes, and that's how I deal with it, and I let it all come out."
1004503150.txt,"So I know that I shouldn't feel back, but I don't know, I feel a little bad for him too."
1004503150.txt,"I think a little bit, if that's true but I definitely feel like – I've felt like at time like, ""Hm, my life at work would be so much easier if I didn't have to deal with your thing."
1004503150.txt,"But then I feel like I shouldn't feel bad to have the expectations, but then I don't know, I think his idea of what a good parent is or even like a good person is just so basic that I just end up feeling bad that I want more, expect more."
1004503150.txt,"And I know that I shouldn't feel like that because when I think about it more, I'm sure if there were more situations where none of us would work, my boss would like, she's pretty fair where she would help out if need be, or I think if it came up more she would end up saying, ""You know one of you has to give something up"" And I think if it came to that clearly I wouldn't be the one always giving something up."
1004503150.txt,So I don't know how to deal with people who don't care because I end up feeling really just annoyed and frustrated with them.
