1004564943.txt,but I was pretty embarrassed by it.
1004564943.txt,But it's hard for me to not stress out about being late because I've got to make up a lie.
1004564943.txt,"I feel like I've got more work to do than I really have and, I don't know. Just, I'm just all over the place."
1004564943.txt,Few days a week.</p> I felt bad like this morning. I'm reading the magazines in your waiting room...</p>
1004564943.txt,"There were times I'd stress out about it, then I just got to the point where I didn't care anymore so I didn't stress out about being late. But it's hard for me to not stress out about being late because I've got to make up a lie."
1000133869.txt,But because I was feeling kind of good at that point.
1000133869.txt,So imagine she feels the same way if I'm in rather a lousy mood.
1000133869.txt,Because I was feeling kind of rotten.
1000133869.txt,Was there something that I said or did that's upsetting you so?
1000133869.txt,I was scared to death.
1000133869.txt,And I just felt like hanging up. (Chuckles) You know like what's the sense of going on talking if the conversation is going to be so strained.
1000133869.txt,Was there something that I said or did that's upsetting you so? If it is let me know.
1000133869.txt,"Just really don't worry about it. But I thought to myself if my first thoughts are that I'm really going to enjoy it, well then I probably should.</p>"
1004564957.txt,"And Sunday night I was just like I still feel kind of yucky like I was tired, and dehydrated, and vaguely cranky."
1004564957.txt,So my parents e-mailed me like these are all the things that are wrong with your cousin and he's really worried about his kidneys and the enlarged heart.
1004564957.txt,"I guess in a way he feels, I think, kind of let down by our family."
1004564957.txt,but it's like I feel bad for doing well.
1004564957.txt,"And Sunday night I was just like I still feel kind of yucky like I was tired, and dehydrated, and vaguely cranky. [00:05:29]</p> It was sudden and unexpected."
1004564957.txt,"She was completely upset and freaked out and just exhausted because they'd been there since the early morning. I tried to talk to my cousin and he was like I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine."
1004564957.txt,And they're doing tests today like stress tests and everything. But it was also one of things like when I was talking to here -
1004564957.txt,So he's scared of taking insulin which is also insane. I'm like
1004564957.txt,And she says she feels really guilty about having that fight.</p> I'm like
1004564957.txt,My dad felt the same way. He's like I understand that you're sorry
1004564957.txt,So I also talk about my life and what's going on and sometimes he sounds kind of - I think it's kind of - it sounds like it makes him feel kind of bad because I'm going to get a masters and he didn't really finish high school. We've had this sort of conversation about is he smart or we talk about regrets about the past.
1004564957.txt,It's not survivor's guilt but it's like I feel bad for doing well.
1004564957.txt,"but it's like I feel bad for doing well. And the other thing I feel bad about is I think that in a way, yeah, I think his mom would be kind of disappointed."
1004564957.txt,"And the other thing I feel bad about is I think that in a way, yeah, I think his mom would be kind of disappointed. I know my grandmother would've been totally disappointed."
1000133841.txt,And I felt like I really dealt with it very well
1000133841.txt,"And I'm really glad that beforehand I had decided what I was going to do because what I began to recognize is that I guess I felt like it would have been a really serious kind of thing in terms of Claire, Gary's wife, because he was talking - and I recognized this before - Gary leads like an almost entirely different life than his wife."
1000133841.txt,But also I feel as though the decision that I shouldn't spend an evening or a day or sleep with him whatever - the decision not to do that was a pretty adult one and one that I was dealing with my responsibilities and the priorities and stuff.
1000133841.txt,And all he could say was something about being worried or couldn't I call.
1000133841.txt,It was just though I was shouting because I was angry and I was letting the anger out and I was picking - the thing that makes me feel like I was in some control is that I think I was being very careful about what I said and how I said it.
1000133841.txt,But I was angry and I was letting him know it.
1000133841.txt,And just feel like - maybe much of it is because I'm leaving in two weeks
1000133841.txt,"Part of expressing why I'm angry or how it is to deal with the anger and sometimes it's out of trying to deal out whether it's really something I ought to be angry about, if I ought to - if it's something worth bringing up and creating anything out of."
1000133841.txt,The only reason he had to be angry is that I didn't call and let him know I'd be late.
1000133841.txt,"Yeah, I don't really want to - and I feel as though like maybe in a couple of weeks I can share what happened and he'll be able to deal with it in an acceptable way."
1000133841.txt,"But I thought, I'm not going to respond that way because he hasn't - I don't understand exactly why he's so upset."
1000133841.txt,"On the other hand, I didn't feel it was that -</p>"
1000133841.txt,I felt good and comfortable and I didn't feel like I had to be guilty.
1000133841.txt,"The thing about going camping, I feel like having gotten out some things yesterday like my having gotten out and saying, ""I'm going and I'm not feeling guilty because I've planned this."
1000133841.txt,And he felt much better that I - he was really vehement about leaving
1000133841.txt,I don't know if we'll get a chance to but I'm really anxious to do that.
1000133841.txt,"and I said, ""I don't feel as though I can. Don isn't going to be taking off at all."
1000133841.txt,"And I'm really glad that beforehand I had decided what I was going to do because what I began to recognize is that I guess I felt like it would have been a really serious kind of thing in terms of Claire, Gary's wife, because he was talking - and I recognized this before - Gary leads like an almost entirely different life than his wife. His wife's perfectly satisfied being a wife and mother and revolving her world around that."
1000133841.txt,Maybe that's - out of his joking manner about a lot of things and I've taken it a lot lighter recognizing the way I feel and accepting it and feeling good about it. But also I feel as though the decision that I shouldn't spend an evening or a day or sleep with him whatever - the decision not to do that was a pretty adult one and one that I was dealing with my responsibilities and the priorities and stuff.
1000133841.txt,I really felt kind of bad that he felt so uncomfortable with that or so disappointed in it. And I guess I tried to explain it out of saying that I began to look at what was going on and - it wasn't helpful but it helped me - I just began to recognize that Don is really a priority for me.
1000133841.txt,And I felt really good about that being honest. I often sort of twist things so that they're honest but not complete.
1000133841.txt,"And all he could say was something about being worried or couldn't I call. And he didn't even allow me an opportunity to say anything to be defensive and explain or to say, ""Wait a minute."
1000133841.txt,I felt pretty good about it all. And it was like coming home and having made a decision that meant something for the two of us
1000133841.txt,"Almost, Scott, except that I - because I felt -</p> Well in a way he did except that I really felt in control of myself."
1000133841.txt,Well in a way he did except that I really felt in control of myself. It was just though I was shouting because I was angry and I was letting the anger out and I was picking - the thing that makes me feel like I was in some control is that I think I was being very careful about what I said and how I said it.
1000133841.txt,It was just though I was shouting because I was angry and I was letting the anger out and I was picking - the thing that makes me feel like I was in some control is that I think I was being very careful about what I said and how I said it. But I was angry and I was letting him know it.
1000133841.txt,But I was angry and I was letting him know it. It was sort of I guess a build up of tension and all kinds of things.
1000133841.txt,And just feel like - maybe much of it is because I'm leaving in two weeks and I'll be gone.
1000133841.txt,I mean my - I know I have a lot of dependencies too but the independent things I feel pretty strong about it. And I guess just this week they sort of really - it's being thrown out that -</p>
1000133841.txt,I'm concerned that he didn't get himself totally blitzed drunk because he wouldn't feel very good anyway. And we don't mix when either of us has been drinking a lot.
1000094426.txt,so I never had the opportunity to sit down and cry.
1000094426.txt,I was feeling like I should be there.
1000094426.txt,And I don't think it's bad to feel that I should be there.
1000094426.txt,"So I don't feel bad for not being able to say goodbye because they were never-for a long time, they were not in my same city."
1000094426.txt,And that's how I feel.
1000094426.txt,"I call them and it's like, ""I have this problem"" or ""I'm feeling like this."""
1000094426.txt,"Yeah, so I think I feel bad and not being able."
1000094426.txt,And then I was really sad.
1000094426.txt,"No, like I'm - I'm afraid that it can happen."
1000094426.txt,"And you know, like sometimes I try to - I feel helpful and feel like I'm doing something good for her to-that it's not..."
1000094426.txt,"Then I think it was happen-I got here, one and a half year, feeling lonely, being away."
1000094426.txt,I'm-I feel happy to have it. And the university one is really good.
1000094426.txt,Don't worry. I know you're not going to die because of the flu.</p>
1000094426.txt,So you feel bad because she's suffering. Then I was not in Portugal and my mom was there by her-with my father.
1000094426.txt,"Guilty, because you're not there. And they understand that I'm here."
1000094426.txt,But then you feel guilty that you cannot go back. And I would be-I would love to have the money.
1000094426.txt,So I feel guilty and I know I shouldn't feel guilty. That's the same thing my brain-
1000094426.txt,I was feeling like I should be there. I shouldn't be here.
1000094426.txt,I knew they were going to get a little worried about me. But it was the only people I could just call and tell them.
1000094426.txt,"Yeah, so I think I feel bad and not being able. Not only to be there, but also you want to support them, too?"
1000094426.txt,"So I felt mad at her for a couple of-what, a day or something. And then I was really sad."
1000094426.txt,She was really depressed. Now she's going-I told you she's going to this psychiatrist.
1000094426.txt,"And sometimes she needs someone that tells her that she can - that she needs to calm down. So I get really serious and I'm like, ""You have to-you have to."""
1000094426.txt,"It's my emotions. I always get-it's hard, it's hard."
1000094426.txt,"And you know, like sometimes I try to - I feel helpful and feel like I'm doing something good for her to-that it's not... Sometimes it's hard, like to make -  like your parents are always helping and helping you."
1000094426.txt,"And she's like, ""Don't worry, don't worry. If you are going to get into school, I'll..."" </p>"
1000094426.txt,"Yeah, and then, then again, it's like you're brain is fighting with your emotions because it's like-at the beginning, happened - - I got here, and I met a lot of people. The first three weeks, I kind of didn't realize I was here."
1000094426.txt,"People say if you walk down the street, you'll never make it to the other end. I don't think anyone here in the United States can imagine how bad it is."
1004538594.txt,"Like it wasn't even a case of I know I should go, but I'm feeling miserable, and I don't want to get out of bed.</p>"
1004538594.txt,"And I mean I had a lot going on this week.</p> I've been feeling pretty miserable, but (sigh) ...</p>"
1004538594.txt,"So, I was feeling increasingly upset with myself for not getting that done by deadline, and, you know, reverted to a bunch of patterns of, you know, avoidance and fuck it, I've been miserable all day, I deserve to like kick back and have a glass of wine and watch a TV show with my husband, but I deal with school."
1004538594.txt,"I felt guilty because the - the walk-thru that had an earlier deadline still wasn't done, so I stayed home and tried to work on that and got distracted by other things, and ..."
1004538594.txt,"I'm like these are sorts of things friends say to each other like when you're frustrated and so, -</p> - like if you're hanging out with a friend and something someone says frustrates you, you might comment about it, and Brenda's roommate just jumped all over me."
1004538594.txt,"Like there's - like I feel like the - for both male identified and female identified people, there's a whole range of -</p> - how you can present yourself that..."
1004538594.txt,"but I don't feel comfortable picking my own exciting clothes, so that's why I really want to find fashion magazines or blogs or whatever where I can say okay, this is what people who I think look cool are wearing."
1004538594.txt,"And I'm trying really hard not to be upset at my size because well, that way of life's made ys, but it's also not very healthy, but I don't know."
1004538594.txt,"Like it wasn't even a case of I know I should go, but I'm feeling miserable, and I don't want to get out of bed.</p> It was just like it wasn't even ...</p>"
1004538594.txt,"So, I was feeling increasingly upset with myself for not getting that done by deadline, and, you know, reverted to a bunch of patterns of, you know, avoidance and fuck it, I've been miserable all day, I deserve to like kick back and have a glass of wine and watch a TV show with my husband, but I deal with school. And his brother has been visiting us since he went down to Philly Friday night, came back with his brother Sunday, and his brother is staying with us."
1004538594.txt,"Another friend of Brenda's talked down to me like I was a 12-year-old, like explaining that, you know, not every blogger's fashion suits every reader. I mean there are like 400 people who post outfit photos to the Fashion Community, and of those, I may - maybe five are my personal style or maybe you just need to look a little harder, and, you know."
1004538594.txt,I don't appreciate being talked down to. Like I don't know what was going on.
1004538594.txt,"I'm like these are sorts of things friends say to each other like when you're frustrated and so, -</p> - like if you're hanging out with a friend and something someone says frustrates you, you might comment about it, and Brenda's roommate just jumped all over me. She was like, ""Well, you were being really reductionist and rude."
1004538594.txt,"I was getting increasingly more upset. And at several points in the conversation, I completed Brenda personally with the movement in general and how it's so very extraordinarily straight, feminine centric, and Jesus Christ, it's so irritating."
1004538594.txt,"Then I felt guilty all day Sunday because Saturday I spent the day with Tom instead of getting work done on either the wedding invitations or the walk-thru. And yeah, it's just been at this point a whole week of browbeating myself for the things I should've done already but haven't gotten done yet.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Right.</p>"
1004538594.txt,"And Vivienne was saying in a chat room that a number of us frequent semi-regularly that she was really frustrated that, you know, those undergrads said they could do it and they couldn't, and she really wanted hand printed invitations, but they were going to have to find a professional printer. And I was like - actually, just yesterday in fact, my advisor said that she was done with me, so - [00:20:43]</p> - so I can take this on."
1004538594.txt,"But like ... I feel like A, I would expect Ann at least who has met me several times and knows me like I'd expect her to know that I know there's more than just like the simple binary between fem and butch. And also, like I was trying to ask a question quickly in a Q and A session where, you know, each question was given 20 seconds -</p> - and it's like you don't have time to go into a long discourse about, you know, all of the different variations and interplaying, you know.</p> Right.</p>"
1004538594.txt,"And I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it, but I do want to take more care in how I dress and how I present myself, and that's - I don't know. I was always teased for my clothing when I was a child because, you know, my parents bought me cheap clothes that they thought looked good, but..."
1004538594.txt,"[00:34:28]</p> And so, like I have a great deal of fear of committing a fashion faux pas, which is why most of my clothes are fairly plain like -</p> - like solid color turtlenecks, solid color button-up shirts, plain jeans. And that - that's boring."
1004538594.txt,"And I'm trying really hard not to be upset at my size because well, that way of life's made ys, but it's also not very healthy, but I don't know. There's a big part of me that wishes I could just be skinny because then there - all of these styles that look like crap on me because I'm big, and if I was skinny and had smaller boobs, that would just be fine and ..."
1004687686.txt,"But even when I knew about it, I didn't say anything to people, which I was guilty of that for years and years and years."
1004687686.txt,And I haven't been uncontrollably upset in the last couple of days.
1004687686.txt,"I don't feel myself becoming any less upset or angry or despairing, it's just that (pause)...</p>"
1004687686.txt,I feel like even those things I'm not going to be able — I can't do if I pay attention to the part of me that's really sad (crying).
1004687686.txt,"But now that she's here, I want to take care of her more than ever.</p> With James, I spend time with James actually being sad, which I don't really with anybody else.</p>"
1004687686.txt,"I know how you feel Violet.""</p> ""If she's fussy, let her be fussy."""
1004687686.txt,"But even when I knew about it, I didn't say anything to people, which I was guilty of that for years and years and years. It's taken me a long time to realize I could not have saved her."
1004687686.txt,I feel like — it just makes me feel ugly. I'm not that happy with myself today.
1004687686.txt,"And I haven't been uncontrollably upset in the last couple of days. I've kind of kept it together, but I'm probably going to pay for it tomorrow."
1004687686.txt,It stresses me out too much. I just can't deal with it.
1004687686.txt,"(pause)</p> I don't feel that much.</p> It's more — it's just, ""Let's add 50 more insolvable problems on to the things that I feel responsible for."
1004687686.txt,"I mean I feel like has hijacked my life.</p> (pause) And that I (pause) you know, I'm working pretty hard."
1004687692.txt,Now I'm feeling (inaudible at 00:29:04)</p>
1004687692.txt,I am a little anxious about being gone next week.
1004687692.txt,Yeah I feel like when I have been doing pretty well for 24 hours or so I - like then I feel my sessions don't go as well.</p> I don't know quite why. The current theory is that when I'm having a good day I don't want to think about the things that make me not have a good day.
1004687692.txt,"When I feel like he's calling that into question, I get really pissed off. And partly because it's such a dramatic reversal of the ways that he typically values me."
1004687692.txt,"And it's told in diary forms and it follows him going from this barely literate, barely functioning adult to this amazingly intelligent man and back down again. And it was a really good book for me to read when I did it"
1004687692.txt,I mean not big that I particularly mind being poor but because - I don't know - when I was 22 it didn't occur to me that I would come down with two life threatening medical conditions for years (laughter) and have... It didn't occur to me that I might be committing myself to a career path where I have to wait ten years to have a kid and maybe not even then.
1004687692.txt,but I feel as though the more openly optimistic I am about something the more crushing it becomes when it doesn't work. Maybe this is the other side of optimism.
1004687692.txt,I feel like different people. I can't remember what it is...
1004687692.txt,I am a little anxious about being gone next week. I don't know that that would make me warier of being low here today.</p>
1004687692.txt,I felt better. Afterwards I was like wow that never happens.
1004798759.txt,"So it was after I had left work, I was kind of leaving work, frustrated about something, and then when I was walking down the steps, I just wanted to sit down and not like..."
1004798759.txt,"And it wasn't like not going to therapy, it was just like, I just want to sit down and not do anything?"
1004798759.txt,"It feels kind of weird to me that (clears throat, pause) it doesn't feel like necessarily anything happening that's extremely difficult."
1004798759.txt,I was so surprised when I felt that in the morning.
1004798759.txt,"But also, just, other times, I kind of just want to sit down somewhere and not..."
1004798759.txt,"Like other times I feel that way, it's very much like, you know, I don't want to leave the house because leaving the house means I have to walk to the bus stop and go to work and do these things, and then come back from work and do these other things."
1004798759.txt,"And also just this moment of, if I just sit down, and don't go, like physically move, then I don't have to worry about it."
1004798759.txt,"What I want to do, I guess, is just sit down, not go, and just have everything get done, and have it not be a problem.</p> Yeah.</p>"
1004798759.txt,"It just seemed like even though none of these things are difficult, and each individual thing is fine, it just feels like there's just too many things to do and not enough time, and I don't feel like (pause)"
1004798759.txt,"But this is like, I wasn't getting upset, I wasn't upset about coming here, getting my new chair, I get it from friends who I can go and talk to, so like I get to go on the bus, pick it up and go home, and then there's..."
1004798759.txt,"Or at least just (sighs)...</p> (shifts) I feel like I'm battling to get out this feeling, usually, actually now, like I find myself, like my eyes are red and I start tearing up."
1004798759.txt,"And usually when I do, I'm super upset about something."
1004798759.txt,"I'm like, okay, I'm crying, which means... it should mean that I'm really upset about something, but I don't, I don't know what the thing is.</p> (shifts) (sniffles)"
1004798759.txt,"It's partially that, and also like, I guess I'm scared that if I stop and take care of myself that I won't be able to (pause)"
1004798759.txt,"I was surprised at how intensely angry she was, though."
1004798759.txt,I don't want to be one passive-aggressive coworker away from a crying bathroom or just being really upset.
1004798759.txt,"I guess it's kind of like, I can't be really upset because there's all these things that I have to do, so (pause)"
1004798759.txt,I feel like I won't be able to feel ultimately responsible at the end of the week.
1004798759.txt,"So it was after I had left work, I was kind of leaving work, frustrated about something, and then when I was walking down the steps, I just wanted to sit down and not like... And it wasn't like not going to therapy, it was just like, I just want to sit down and not do anything?"
1004798759.txt,"It feels kind of weird to me that (clears throat, pause) it doesn't feel like necessarily anything happening that's extremely difficult. Like—I guess it's not like it's a new stressful situation."
1004798759.txt,"I was so surprised when I felt that in the morning. But also, just, other times, I kind of just want to sit down somewhere and not..."
1004798759.txt,"But also, just, other times, I kind of just want to sit down somewhere and not... I think I just have to deal with just things that I have to do.</p> Um."
1004798759.txt,"I mean, there are other areas that aren't mine that are doing it, but yeah, they're doing it up and down my side. I get to deal with it."
1004798759.txt,"What I want to do, I guess, is just sit down, not go, and just have everything get done, and have it not be a problem.</p> Yeah.</p> And it's also kind of despairing, you know what I mean?"

1000016545.txt,"And it's really kind of - it was really kind of funny because I was real tired, then I felt it rushing away, you know."
1000016545.txt,The things I remember most was the feeling I had when the guy didn't thank me.
1000016545.txt,"But the reason I felt uneasy I don't think was so much because of, you know, the fact that there were questions, I felt uneasy because I didn't know the answers.</p>"
1000016545.txt,"But yesterday afternoon, I sat down and I typed, you know, all the things I could recall in any way came across my brain."
1000016545.txt,"I can't understand...</p> Huh?</p> Not liar, but I was feeling something before about - about that"
1000016545.txt,"So I was really groggy, but I wrote it all down. And it's really kind of - it was really kind of funny because I was real tired, then I felt it rushing away, you know."
1000016545.txt,"And it's really kind of - it was really kind of funny because I was real tired, then I felt it rushing away, you know. And, you know, I was trying to catch it"
1000016545.txt,"And I didn't have any idea and I felt like an idiot. And so I asked this guy, how old is the kid?"
1000016545.txt,And the stairway - I looked straight down and there were two people down there. And there was a woman.
1000016545.txt,"There were little segments that, you know, I can't pin down as to why I don't think it was my ma. Things were all around this woman."
1000016545.txt,"But the reason I felt uneasy I don't think was so much because of, you know, the fact that there were questions, I felt uneasy because I didn't know the answers.</p> And so I had to keep asking this other guy, you know, ""How old is the kid, and what's the matter with him?"""
1000016545.txt,"Well, no, I finally - you know, I - the feeling I had was that, you know - I can't remember. After the second question, ""What's wrong with the kid,"""
1000016545.txt,"You know, don't let me off that in case I want to get off because I got a feeling I want to get off that.</p> But yesterday afternoon, I sat down and I typed, you know, all the things I could recall in any way came across my brain."
1000016545.txt,"Then it makes me feel bad just to...</p> Well, she's my mother first of all.</p> I don't know."
1000017883.txt,"I can't really explain, like whether it was a feeling or whether it was ..."
1000017883.txt,"But it's like, I can still feel it a little bit"
1000017883.txt,"Until like my girlfriend came out with, ""Oh, I've known him for a long time, he's tried that baloney with me,"" and it just ... just a little twang there and I could still feel like I was second even on this, you know?"
1000017883.txt,"And I kind of felt like ... this is why when I saw her, I kind of realized that I was like this myself."
1000017883.txt,"you know, it was almost like she felt like she had to pay me back, and I said, ""The hell with that."""
1000017883.txt,"Yeah, because all these things were hitting, but what I realized, when I came home, there wasn't anything near like I was afraid to say, ""hi,"" to her, and there was even a fellow there who I'd known before who I thought was kind of sharp and who used to go with one of my other girlfriends."
1000017883.txt,and went and got myself a drink and sat down.
1000017883.txt,"you know, I could feel that before it was like ..."
1000017883.txt,"I guess maybe mostly it was just excuses, like, ""Well I can't get along with this girl, I'm afraid of this, I'm afraid of that, and I'm afraid of the other."
1000017883.txt,"I'll pick at little things and they probably won't be the real reason for why I'm feeling the way I am, but at least now I know that when I get like that, I've got to get out."
1000017883.txt,"and I feel like it's not just going maybe this far, but going lots further and not being ... see my big thing was not that I don't think it was even so much not being able to communicate, even love, but it was almost like a fear of it."
1000017883.txt,"Yeah, and it was like, I felt this, like I was ..."
1000017883.txt,"It was like I was so afraid of rejection that it was just like rather than be rejected, I would take any kind of bull that anybody threw out."
1000017883.txt,"Yeah, I'm angry at myself and ...</p>"
1000017883.txt,"I'm angry at myself in the fact that I put up with it because it lowers my self-esteem, my respect for myself, but it's not only that."
1000017883.txt,"And it's like, when I see that, then Robin is so smart, she's another one that's like in that type of a situation that's really sad and I can kind of feel for her because she's so darn smart and so darn sensitive and then Wendy is so darn selfish, and I didn't realize this before, but this is probably why she says things like, ""Oh my mommy doesn't love me"""
1000017883.txt,I didn't realize how scared I was.
1000017883.txt,"Or part of it too was like, how do I say it so that he doesn't feel like it's HIM that I quit for?"
1000017883.txt,"And I like the discipline that my other teacher had, like he'd go (clapping sound) and everybody was down and watching."
1000017883.txt,"But it's just like, it's a nice feeling to know that I can have my own friends and I don't have to fall back on her friends and sort of be like the extra, and that's the way I've always felt with her, you know, like, ""You're here because you're my roommate and it's a nice thing to be ... to do or whatever to help you out because you're such a poor little kitten, you can't get any of your own friends so like, here's some of mine."""
1000017883.txt,"I can't really explain, like whether it was a feeling or whether it was ... like what it was, but I didn't realize how hung up I was being there even."
1000017883.txt,"I guess everything just followed (ph) through, you know, you feel like as a little kid ... because I was raised on the type that you do something wrong, you get punished, that type of thing. And it's usually ..."
1000017883.txt,"Jesus, I went out there all the time and I never felt anything and like the last time ... and it almost didn't sound like ME, it's weird, like sometimes you have something rehearsed, ""Now this sounds good"
1000017883.txt,"I could really start to feel with her, or for her, or whatever, and not just like ... I don't know, the way I used to be was just ..."
1000017883.txt,"I remember a couple of weeks ago, I felt like running. It was the weirdest thing."
1000017883.txt,"Not running away, but just running, because I felt free. I don't know what I had gone through, whether it was in therapy or I had been thinking about something at home, but it just ..."
1000017883.txt,"And I just felt so free. It's just like ...""Aah, I want to run and feel good!"""
1000017883.txt,"Yeah, because all these things were hitting, but what I realized, when I came home, there wasn't anything near like I was afraid to say, ""hi,"" to her, and there was even a fellow there who I'd known before who I thought was kind of sharp and who used to go with one of my other girlfriends. And like when I walked in, it was like ..."
1000017883.txt,and went and got myself a drink and sat down. And there was no problem.
1000017883.txt,"you know, I could feel that before it was like ... I guess maybe mostly it was just excuses, like, ""Well I can't get along with this girl, I'm afraid of this, I'm afraid of that, and I'm afraid of the other."
1004824681.txt,"One thing that I've kind of noticed this week is that I feel kind of disconnected from—normally I would think of it as kind of feeling not in my body, except I'm very conscious of my body and things."
1004824681.txt,I feel disconnected from how I'm feeling.
1004824681.txt,"When we've been talking it sort of feels like, not like I'm talking about someone else, but that there's a filter or a foggy window or something."
1004824681.txt,I woke up this morning feeling very much like I wasn't sure if that all happened.
1004824681.txt,About what I'm feeling?
1004824681.txt,"I felt like pretty much into her and the conversation we were having, but still felt a little distracted."
1004824681.txt,"I always like seeing her, but this time I was also feeling like I wanted to go home and take a nap."
1004824681.txt,Also there's something about people casually eating on the floor that's just—I just felt like it was so very unsanitary.</p>
1004824681.txt,"I always feel I don't want to be judgmental, but I am a little bit."
1004824681.txt,"It's not helpful, and I feel like they're telling me that I'm a crazy person."
1004824681.txt,"and also my position I have with my friend, Zoe, where—I don't know what I called her about, but it was something I was upset about."
1004824681.txt,Also I was really upset and she didn't seem to be taking that seriously.
1004824681.txt,"[00:39:47]</p> I also feel like in political arguments, usually the person playing devil's advocate is in the position of power and they're trying to be like, ""Well, but the devil's advocate position—what if it's just awesome to most people or what if you just don't get rights or what if . . ."
1004824681.txt,"One thing that I've kind of noticed this week is that I feel kind of disconnected from—normally I would think of it as kind of feeling not in my body, except I'm very conscious of my body and things. I feel disconnected from how I'm feeling."
1004824681.txt,"I feel disconnected from how I'm feeling. When we've been talking it sort of feels like, not like I'm talking about someone else, but that there's a filter or a foggy window or something."
1004824681.txt,"When we've been talking it sort of feels like, not like I'm talking about someone else, but that there's a filter or a foggy window or something. [00:01:13] I thought it would go away but it hasn't and it was very frustrating."
1004824681.txt,"I mean, no one likes needles, I don't like getting shots, but I had no emotion about it. I was just like, ""Oh, I didn't expect that."""
1004824681.txt,"Again, I just don't feel urgency or immediacy. I'm like, ""Ehh."
1004824681.txt,"I thought just because that was the only time I worked that hadn't stressed me out yet. I kind of realized that there are only two busses I can get home on, blah, blah, blah."
1004824681.txt,"The last half-hour of the visit I was just thinking and counting down wondering if she'd actually give me a ride so I could just get home and do whatever for a little bit. I was tired and I did take a 45-minute nap, but I didn't feel sleepy."
1004824681.txt,"I more just felt like I wanted to lie down for a little while, if that makes sense. [00:11:42] It wasn't like I wanted to fall asleep, it was that I wanted to not be doing anything."
1004824681.txt,"but I also felt a little like I couldn't even joke a little bit, like I was over talking about it even though we were busily mocking it. The reason why it was so terrible is that it is something relatively new to the area, someone who Paige who has been looking and talking to grants groups to teach classes about STDs."
1004824681.txt,"I just felt pretty sure you'd be a nurse or some other person like that, in which case you probably wouldn't be out of a job right now. Also what is your medical background?"
1004824681.txt,"The class was such a shit show and I just had this sort of feeling of, ""I really hope everyone else in this room already knows something about STDs because, Jesus Christ."" Also she was giving this little STD pack to take home which had three condoms, as always, and a pamphlet from the government about BSM and safer sex."
1004824681.txt,"Part of me didn't feel mad as much as resigned. I'm like, ""Well, he's a sucky manager."
1004824681.txt,"(pause) Because I have a lot of feelings about the topic. Theoretically, I don't think the idea of [harmoduction] (ph) when it comes to STDs is really interesting and amazing, </p>"
1004824681.txt,"I always feel I don't want to be judgmental, but I am a little bit. I am glad they're having unprotected oral sex than unprotected anal sex."
1004824681.txt,I feel like I don't know why you did that. I don't think it's interesting.
1004824681.txt,"It's not helpful, and I feel like they're telling me that I'm a crazy person. I've been thinking about it, in part, because of everyone talking about politics a lot"
1004824681.txt,"and also my position I have with my friend, Zoe, where—I don't know what I called her about, but it was something I was upset about. She actually said she was going to take the devil's advocate position and I was like, ""What?"""
1000017868.txt,"I mean in the higher - being really upset I might say something like, ""Jesus, I wish I was dead."""
1000017868.txt,"You know, like to me, that's not the way to celebrate a birthday, so I felt a little bit bad about that, you know."
1000017868.txt,"Whoever was there, you know, ""Sorry, you've got it, you've had it, sit down, I want to talk."""
1000017868.txt,"Like I would sit down and, boy, if I could sneak a novel or something behind a regular school book I'd do it and I'd be in there reading"
1000017868.txt,"And I said, ""I didn't realize I was that nervous."
1000017868.txt,But I just feel as if like it's because of something I haven't done or something I lack that people just don't like me.</p>
1000017868.txt,"Yeah, right, right, or I feel like now my dowdy little personality is completely malnutritions (ph) or whatever you want to call it."
1000017868.txt,It's like - and I shouldn't be scared.
1000017868.txt,"But I must have really had like a conflict about that for a long time, because it couldn't just be like in the last two years that I really felt stupid, because I don't know why I would."
1000017868.txt,"Like I really feel - I should feel ignorant, because I am in lots of ways, this is fine, but I don't feel ignorant, I feel stupid, and that I don't like."
1000017868.txt,"1:03:42.1</p> (Crying) Really was never afraid of me, either."
1000017868.txt,"Maybe that's why I feel like no one can love me or like me for me, because I feel like I must have done something, you know."
1000017868.txt,"and I guess that's why I never really - you know, I felt her because she was gone, but I felt like something like with my grandpa; that like she couldn't help it, she couldn't be there."
1000017868.txt,"I guess this is why, with fellows, I was so jealous, too, because like if they'd be flirting with another girl it would be like say like, well, whatever it is in you that you're lacking with it, I owe (ph) like, or whatever this girl's got and you don't have it, and I guess that's why I felt so jealous."
1000017868.txt,"Because like, you know, I felt like there's something there that just keeps people from me."
1000017868.txt,"or, you know, like there's lots of people that are just nice, and you know, like I feel like that I must not even be nice because nobody wants me."
1000017868.txt,"Yes, I think that's what really was down the basic of it, because like that's what really - I felt like my mother."
1000017868.txt,"And like I felt like - like with my grandpa; I couldn't even go to him, and I felt like I should be there, you know."
1000017868.txt,"I knew he did, I could just feel it, and they wouldn't let me see him and say goodbye to him."
1000017868.txt,"And then like I felt kind of drawn to her, because she was kind of like my mother, Mrs. Foley, but I don't know what happened."
1000017868.txt,"It's just like pushed down; I just didn't want to think about it, because he was gone.</p>"
1000017868.txt,And I always felt like he was - I guess I felt like he was there.
1000017868.txt,"I don't know, I feel like it was."
1000017868.txt,And it's like I'm really afraid.
1000017868.txt,"I'm afraid to let go.</p> See, but that's it."
1000017868.txt,I had to sit myself down for about three days before and prepare myself.
1000017868.txt,"It's just like, see, I feel maybe because I felt like I never had anything at all."
1000017868.txt,"But see, I'm always afraid that they're not going to do it, because like I've done that before."
1000017868.txt,"I mean in the higher - being really upset I might say something like, ""Jesus, I wish I was dead."" So then 'm very coldly sitting on the toilet and saying to myself, ""Well, if in six months I don't find out what the hell is wrong with me, you know..."
1000017868.txt,"And I felt like I kind of cheated her for at least a little while, but she got real emotional and she almost started crying after I was bawling all over the place. The other one was almost crying."
1000061054.txt,"So, I wasn't worried about it too much.</p>"
1000061054.txt,I just kind of feel bad because she's there with my father and he's virtually impossible to live with.
1000061054.txt,I feel bad she has to do it because she is the martyr type.</p>
1000061054.txt,I'm afraid of hurting her.</p>
1000061054.txt,"Well, I don't-no I don't-I don't really-well I feel like Robert, Adrian and I are family"
1000061054.txt,"but I don't feel like I'm his wife, you know, or I'm married to him."
1000061054.txt,"I think I'm really afraid to get married.</p> Because like, you know, I've-I haven't seen a marriage that's really lasted twenty years that's really happy."
1000061054.txt,I think it's just being in contact with a different type of people and feeling more comfortable with them.
1000061054.txt,"[44:19]</p> One thing that always got me, you know, my father would say ""Let's all sit down and have a nice big meal like a normal family"" and you see all these families where you live, they don't sit down to a ten-course meal."
1000061054.txt,and I know that my reactions to them aren't really far out because my sisters feel the same way.
1000061054.txt,"Lately, I've just felt like I couldn't talk to my two sisters that are around. This one girlfriend of mine-I just felt much closer to her and everything.</p> I called her up the other night-we were talking-and I called her up."
1000061054.txt,I think now-or you've at least gotten the idea that from what I said that I kind of panic when something changes. And I was just thinking about how I was relating to my two sisters
1000061054.txt,"Well I felt bad. I was hoping it wouldn't be a lasting thing, you know?"
1000061054.txt,"but I felt twice as bad because here I get this money in the mail today and everything.</p> I don't know, because... </p> ...she gave me some money over the weekend which would usually be enough for the whole week."
1000061054.txt,"I don't think she was trying to get me upset but I-you know, the more I think about it, I really don't know. I just kind of feel bad because she's there with my father and he's virtually impossible to live with."
1000061054.txt,"She likes to see Adrian, but I just feel bad again because she gets so tired from playing with him a lot. And she won't-she won't say she's really tired."
1000061054.txt,I feel bad she has to do it because she is the martyr type.</p> I'm afraid of hurting her.</p>
1000061054.txt,"I'm afraid of hurting her.</p> Yeah, because she's hurt all the time."
1000061054.txt,but I-but I don't feel-like I don't have all those things in life to back me up right now and he's not going to give it to me tomorrow.
1000061054.txt,"When I don't have money, Diane, when I don't have money I'm much better off and happier than when I have it and I have to worry about all my-I have to spend it and everything. It's true."
1000061054.txt,"Well, I don't-no I don't-I don't really-well I feel like Robert, Adrian and I are family but I don't feel like I'm his wife, you know, or I'm married to him."
1000061054.txt,"but I don't feel like I'm his wife, you know, or I'm married to him. Although, maybe I'd feel married to him, but I don't feel like I'm-you know, like I wouldn't call myself his wife or I'm sure-I don't think he'd call-or I'd call him my husband."
1000061054.txt,"Although, maybe I'd feel married to him, but I don't feel like I'm-you know, like I wouldn't call myself his wife or I'm sure-I don't think he'd call-or I'd call him my husband. (inaudible 33:06) said that to me once and it bothered me because she said-I don't know-she'd say-she said ""After all, you're his wife"""
1000061054.txt,"I think I'm really afraid to get married.</p> Because like, you know, I've-I haven't seen a marriage that's really lasted twenty years that's really happy. I mean, some of the stories my mom tells about her married friends in the suburbs and stuff it's really like a freak show."
1000061054.txt,"I think it's true for a lot of people because the minute you start pinning down words and asking for definitions and-I don't want to sound like I'm a hip person or something but it's true-I've always disliked red tape, you know, things that consume time or just a lot of paperwork and things that don't really get down to the brass tacks and stuff"
1000061054.txt,"but it's true-I've always disliked red tape, you know, things that consume time or just a lot of paperwork and things that don't really get down to the brass tacks and stuff and I don't know, I don't think it's really important to a lot of people to say that ""Oh, he's my husband and I'm his wife"" and everything and just come across as a family and just relate to each other really well."
1000061054.txt,"It just isn't as nice as before and it just sort of messes up the feeling for me. I've always been like that, Diane, but I haven't been able to realize it to explain it until just recently.</p> Yeah, because, like, like, I think you've gathered from all the sessions so far that the minute I start going over something-well, I think it's true of everybody-just gets more reaction to it and you're not fully sure how it felt in the first place. </p>"
1000061054.txt,"Possibly because like I told you before, I don't really feel secure about my own-my thinking and everything.</p> Because no matter what it is, there's always these other people adding their two cents or influencing it in some way.</p>"
1000061054.txt,I think it's just being in contact with a different type of people and feeling more comfortable with them. But I don'-I guess it is also just getting away from my parents there.</p>
1000061054.txt,"[44:19]</p> One thing that always got me, you know, my father would say ""Let's all sit down and have a nice big meal like a normal family"" and you see all these families where you live, they don't sit down to a ten-course meal. The kids are all bopping in and out picking up sandwiches and stuff like that or ask can they be excused."
1004824695.txt,"So, any extra activity right now has been exhausting, so it's not necessarily—I don't feel neglected."
1004824695.txt,"the phrase over at the hospital, because at this point I'm just really frustrated."
1004824695.txt,"But I think it's stress, you know."
1004824695.txt,"Yeah, I feel like I should be able to vaguely control at least part of this kind of thing, you know, but I can't."
1004824695.txt,"But I still feel like maybe I am being disrespectful on some level to his struggles right now, you know?"
1004824695.txt,"I just feel like—and this is—I hate being one of those people that's very black and white in this though, but I really feel like it's, like, the easiest way not to, like, have these troubles is just never to go there."
1004824695.txt,"That makes it easier...</p> I used to get really, really angry that they were not being—because they're all claiming that they really want to help with his recovery, they want to be really, like, forthcoming, but they're not telling me what's going on."
1004824695.txt,"And (pause) at this point, maybe I am ridiculous but I feel like they did this to him, they should undo it, you know."
1004824695.txt,"the phrase over at the hospital, because at this point I'm just really frustrated. I have the data to show that I am getting an awful lot of exercise, I'm gaining weight like crazy, I'm taking in very minimal amounts of food."
1004824695.txt,And I'm just getting so angry because I'm doing all the right things and I'm not getting what I'm supposed to be getting out of this.
1004824695.txt,"And it feels just the one thing I can control, you know. I should be able to control."
1004824695.txt,"Like, because I throw up a lot from not, like, from stress. Or not like a lot, but there are periods of time where I have thrown up more than a few times in a week, you know."
1004824695.txt,"But I think it's stress, you know. I haven't in over a week, but it's not like a binge-purge kind of thing."
1004824695.txt,"I'm kind of getting afraid to go to the dentist because of that. And, you know, it's just, like, I'm just freaking sick of all of this, you know."
1004824695.txt,"Yeah, I feel like I should be able to vaguely control at least part of this kind of thing, you know, but I can't. And it's making me so damn angry."
1004824695.txt,"And it's making me so damn angry. So, I actually—I sort of avoid finding a new gynecologist even, because I'm officially at the weight right now where my birth control doesn't work anymore."
1004824695.txt,"He just shuts down. Like, I don't know what the hell he's doing right now."
1004824695.txt,"I don't necessarily know all the time he's—he (inaudible at 17:39) upset about, like, eleven days of sobriety, but, like, at this point in my life right now I don't necessarily disseminate that the pornographic use with the video game playing that much anymore. Because the same thing, it's like this obsessive, like—I'm trying to remember the word that we talked about using this."
1004824695.txt,"And (pause) at this point, maybe I am ridiculous but I feel like they did this to him, they should undo it, you know. We can't afford it—if we could afford it, it would be a different story."
1004532456.txt,Because I'm kind of feeling that guilt again.
1004532456.txt,"And that's the guilt that's coming in is because I am around, I am available."
1004532456.txt,"But I do have different ways of hiding my emotions, of covering up what I'm really feeling."
1004532456.txt,That's kind of how I feel mentally.
1004532456.txt,I feel like my mind is so clear.
1004532456.txt,Absolutely it's a worry about myself.
1004532456.txt,And for me that's a... a... a... a - it kind of is exactly what I'm feeling.
1004532456.txt,Is that I am feeling this sense that that's me.
1004532456.txt,"That is me doing what I did to hide my problems, to cover up what I was really feeling instead of getting it out there."
1004532456.txt,Because I'm kind of feeling that guilt again. Because I - yesterday when I came home from school - and I was at my parent's house last night.
1004532456.txt,"And that's the guilt that's coming in is because I am around, I am available. Why am I not... why am I not working?"
1004532456.txt,"But again, the emotion part is eating me. It's eating at me where I don't like to see them."
1004532456.txt,"Because whenever I do get overwhelmed, when I get stressed out, when I get uncomfortable, I've always turned to it. Whether it be alcohol, whether it be drugs, whether it be tobacco."
1004532456.txt,When I get too emotionally riled up and too anxious when I cant' function anymore.</p> That's what - exactly.
1004532456.txt,And not get engaged or... or pissed off or just calm myself down. It is - and that's kind of what it was.
1004532456.txt,It's kind of like what I feel every time that I'm... I'm at the... at the restaurant.
1004532456.txt,"And I don't think I'm doing bad, that's when the anxiety kicks in. That's when the drive to do alcohol, to do drugs, to smoke a cigarette, to have a... a chew."
1004532456.txt,"[25:03]</p> I feel like I'm leaning towards it. And it's like I said to my cousin and my uncle is like, ""I'm not quitting..."
1004532456.txt,"Because I do feel those cravings, I do feel those needs to get high trying to take over my body.</p> Uh-hum.</p> I think it was after I..."
1004532456.txt,"you're on... when you're high or you're drunk or whatever, you feel invincible?</p> That's kind of how I feel mentally."
1004532456.txt,That's kind of how I feel mentally. I feel like my mind is so clear.
1004532456.txt,"this is why I do get nervous because I didn't smoke marijuana until I went back to the restaurant. I went back to the restaurant and was like, ""Oh, it's only marijuana."""
1004532456.txt,I felt so powerful. I kind of felt like someone who was in charge.</p>
1004532456.txt,I kind of felt like someone who was in charge.</p> They needed me and they knew who I was.
1004532456.txt,"And I kind of feel now that you mention it, I kind of feel like when she does this, I kind of feel like I see myself again. And it's like a splitting image of..."
1004532456.txt,And for me that's a... a... a... a - it kind of is exactly what I'm feeling. Is that I am feeling this sense that that's me.
1004532456.txt,"Is that I am feeling this sense that that's me. That is me doing what I did to hide my problems, to cover up what I was really feeling instead of getting it out there."
1004532456.txt,"And then the next day, I'll feel terrible. And then I'll wake up, and that problem is still there."
1000122145.txt,Why was I so down in physics?
1000122145.txt,"The other thing, I also made an analysis last week, or developed it over the weeks, of...that I am really attracted to a girl because she's my inferior and she's around me, and because she's around me, then, I can feel superior to her then, or I accept her as a challenge and it does my ego good to win her over."
1000122145.txt,I never really sat down and talked to Rich about important things.
1000122145.txt,"Zap, it hit, there I was behaving very consciously again, worrying about every word, worrying about how this person was looking with me, even though I was with the old, comfortable people.</p> Subsequent to, I think, my talk with Ted, she got to go...she doesn't like Laura at all, it's understandable."
1000122145.txt,"If it is ego, then I would only...if I were completely egocentric, I would only worry then, about, yeah, sure, I would only enjoy it if people thought well of me."
1000122145.txt,"Now, if I feel and act that way because I am egocentric, then I do it because I only want myself to look good."
1000122145.txt,"It's either that on a very...the analysis that I've made so far is just (inaudible) analysis that I came up with, and it's pleasing to me to have something settled on, and I'm not worried yet about what we're going to do about it, because I'm still talking about it, still hashing it through.</p>"
1000122145.txt,"Now, wait a minute, these are people I'm close to I'm worried about and the people that are...that isn't what I came here initially with."
1000122145.txt,"Why was I so down in physics? Well, I don't think it's a fair assessment to say, ""Well, I fell about it now, considering the last six months I'm going through."""
1000122145.txt,"It's a damn good answer, you know, I can really live comfortably with it, if I really want to deep down believe it. But, it's so hard to tell, because as I said, I don't think I've ever really had, sure, I've had feelings of my own, but I don't think I ever really come up with major decisions like (inaudible) decisions of my own."
1000122145.txt,"But, it's so hard to tell, because as I said, I don't think I've ever really had, sure, I've had feelings of my own, but I don't think I ever really come up with major decisions like (inaudible) decisions of my own. Well, that's where it lies there."
1000122145.txt,"The other thing, I also made an analysis last week, or developed it over the weeks, of...that I am really attracted to a girl because she's my inferior and she's around me, and because she's around me, then, I can feel superior to her then, or I accept her as a challenge and it does my ego good to win her over. I just want to point out, as a good scientist that there's not enough data to make any good (inaudible) inference.</p>"
1000122145.txt,"I moved down the (inaudible) and turns out the people across the (inaudible), are four girls living there, three of whom were single, three of whom there was no attraction, as far as I'm concerned, whatsoever. They just were too different."
1000122145.txt,"Now, I tried to think about how I interact with these people and how it fits in with the me, and I think it boils down to pretty much to a mistake, because the relationships actually failed. I never really sat down and talked to Rich about important things."
1000122145.txt,"Zap, it hit, there I was behaving very consciously again, worrying about every word, worrying about how this person was looking with me, even though I was with the old, comfortable people.</p> Subsequent to, I think, my talk with Ted, she got to go...she doesn't like Laura at all, it's understandable. I'm trying to figure out..."
1000122145.txt,"No matter what comes into the conversation she's always worried about herself. Maybe it's just that I found an identity with her, maybe I'm egocentric, too, and that's why it's, that's why I'd be comfortable with her."
1000122145.txt,"Now, my actions, I shouldn't' say my feelings. Now, what the drives are is the problem."
1000122145.txt,"Why do I feel that way, why do I act that way? Now, if I feel and act that way because I am egocentric, then I do it because I only want myself to look good."
1000122145.txt,"Now, if I feel and act that way because I am egocentric, then I do it because I only want myself to look good. On the other hand, if I do it because of other centric, well, then I do it because I want them to be pleased with me and therefore, they will be comfortable."
1000122145.txt,"And it all, I think, boiled down to a competition thing. And, oh, Ted's statement that I surround myself with inferiors, and the things that I do, seem to be born out, that I was superior in this group, and I certainly, there were certainly other groups I could have been, lived with, and been around, but this was the group I chose, because there was no challenge there, and I guess Mike represented a challenge.</p>"
1000122145.txt,"It's either that on a very...the analysis that I've made so far is just (inaudible) analysis that I came up with, and it's pleasing to me to have something settled on, and I'm not worried yet about what we're going to do about it, because I'm still talking about it, still hashing it through.</p> But I'm coming up with more examples to reinforce that this is the case."
1000122145.txt,"so I feel good."" As a matter of fact, he's clearly a superior."
1000122145.txt,"Might...I don't know, but I might have had a fear of surrounding myself with superiors, (inaudible) with physicists.</p> That's so long ago, I don't know what the motivating force was."
1002133157.txt,"Of course for one thing, frankly, the times I have felt I wanted to have some - you know, sex for relief, it's just too easy to masturbate."
1002133157.txt,Because I don't think I'm afraid in the sense of being afraid of the girls.</p>
1002133157.txt,"I mean, you know, I'm not physically afraid or even emotionally afraid, I don't think."
1002133157.txt,I think what I'm afraid of is probably just the going out and the first...
1002133157.txt,"I'm really afraid of the first contact, the - how to get into it."
1002133157.txt,I don't think I feel that I'm a pretty shitty individual.
1002133157.txt,"When I am alone and just working with myself, I cannot worry about whether I am being accepted or not accepted."
1002133157.txt,"At least I don't feel like I'm absolutely - you know, and not involved about this.</p> No.</p>"
1002133157.txt,Even now the panic has been kind of how great she's going to think I am.
1002133157.txt,"You know, I feel like I'm in a big performance."
1002133157.txt,And I'm - in fact I feel better about it.
1002133157.txt,"And I feel that I should wake up around 8:00 or 9:00, you know, 8:30 in the morning. And it's to my advantage to wake up then, because then I can get a day started."
1002133157.txt,"and I thought, ""Well I'll flop down."" I was sort of - I had been drawing all day and my eyes were tired."
1002133157.txt,"Well up until just recently - over the last year - I've always been able to flop down and say I'm going to sleep for an hour, and sleep for an hour and wake up.</p> And now I'm getting, you know, like I don't know, an attitude if I can sleep..."
1002133157.txt,"And, you know, I have the feeling that maybe I'm sort of hiding behind sleeping, you know. I know - I don't - I'm not getting the sex I would like."
1002133157.txt,"Of course for one thing, frankly, the times I have felt I wanted to have some - you know, sex for relief, it's just too easy to masturbate. You know, I can always take care of myself that way, which isn't - you know, doesn't really solve the problem particularly.</p>"
1002133157.txt,"Because I don't think I'm afraid in the sense of being afraid of the girls.</p> I mean, you know, I'm not physically afraid or even emotionally afraid, I don't think."

1002133157.txt,"And I go out with this great feeling of, ""Gee. You know, I'm God's gift to women."""
1002133157.txt,That's where I get bogged down. And that was part of...
1002133157.txt,"But part of this is that, you know, when I start thinking about, well the idea of, you know, going out and meeting people I start getting A, financially afraid. [0:29:07.7]</p> Because, you know, it's..."
1002133157.txt,I don't think I feel that I'm a pretty shitty individual. I think I have more of a tendency to think I'm like the grandest little thing that ever hit the earth.
1002133157.txt,"When I am alone and just working with myself, I cannot worry about whether I am being accepted or not accepted. Because I can get very absorbed in what I am working at.</p>"

1002133157.txt,"I feel fine. And I put myself in a position often of being, you know, like forcing her to be aggressive at times.</p>"
1002133157.txt,"But...</p> Well always.</p> You know, I don't think I ever felt I approached a guy.</p> Except putting myself in a place, in a location where it was obvious that I was out there to be picked up.</p>"
1002133157.txt,And I'm - in fact I feel better about it. I have also been...</p> ...a new relationship I took up a few nights ago - well not a few nights ago.
1004532442.txt,And about my ability to be in a situation that involves other people (laughs) now that I'm not as afraid that these people say to me can trigger those intense hallucinations that I was having.
1004532442.txt,I feel like there's been a period of a few years that I've been looking for a book that had a character I could relate to and I just haven't been able to find any characters that I could relate to in any books.
1004532442.txt,"But, sort of having confirmed that my worst fears are true, like someone telling me it's definitive was really a whoa."
1004532442.txt,"When she says these things (sighs), I don't know that it's, she like sat down and thought to herself if I think this is a good idea."
1004532442.txt,"Or whether I, what I say, it's still not clear to me exactly how I feel about this."
1004532442.txt,It just made me feel a lot more positive about the future. And about my ability to be in a situation that involves other people (laughs) now that I'm not as afraid that these people say to me can trigger those intense hallucinations that I was having.
1004532442.txt,"So, I had mixed feelings about it when it would happen because it was related to topics that one hand I guess it's helpful to get clues about what this other personality wants me to think about and focus on."
1004532442.txt,"And there were sort of things when like my colleagues would say things that stressed me out or certain topics would come up in class that sort of upset me, the dizziness and nausea, like that was never constructive in the way that the hallucinations were. Because it's like, ok"
1004532442.txt,I don't need to like feel like I'm going to like fall over or vomit (laughs). [That was very stressful] (ph).
1004532442.txt,"But, I still felt like I had more control than a completely different person who like, who knows what anyone can say at any given moment. Except I sort of know that you probably aren't going to say any like totally jerkish thing that [inaudible] (laughs) unlike my colleagues."
1004532442.txt,And it just felt so familiar (laughs). I feel like there's been a period of a few years that I've been looking for a book that had a character I could relate to and I just haven't been able to find any characters that I could relate to in any books.
1004532442.txt,"So that really hit close to home and just felt that, felt so painful and then I go back and forth between being able to construct a world view in which things are sort of ok right now because I'm working on my novel and working on getting better and like that's alright."
1004532442.txt,"but I spend a lot of time worrying about what people were thinking.</p> And that I'd sort of managed to say like, well, I just won't think about them."
1004532442.txt,"When she says these things (sighs), I don't know that it's, she like sat down and thought to herself if I think this is a good idea. It's like she just lost her ability to not say these things to me after repressing it for weeks or something."
1004532442.txt,"And second, I feel like I owe her, like being nice to her at the very least because she really did like try very hard to be a good mother and put a lot of thought on how best to raise me and spent so much time with me.</p> I mean, I don't think she's been very destructive."
1004532442.txt,"[00:00:31]</p> But, she does better than to make me feel helpless.</p> [inaudible] I, I think I'm sort of definitely stuck in this regard."
1004532442.txt,"I think I still do feel guilty like saying negative things about her. And I think there's sort of an ideal thing that happens when you become and adult where, I mean it's like a later life version of what Melanie Kriner talks about with recognizing the mother as the good breast and the bad breast, sometimes bad, sometimes not."
1004532442.txt,"But I'm still not clear about whether I should feel guilty about saying it or not. Or whether I, what I say, it's still not clear to me exactly how I feel about this."
1004532442.txt,"I mean something seems very depressing about being critical, too critical of and angry towards someone who loves you and wants the best of you and has spent their life trying to make that happen and has made that the centerpiece of their life. To a degree that was almost, you know I almost wish she had kept up with her other interests more; tried less hard to be the best mother to me."
1004532442.txt,"She feels responsible to think things through to come up with the best solution and give that to me. And because just not because of her superior neurosis it's like she thinks like she's being helpful and giving me the gift of her effort, but it doesn't make it much..."
1004538608.txt,And you're actually so upset I don't want to be in the car with you driving and also I'm exhausted from this meltdown
1004538608.txt,I was feeling like I just want to go to this book reading and then hang out and you were having this meltdown and it's all about you and you've really been talking about a lot of things.
1004538608.txt,"and it was, it was annoying, so I'm like I feel like your passive-aggressively telling me about this,"
1004538608.txt,but I'm like fat acceptance is one of those things where I'm like if you're feeling (inaudible 00:26:29)
1004538608.txt,"I'm always like, well I'm feeling fat, and I'm always like uhh!"
1004538608.txt,"Like the other thing I'm always sympathetic towards is like (sighs) light-skinned people of color who have like some crazy...like have like weird internalized racism or feeling like, I mean it's really common amongst biracial people this feeling like, ya know, I'm not really black."
1004538608.txt,"And like, ya know, I just like...I kinda feel bad for anyone in that situation because it's horrible (laughs)"
1004538608.txt,I do not want...like this is not what I want (pause) and it also feels super one-sided because (pause)
1004538608.txt,"Like, like I don't know it's like it feels differently both ways, um..."
1004538608.txt,"I guess the other thing is I also feel like (pause) mmm, for both of them I'm like there are resources out there."
1004538608.txt,"I'm not your only option and I don't like feeling like I'm here for you just to emotionally dump on me (pause) um (pause) and what frustrates me, which is always frustrating me, is I never really know...I never feel like I have a great way to sort of stop that pattern, or to say like I really need you to stop doing that, um (pause) because I always feel guilty about saying that, and I feel bad saying that to someone who is like really upset but on the other hand like I just really don't feel like...and (inaudible at 00:34:03) to being like sucky and upsetting and like emotional like also things."
1004538608.txt,"And I can't help...</p> ...I need to put mine on before I can assist someone else, and I don't feel like I'm at all like, ya know, in an emotionally stable, awesome place to like help someone else out very much."
1004538608.txt,"I...and not just Lucy, like I mean I just that was just like...that night I just felt like I was being dragged down more than anything else."
1004538608.txt,"And part of me...like the other thing I was also feeling like, is I'm like is (sighs)...which actually I do feel—it sounds a little callous - but I feel like"
1004538608.txt,"okay, if you feel really depressed and you can't leave the house, you should just say I'm really depressed and can't leave the house."
1004538608.txt,"The best way I can describe it is I just felt like, like get your shit together."
1004538608.txt,It's also like I...when I'm feeling really depressed I worry about like...
1004538608.txt,"I think it's okay to say I'm feeling depressed, like I just need to cancel tonight, but I also feel like ohh...like I don't wanta be..."
1004538608.txt,I don't want my friends to think of me as that like that really depressed person who's always really sad or whatever.</p>
1004538608.txt,"but I actually feel like well, ya know, I've managed to consistently like get out of bed, feed myself, clothe myself, go to work, ya know, go to school, like...and some days that feels like that was the hardest thing I did, like, um, (pause) (sighs) which is frustrating because I'm kinda like, uh, like I do think like...like sometimes I do think like that was a lot, like I do feel like"
1004538608.txt,I'm feeling these things
1004538608.txt,And I'm cool and not like...</p> ...depressed.
1004538608.txt,"I think like it didn't...like she thought so much about herself and not really acknowledging like that I was feeling crappy, and like didn't like drop me a line (inaudible to 00:45:10)"
1004538608.txt,Over the weekend I was mostly feeling like this person being mad and frustrated and kind of taken advantage of in a way.
1004538608.txt,"And so she starts ranting about how she's mad about that, and then Ashby turns to her and snaps something like you're being really rude and reductive and then stomps off, cuz Ashby's in a bad mood and I'm like...</p>"
1004538608.txt,"yeah, I feel like people are saying that I'm bad and stupid for asking about masculine fashion and that I shouldn't ask about it because like that's a horrible thing to do. Then that's okay"
1004538608.txt,"I didn't feel that, but whatever, ya know. So like it's a possibility, and (pause)"
1004538608.txt,"she just was like, I don't know, like she was, ya know, really upset and crying and sort of like asking me why did my friends do these things and I'm like I wasn't there for the conversation."
1004538608.txt,"And so after a half hour she kinda was calmed down enough that I felt like I could, ya know, maybe get my book signed, say hi or something, and (pause) she...and a couple times was like do you want to go out for drinks after this?"
1004538608.txt,"Like, I feel like if you have an enormous meltdown in public usually means...like for someone to just stay home on the couch it like it usually means she was having a crappy day.</p>"
1000122150.txt,And I looked back on the weekend...and was very depressed because it was sort of a reversion back to before I even started coming to you.
1000122150.txt,", I really...I didn't feel bad about feeling bad I just was feeling bad."
1000122150.txt,I was more and more worried about how I was behaving rather than why I was behaving that way.
1000122150.txt,What makes me feel bad when I sit here and talk to you is the fact that I'm so guided by those expectations.
1000122150.txt,"I remembered it as you saying ""why""</p> No, but everyone knows what his feelings are don't they? </p>"
1000122150.txt,"Not what...ah, yeah, what my feelings... I don't think there ever was a question in my mind what my feelings were."
1000122150.txt,I don't know what you mean by knowing what your feelings are.
1000122150.txt,Do you think that I knew what my feelings were at most junctures?
1000122150.txt,Well I just...to not know what one's feelings are is sort of a contradiction in terms.
1000122150.txt,"If I pass it, it's all down hill."
1000122150.txt,"And I would, you know, I really felt bad. And that's really...now the fact that I felt bad makes me feel just horrible."
1000122150.txt,I felt bad because of the way I looked and now looking back on it I felt bad that I felt bad. But there's just no denying it.
1000122150.txt,"Its not like something you can rationally say, ""Well, I simply felt out of place."" I blew the whole thing that was going to be so cool."
1000122150.txt,"I was more and more worried about how I was behaving rather than why I was behaving that way. Although I still a little bit back there I was thinking about it, you know, and the whole thing here."
1000122150.txt,"well it's the same thing, see I feel good when other people recognize something I've done. Therefore it's my own expectation to do something because then...it's not so much doing it, it's having it recognized.</p>"
1000122150.txt,"So, no, that isn't what makes me feel bad. I think what makes me feel bad...you mean the person that's talking to you right now.(inaudible/cross talk at 0:21:00.2)"
1000122150.txt,I think what makes me feel bad...you mean the person that's talking to you right now.(inaudible/cross talk at 0:21:00.2) What makes me feel bad when I sit here and talk to you is the fact that I'm so guided by those expectations.
1000122150.txt,"No, you were worried more about feelings, so a person knows why his feelings are the way they are. I think that's what you said."
1000122150.txt,I don't know what you mean by knowing what your feelings are. Do you think that I knew what my feelings were at most junctures?
1000122150.txt,"it's sad but true and that seems to be the case. </p> Yeah, I'm much better with groups of people."
1000122150.txt,I really feel like Dick Nixon. That he seems to be that kind of person.
1000122150.txt,"Well I...the point is...that there have been times as I have said before, when I come in here really fired up, you know, and felt good about things, and other times... I mean today wasn't a joyful session; I mean there isn't a lot of happy stuff to say about myself...(inaudible at 0:53:13.4)"
1000122150.txt,"If I pass it, it's all down hill. And if I don't pass it things are really going to get goofed up."
1004538634.txt,"Her job is she's running a research study currently and I feel like since that's kind of her job to collect data information and then analyze it and put it to some use, I feel like she does that with her children as well and it's, like, for a lot of stuff I just don't know."
1004538634.txt,and so I sit down
1004538634.txt,(chuckles) I was feeling really frustrated.</p>
1004538634.txt,"Yeah, well, or when I feel like I'm the only, like, ""We're ready to do this."
1004538634.txt,"And then I feel like when I draw their attention to that I feel like I hurt their feelings 'cause I don't think they mean to, but that's the other thing."
1004538634.txt,"So I feel like those are kind of the ways, I guess, that I've maybe really damaged myself permanently."
1004538634.txt,"Yeah, 'cause it's like I have all these other things that I'm frustrated about that I complain about"
1004538634.txt,"I say that I'm upset because I'm not losing weight, but then drinking beers at a baseball game isn't gonna help that and, you know, (pause)"
1004538634.txt,"These are, I feel really close to the finish line, and a lot of times I just feel like I'm over this and it's not fair to them (pause) cause I just don't, I mean, I used to be so much more fun."
1004538634.txt,"And I just don't wanna, I'm really afraid that I've used up all my best kid energy on 10 years of kids that weren't mine, and whenever we do have kids that I'm gonna be over it"
1004538634.txt,I mean I'm not afraid that I'm gonna be neglectful or abusive or anything like that
1004538634.txt,"but I feel like I'll be so bored that it'll come off as, like I don't wanna be bored with my own kid."
1004538634.txt,"I don't feel really ""into"" my job right now, and it feels like that's all it's gonna be.</p>"
1004538634.txt,"Because of that and just because I'm tired of being, I'm isolated, I feel alone, I feel like I don't, I'm just tired of taking care of other people's children."
1004538634.txt,"I feel like all I do is take care of people, and this has no long-term payoff."
1004538634.txt,"I mean, I'm nervous about (pause) a lot of things."
1004538634.txt,And I'm really nervous that that's gonna happen again - really nervous.
1004538634.txt,I feel so bad for those poor marathoners today. It's gonna be awful.</p>
1004538634.txt,"Maybe she can't, but I feel like she can. And then I always feel like, and then I beat myself up with ""you need to be more patient"" ""you need to like let her - this is her kid."""
1004538634.txt,"[00:10:00]</p> Because I get frustrated when I get there in the morning and they haven't done it the way that I want them to do it. Like, why would you - I get pissed - like the morning that I got there and Hetty was refusing to put on underpants, so they just put a diaper on her."
1004538634.txt,"And so then I get irritated and, and, like, I wouldn't have done it that way - so you did it the wrong way. And so then I, like, you know, usually I come in and I sit with - they're all eating breakfast usually -"
1004538634.txt,"(chuckles) I was feeling really frustrated.</p> Yeah, well, or when I feel like I'm the only, like, ""We're ready to do this."
1004538634.txt,"Yeah, well, or when I feel like I'm the only, like, ""We're ready to do this. We want to do this,"" but what they mean is ""We want you to do this."""
1004538634.txt,"They're not intentionally - they're just afraid of making their kids upset. They always have been and I know that about them, but the kids are gonna get upset no matter what, no matter if it's you or me or whoever it is so the thing that hasn't kicked in with them in the last three years (chuckles) is that, like, by you taking the easy road and fixing whatever it is that needs to get done and making them not upset, I'm the one who always has to go back and kind of like clean it up and has to be the bad guy and has to say like ""No, you can't, like, wear your nightgown outside again 'cause it's disgusting and dirty and, like, we need to wash it 'cause it's laundry day."""
1004538634.txt,"They always have been and I know that about them, but the kids are gonna get upset no matter what, no matter if it's you or me or whoever it is so the thing that hasn't kicked in with them in the last three years (chuckles) is that, like, by you taking the easy road and fixing whatever it is that needs to get done and making them not upset, I'm the one who always has to go back and kind of like clean it up and has to be the bad guy and has to say like ""No, you can't, like, wear your nightgown outside again 'cause it's disgusting and dirty and, like, we need to wash it 'cause it's laundry day."" It's things like that."
1004538634.txt,"I feel really guilty about that. And I feel, like I wonder a lot of times like did I damage this kid by not, like I love her because I've been taking care of her for the last three years almost."
1004538634.txt,"And I feel, like I wonder a lot of times like did I damage this kid by not, like I love her because I've been taking care of her for the last three years almost. But there are parts of her personality that really irritate me and I see a lot of her similarities."
1004538634.txt,"Yeah, 'cause it's like I have all these other things that I'm frustrated about that I complain about but then what is this?"
1004538634.txt,"And I know there's shades in between there, that there's a very happy meeting place, but it just doesn't feel like that a lot of times. [00:28:50]</p> I think that I always only see the negative and that I only always - unless I'm not doing everything exactly perfectly right, like eating oatmeal for breakfast and greens the rest of the day - then I'm in a bad place and I don't, like, I'll just pick apart the fact that, like, ""oh, and then you had like mac & cheese for lunch with the girls""."
1004538634.txt,But it feels like it. It feels like I might as well have just gone on a bender and lost total control because I'm beating myself up the same.
1004538620.txt,Sometimes it's because of the fact that I don't really feel like there's anything immediately to talk about.</p>
1004538620.txt,"I come from a family that doesn't really understand boundaries when it comes to work and overdoing it, and so I've got very valid reasons to be worried about them, ya know."
1004538620.txt,They don't know that I'm depressed.
1004538620.txt,"Plus my dad worries too much as is, ya know, about life, so he doesn't need to worry about me.</p>"
1004538620.txt,I'd sit down.
1004538620.txt,Maybe it was because of the fact I didn't want to be kinda down and then run into people I know like I had...</p> ...ya know to go out to get some things fixed and all the stuff
1004538620.txt,Something...it used to be so second nature to me to be like that that I really felt like when I was on campus I was becoming who I was and now I'm not so much like that
1004538620.txt,"and so I feel really embarr...at the time I'm also wanting to be perpetually young I also feel embarrassed for being immature, which is even weirder I know."
1004538620.txt,Sometimes it's because of the fact that I don't really feel like there's anything immediately to talk about.</p> I don't really know what it is.
1004538620.txt,"I come from a family that doesn't really understand boundaries when it comes to work and overdoing it, and so I've got very valid reasons to be worried about them, ya know. My dad was up at 4:30, 5:00 a.m. like the whole time I was there, ya know getting work done and that kind of stuff."
1004538620.txt,"Plus my dad worries too much as is, ya know, about life, so he doesn't need to worry about me.</p> But, ya know, my mom is like have you thought about this?"
1004538620.txt,"Maybe it was because of the fact I didn't want to be kinda down and then run into people I know like I had...</p> ...ya know to go out to get some things fixed and all the stuff and I didn't want to kind of be around, like be kinda like in a bad place when that happened.</p>"
1004538620.txt,"Feeling old. And, um, (pause) it's not that I really..."
1004538620.txt,I think that part of the reason why I feel so much regret is because of the fact that I did actually have a lot of fun and a lot of good times but like I guess I've always been expecting more.
1004538620.txt,"But I really felt like I was putting off a lot of things to go...like to be able to go out and do stuff as much as...like the time that we...we did some really silly things but nothing like, specifically like oh, this is an adventure when we did that, so I don't know. Well, that's not entirely true."
1004538620.txt,Something...it used to be so second nature to me to be like that that I really felt like when I was on campus I was becoming who I was and now I'm not so much like that and it's just...
1004538620.txt,"Okay, well I'm going to take it down and we're gonna light it on fire in the parking lot.</p>"
1004538620.txt,"and so I feel really embarr...at the time I'm also wanting to be perpetually young I also feel embarrassed for being immature, which is even weirder I know. I just want to basically be able to pause my body at a certain age and still be older in my head I think."
1004538620.txt,"It made me feel like maybe this was going to be a little too much of a good time, so... but yeah that group came out every year to do some stuff and, um, ya know, at the time it was doing lots of stuff related to that, so it was pretty cool."
1000017869.txt,"I thought you weren't feeling well because my girlfriend said, you know when she called she didn't sound like she was feeling too well."
1000017869.txt,"So I said, ""Oh well, she's probably not feeling (inaudible at 0:00:27.4)."""
1000017869.txt,You know and all this bull shit that even as a little kid I was afraid and I didn't know why.
1000017869.txt,"I knew she felt bad because she wasn't there, but you know like....0:12:03.6</p> (crying)"
1000017869.txt,"And now it's like, I don't know I just feel like, I'm almost afraid."
1000017869.txt,I'm afraid of getting real close.
1000017869.txt,"I'm afraid like, I get so paranoid."
1000017869.txt,They all said they were real sad to see me go because they really liked me and I really liked them.
1000017869.txt,"It's like, and I kind of feel good about it because now I can..."
1000017869.txt,It's a nice feeling for me to have somebody say that even though they don't love me.
1000017869.txt,"But it's still, it's still I'm actually afraid."
1000017869.txt,I'm afraid to ask them.
1000017869.txt,And it's like I'm so afraid to ask them partly because I'm afraid they're going to say no.
1000017869.txt,"But it just, I think it just comes right down to the fact that I'm afraid somebody's going to say no."
1000017869.txt,I have been so afraid of that.
1000017869.txt,I think I felt like I was a little bit used at Foley's.</p>
1000017869.txt,and it's like I'm afraid this is going to happen again.
1000017869.txt,"It's just like, it's very easy for me to feel for other people."
1000017869.txt,but like I'm just afraid to do it a lots of times.
1000017869.txt,It's so funny because I'm not afraid in the office.
1000017869.txt,And then I went out to have a hamburger because I was feeling kind of low.
1000017869.txt,But I was afraid.
1000017869.txt,"But see I was afraid because, I can't really explain it."
1000017869.txt,Maybe I was afraid I would lose him.
1000017869.txt,"Maybe I was afraid he wouldn't like me anymore, you know."
1000017869.txt,"And maybe, maybe it was just because I was afraid partly not only that"
1000017869.txt,but I was afraid I would lose him you know like one way or another.
1000017869.txt,"And you know, it was a terrible feeling just to say like, you know like, almost like I was nothing."
1000017869.txt,"And it's like, I say, I don't mind being friends with somebody and feeling a friendship and doing things"
1000017869.txt,Because it was always like I was afraid they didn't like me.
1004532480.txt,so now I'm stressed about all the work I didn't do over the weekend and now I have to get done.
1004532480.txt,"Like I want him to be in jail, not I don't know, he just gets to I don't know, I don't know that it makes me feel so bad for my stepmother that she's now a single mother and he's just ordering room service and watching TV all day."
1004532480.txt,"I don't know why I'm stressing about this, he does not think about this at all and I am so stressed out about it."
1004532480.txt,"so now I'm stressed about all the work I didn't do over the weekend and now I have to get done. Um, so today's going to be a really long day."
1004532480.txt,"Like I want him to be in jail, not I don't know, he just gets to I don't know, I don't know that it makes me feel so bad for my stepmother that she's now a single mother and he's just ordering room service and watching TV all day. I don't know that that's what he's doing, but, it's just frustrating."
1000016550.txt,"I says ""I must have been irritated at you."""
1000016550.txt,"Okay, so I'm irritated...(Phone"
1000016550.txt,It was like-it was like a feeling where I'm really anxious and uptight.
1000016550.txt,"Yeah, I didn't-I must have felt like-um-I can't put it in-I felt like-like I felt three days ago when a doorbell rang-I was-at that time-this was Sunday night and it was a girl I haven't seen for a long time who we used to-I used to sleep with."
1000016550.txt,"And when he just had sat down he introduced me to his girl and I introduced to my date and he said-she said-he said she-his date lives at 4500 North and my-and I blurted it out-you know, I didn't really think about it."
1000016550.txt,"I had the feeling-which I was almost aware of while I was having it, that my date was more animated when she was talking to him than to me."
1000016550.txt,Which it-a weird reaction-it was like-it was like I felt that she wanted to go because of this other guy and not because of me.
1000016550.txt,"If I'm in that kind of situation where I feel like I am-I'm in an inferior position, that all these sorts of feelings go through me.</p>"
1000016550.txt,apparently I'm very relaxed and I never worry about anything.
1000016550.txt,"You know, okay, it's like apparently like I think of myself from the way I-you know, and the feelings I get."
1000016550.txt,"That I would say, then, would be a conscious feeling."
1000016550.txt,"I'm convinced I'm, you know, emotionally a cripple because I can't recognize what I'm feeling until later."
1000016550.txt,Because to me-to me to understand-it's incomprehensible why I would feel this way.
1000016550.txt,One of the questions I asked when I wrote to her was how she felt about that.
1000016550.txt,"If queer means that I was afraid of girls, I was afraid of them."
1000016550.txt,I was embarrassed as hell just to see him.
1000016550.txt,"And I think, I think some of me, you know, like I try to think it through and feel it through as to why I quit the thing.</p> And it's-the idea is not that I'm sitting on my ass all the time. I've been checking the papers.</p>"
1000016550.txt,"Okay, so I'm irritated...(Phone rings)...it's something that..."
1000016550.txt,"And I, you know, I feel like a dodo out there. Only on Tuesday, I was like, I played like my old self and there is a couple of guys down there who I played football with who I really-I get-they play basketball like babies."
1000016550.txt,"Only on Tuesday, I was like, I played like my old self and there is a couple of guys down there who I played football with who I really-I get-they play basketball like babies. That's my impression."
1000016550.txt,It was like-it was like a feeling where I'm really anxious and uptight. It's like...</p>
1000016550.txt,"I got mad at somebody in the bar last night and-not angry-I just go this-very disgusted with two girls and so-you know, like-I don't know-I don't know what made it. But I couldn't-I could do them, but it was a real effort and it was like I had to overcome-I had to constantly overcome a bunch of things coming in from the outside.</p>"
1000016550.txt,"Yeah, I didn't-I must have felt like-um-I can't put it in-I felt like-like I felt three days ago when a doorbell rang-I was-at that time-this was Sunday night and it was a girl I haven't seen for a long time who we used to-I used to sleep with. And she was over that night and in the morning the doorbell rang and I don't know who-I've noticed that-almost every morning somebody rings my damn doorbell."
1000016550.txt,But I had this-anyhow the doorbell rang-I had this feeling like-I can only describe it physically. My heart started beating faster and it was like...</p>
1000016550.txt,"but I don't-you know, I don't have that much feeling for her. And I mean it's just that-it's just like a..."
1000016550.txt,"it's like a guilty feeling, I guess. That's what guilty feelings are like."
1000016550.txt,"Either because I felt uneasy around her or... But it was like not only teasing her, but almost like insulting her in a grinning sort of way.</p>"
1000016550.txt,"And when he just had sat down he introduced me to his girl and I introduced to my date and he said-she said-he said she-his date lives at 4500 North and my-and I blurted it out-you know, I didn't really think about it. I said ""Boy, that's really G U, isn't it?""</p> Geographically Undesirable.</p>"
1000016550.txt,I had this feeling like-like I was sure I was never going to ask her out again. And it was like my way of getting back.</p>
1000016550.txt,"I would think I'd be more patronizing-like if I'm in a different position-if I'm in a position where I feel more-like I know more than the person I'm with or I know more than the other guy I'm with, then it's the other way. Then I'm very-"
1000133934.txt,(Laughs) I've been thinking — I'm feeling really frustrated about that.
1000133934.txt,Maybe it's not because I feel inadequate
1000133934.txt,When I get angry or then I'm feeling (inaudible at 1:20:45.3) but I'm also thinking that — I'm thinking of what the other person is — trying to think of what the other person is feeling.
1000133934.txt,or — it's like I never feel I'm all —
1000133934.txt,"Oh, even at the time I thought that it was wrong for me to feel like that because I was letting myself do that."
1000133934.txt,But it's because I feel like the way I should do usually — not —</p>
1000133934.txt,Maybe it's not because I feel inadequate maybe it's just (inaudible at 1:10:03.9)
1000133934.txt,I feel (inaudible at 1:12:50.5) at all.</p> I don't know how to (inaudible at 1:13:14.2)</p> That's it.
1000133934.txt,"I feel like I'm always talking about this. And because I'm always talking about this, I don't seem to be getting anywhere (inaudible at 1:18:47.4)</p>"
1000133934.txt,"And I think I feel (inaudible at 1:28:23.1) too much. And there was no reason for me to be bored or upset, I was (inaudible at 1:28:28.6)"
1000133934.txt,"And there was no reason for me to be bored or upset, I was (inaudible at 1:28:28.6) I was (inaudible at 1:28:30.0)"
1000133934.txt,And I started off (inaudible at 1:41:06.5) and getting depressed because I didn't want to go to this (inaudible at 1:41:11.4) And we were riding out there.
1000133934.txt,"Oh, even at the time I thought that it was wrong for me to feel like that because I was letting myself do that. I was letting myself react."
1000133934.txt,"On the way down here, I was thinking that I — whatever (inaudible at 1:43:54.9)</p> Well that's what I was —</p>"
1000133934.txt,I mean like I don't feel happy or something. And I'm trying real hard to do it like that.
1000094547.txt,"Because I am just so miserable when I am by myself half of the time, that I just feel like if I had somebody with me that I would be okay."
1000094547.txt,I am just feeling like I'm worn out right now.
1000094547.txt,"And -</p> That feels like, you know, when your head is just all clogged up, I have really bad allergies anyway, but when you just feel like, you're overwhelmed basically."
1000094547.txt,I mean I just feel like I want to like to go like my fantasy is Betty Ford Clinic.
1000094547.txt,"And I don't have to share it, I mean I am sharing it, but I don't have to like give of me in a way that makes me feel like I'm, you know, having to give up myself."
1000094547.txt,Its helps that I get more comfort for this experience.</p> Because it causes me to be anxious and deal with all the things that I am dealing with.
1000094547.txt,"Plus all this stuff that I am dealing with and I just, and when I say I just want to take a break, it's because that just all feels to overwhelming to me."
1000094547.txt,Because I am scared right now.
1000094547.txt,"I'm starting to feel anxious now, because I am just feel scared talking about all this stuff that is really bothering me."
1000094547.txt,So it's sad and it makes me even sadder.
1000094547.txt,"I'm just, I am sad because I am sad about the fact that I am not doing what I think I need to do make myself a better person and a stronger person."
1000094547.txt,I feel like I just need to sleep for like three days and like that is why I just want to go to like Betty Ford.
1000094547.txt,"Because I don't feel like I can allow myself to sleep, one."

1000094547.txt,"Well I am just wondering why, I don't know, why I am so like why I am so dependent on this relationship of like, you know, why am I feeling fear about it when, when I know its all good."
1000094547.txt,"And that's just, you know, I'm afraid it's going to go away."
1000094547.txt,"And I know me, and I am afraid I'm not going to be able to, you know, I get, people like, I meet a lot of people all of the time that I probably have, you know, relationships with."
1000094547.txt,"I probably was irritated at first just because I was like eh, now I have to wait a whole another week.</p>"
1000094547.txt,But I think initially I was a little bit irritated.
1000094547.txt,"You know, I feel like my life should be like more."
1000094547.txt,"Don't worry about it, I mean I'm fine.</p> I think that, you know, I just wanted you to tell me that what I was feeling was okay."
1000094547.txt,"And you know, because I feel like it isn't."
1000094547.txt,"Well because I just wanted to know what I am feeling about Carl and all these feelings that I am feeling maybe, that those feelings are okay.</p> That I am not being, you know, I think I am being pretty appropriate actually.</p>"
1000094547.txt,I feel like they are appropriate to the circumstances.
1000094547.txt,"So he basically had written how he was struggling about his feeling with Dan, but he really wanted, knew that it was just habitual and that he really needed to move on to a new relationship and meet somebody and this is all before him not me. And meanwhile I was seeing someone at that time anyway."
1000094547.txt,"Now I am very well, you know, can understand the fact that, duh he wanted to meet somebody new, he was working the way he needed to work to resolve his feelings with Dan, and that's okay and that's good."
1000094547.txt,"Because maybe somehow it just made me feel like he wasn't really sharing himself with me and letting me really know what was really going on with him. Instead he was just kind of giving me the, the pin up picture of it, the best version."
1000094547.txt,"And I feel like alone and like I need somebody's help, I just, not to help me, but just to be with me."
1000094547.txt,"I am just feeling like I'm worn out right now. Because I haven't slept very much for like two weeks, because last week was school and I had all that stuff going on and all these things have been going on and I just, I don't spend any time with myself like I used to."
1000094547.txt,"By loving me, so I feel loved and appreciated. By giving me attention and making me feel like someone does really care about me and that I am ok."
1000013366.txt,"but it's symbolic in some respects because I had a lot of really, really, really, really wonderful thoughts in preparation for the session why I was so anxious to get here because -</p>"
1000013366.txt,"And the anxiety or the fear that if I married Jemma or got totally in touch with Jemma, stayed in a relationship with Jemma, I would in effect, limit the opportunities to physically hug other women that I feel close to, feel a connection with."
1000013366.txt,Because that's what's come back to me from Jemma that she feels like she has grown and deepened and gained a great deal about self-respect; of empowerment in her negotiations with her husband in the divorce; just a good feeling about herself as a result of the relationship that we've had for the last year.
1000013366.txt,It was not unexpected but I guess I wanted - it wasn't entirely clear to me whether you wanted you felt that because of the particular place that Aidan was coming from any kind of hug or physical connection between us would be bad for our particular work as opposed to somebody else.
1000013366.txt,"your - yeah, it would be a nice way of hearing from you that you agree with me and that you are feeling that our therapy is going - I don't know, for example, whether you feel that our work from your point of view is going in a direction that you as a therapist approve of."
1000013366.txt,"but it's symbolic in some respects because I had a lot of really, really, really, really wonderful thoughts in preparation for the session why I was so anxious to get here because -</p> Yeah, something really clicked for me and the two things - I want to kind of deal with the thing that kind of clicked for me and then this phenomenon that I experienced of having these seemingly very, very clear insights that I figure are wonderful organizing principles for my life which don't necessarily stop working but ultimately get superseded weeks or months later by yet another overriding, organizing principle."
1000013366.txt,So I'm pleased that I feel able to express it to you. I don't begin to think that within the ethical restraints of psychotherapy that it would be permissible to you to do it even if you wanted to.
1000013366.txt,"But I want in this next period of my life to have a lot of wonderful women friends and in a profound way to connect to them and to feel that the non-verbal communications between us can say as much as the verbal because there's so much noise that comes out. [16:08]</p> Well, there's a lot of talking; a lot of intellectualizing"
1000013366.txt,"I think it would bring us even closer together and perhaps - I mean, with each week I feel that I'm exploring more and more of the terrain around me. The essence of who I am and what I'm all about to the extent that it may unlock even more of these kind of deep core feelings about what I am and this obsession about getting to the essence of how I can best organize my life with women because does it - by breaking up with Jemma or transitioning with Jemma from this exclusive, monogamous relationship we've had which looked like it might settle me into a very comfortable traditional path of being in a permanent committed relationship with her - as I become more convinced that that's not what I want for my life -"
1000013366.txt,"I think it can be enough to get a - I think that in the feelings that go into just a hug with a woman  -</p> I think it might stand for the same thing.</p> Validation and approval and just pure pleasure in having me as a companion and a symbol of a potentially long, enduring connection that we would be forming; that we would kind of come together as symbolic of the beginning of a friendship."
1000013366.txt,But if it became nothing more than just a - [22:23]</p> No. I think that's a fantasy but it doesn't feel like it needs to go in that direction. I think that's a little off the wall.
1000013366.txt,"Well, it stands for approval and good feelings and connection and warmth and celebration and just many, many, many wonderful things that I associate with more intimate physical contact with a woman in any way. My approach to having a sexual relationship with a woman is no longer what it used to be which was - in my 20s - much more of a predatory kind of thing."
1000013366.txt,And then it's come in the last several years to be much more about these feelings that I'm talking about today; a celebration and warmth and approval. But in a way that was not exploitative; that was not predatory; that made it feel as warm and wonderful to my companion as it was for me.
1000013366.txt,But in a way that was not exploitative; that was not predatory; that made it feel as warm and wonderful to my companion as it was for me. So that it would definitely not be something that I would want to do if somebody didn't want it; wasn't as gratified by it as I was.
1000013366.txt,"Because that's what's come back to me from Jemma that she feels like she has grown and deepened and gained a great deal about self-respect; of empowerment in her negotiations with her husband in the divorce; just a good feeling about herself as a result of the relationship that we've had for the last year. So it's reminded me that a wonderful physical relationship between a man and a woman that's based on non-exploitative, non-predatory, very shared open feelings of just wanting to support each other can be extraordinarily wonderful for the woman as well as for [Buds] (ph)."
1000013366.txt,"It was not unexpected but I guess I wanted - it wasn't entirely clear to me whether you wanted you felt that because of the particular place that Aidan was coming from any kind of hug or physical connection between us would be bad for our particular work as opposed to somebody else. You might say, ""I'm not foreclosed generally from hugging my patients if that's what I think is the right thing to do"
1000013366.txt,"""You're making - as your analyst, Aidan, I'm happy to hear that you're making good progress and I want to send you a message that from my point of view it feels right."" It would be nice again to have some symbol of your approval or"
1000013366.txt,And I think I feel now that I think I'm on to something but I'm not sure because I've had so many prior insights that I thought were life changing and turned out to have kind of just melted away over time.

1000013372.txt,"Yeah, I felt bad that she was feeling so bad."
1000013372.txt,"And then she feels that when I'm upset or unhappy, she's like, I don't know if we made a mistake, I don't know if we rushed into this."
1000013372.txt,"Yeah, I just haven't heard her act that way since when she was really depressed before"
1000013372.txt,"And he was asleep so I couldn't tell if he'd changed the locks or not, but I found out this morning that one of the locks was changed; so then I didn't feel so upset.</p> Tony, like you know, our communicating."
1000013372.txt,and I was really angry about...
1000013372.txt,So I talked to Tony and I was just venting about how upset I was.
1000013372.txt,I mean we can go back to the things I was talking about earlier about the crying and if I really am upset.
1000013372.txt,How I'm doing with the feelings that I might be more upset than I realize?</p> When my sister passed away my parents were getting divorced and I just kind of threw myself into my activities
1000013372.txt,But she's so afraid I think that people are not getting her point that he just repeats herself.
1000013372.txt,and she's not going to be upset with me
1000013372.txt,"I felt the fist few times when we were living together and people came to visit, I would be super sensitive to how he was behaving and if he was happy and I'd consistently be asking him, are you okay?"
1000013372.txt,"So that was a good insight, and I thought that I was just doing it to make sure that everything was okay, but when he explained to me what it was, that I would probably be upset if I was Tony, but I probably wouldn't be but, like if somebody was, are you okay, assuming that something was not okay when everything was fine.</p>"
1000013372.txt,The only time I hesitated was after she told me how depressed she was then I felt really bad that I had said those things to her about her behavior.
1000013372.txt,"Like today with the e-mail, like, getting back right away and saying, you know, I was so afraid he was just going to say, I don't want to go to New Zealand."
1000013372.txt,"Maybe he's scared that I'll spend all the money in there, but I doubt it."
1000013372.txt,"Before, I was like; I loved being with Tony because he just made me feel like I was on top of the world."
1000013372.txt,If she's been feeling this way for a year I think that maybe I should have known.
1000013372.txt,I mean she pretty much said she felt like she was dead.
1000013372.txt,"It's just, I feel bad."
1000013372.txt,[43:19]</p> I guess a little bit of me is scared that when the house is one
1000013372.txt,"she said that after I got married, you know I told you that my Dad stopped speaking to my Mom when she got married, which is like four months after my wedding, she told me that she felt like the life had been sucked out of her and that she told her husband that she's sick but she thinks - remember I told you she was sick? -"
1000013372.txt,"So she said she's going to increase her dosage of anti-depressant and once I left she felt like, you know, I felt really bad.</p> Yeah, I felt bad that she was feeling so bad."
1000013372.txt,"And then she feels that when I'm upset or unhappy, she's like, I don't know if we made a mistake, I don't know if we rushed into this. But she's like, I hate when you're unhappy, and I said I think a lot of this stuff is temporary."
1000013372.txt,I mean when I hear that she's unhappy I feel bad. Like when I hear that she and Harold aren't getting along I feel like she's got so many good qualities why should anybody treat her bad?
1000013372.txt,Like when I hear that she and Harold aren't getting along I feel like she's got so many good qualities why should anybody treat her bad? Though he's not treating her bad.
1000013372.txt,"I wrote her a letter I hope she feels better.</p> Yeah, I just haven't heard her act that way since when she was really depressed before"
1000013372.txt,"Yeah, I just haven't heard her act that way since when she was really depressed before and I thought that, you know, her work is going well, she's married and she has this house, and I thought that feeling settled would make her feel better."

1000013372.txt,I don't want to get in an argument or get upset while I was on vacation so I just let it slide.</p>
1000013372.txt,It feels good; when I leave I always feel better.</p> I don't know. I don't think that I'm that unhappy
1004528619.txt,And it's like I can't count the number of times I've sat down an looked at the computer and opened the software and just couldn't bring myself to open the materials library editor and just do it and get it done with and move on with my life.

1004687730.txt,[00:07:19] I feel like my capacity to obsess is one of the things that makes me good at this.
1004687730.txt,I mean I always am worried that I'm disappointing whomever I'm working for.
1004687730.txt,(chuckles) He feels like it's not good enough but he has to give it to me because he has to get it to a point where he can turn it in.

1004687730.txt,It's like the depression feels like it's taking away everything I like about myself and now it's the only thing that defines me.
1004687730.txt,"There are a few years in there where I didn't think of myself, primarily under the rubric of somebody who is depressed, and I was really proud of that."
1004687730.txt,At one time—I had to be twenty or something around there—I thought to myself that thinking of myself as not primarily someone who is depressed is how I'm going to get out of this.
1004687730.txt,"That's really important for not actually being depressed, and I think that was true."
1004687730.txt,"I kind of sat down intending to work several times yesterday and then I was like, ""No."

1004687730.txt,"You know, one of the thing I put in my cover letter as well as the things I say to myself to make myself feel better is I'm pretty detail-oriented. You can give me a job to catch other people's mistakes and I'm okay with that."

1004687730.txt,"I don't worry so much about asking other people look at my writing. I've kind of trained myself to get over that sensitivity because I think that having other people look at rough work is so important but, particularly around here, everybody's ego is so fragile."

1004687730.txt,He really wants people to read it but he kind of doesn't want anybody to read it because he doesn't feel like it's where he imagined it would be. That's my sense from filling in the gaps from every conversation with every other writer I've ever had.

1004687730.txt,It's not deliberate; it's something that I feel good about. I think work should be personal.
1004687730.txt,"I felt crippled in my ability to deal with people or to talk to people. It's like in the aftermath I'm like, ""Oh, this is what was going on with that person."""

1004528625.txt,You know it's just like I feel like he would be like that's a little intense
1004528625.txt,"He doesn't say that to me and he understands that I'm upset about it, but why, you know two days later, I'm annoyed about a little thing"
1004528625.txt,"Because I always feel like they'll look at me like you're a weirdo, that's really intense."
1004528625.txt,"But for the most part, I feel like I'm the only one who has had a different experience than that and since that you know, like I don't feel like anybody really raised me."
1004528625.txt,"I guess I just feel like I'm the only one who you know, I guess had kind of a trauma or has."
1004528625.txt,"I don't know, I guess it's also easier for me to let my emotions and my love for him take over and be - that be driving force, instead of like my rational brain. And so I'll just sometimes tell him things are okay when they're not okay, just because I love him"
1004528625.txt,"and I don't want to - it's either like the easiest way to get something done or I just don't want to hurt his feelings. And somebody else isn't going to necessarily do that, because they don't - it doesn't matter."
1004528625.txt,"Not so much - I mean now that he agreed to go see somebody, I feel like a little - I feel really relieved. I feel like it's the first time he's really wanted to help himself and, and I feel relief that like I'm not... (pause)"
1004528625.txt,"I just felt like I'm the only one that can, that can like fix this. I'm the only one that you're like talking to about these things, so I'm the only one can fix this, when in reality I know the only one that can fix it is him."
1004528625.txt,"But like I felt this pressure and I'm a little relieved of it now, just because I feel like he's kind of taking it into his own hands by doing something for himself."
1004528625.txt,"and I'm a little relieved of it now, just because I feel like he's kind of taking it into his own hands by doing something for himself. I don't know maybe that's crazy."
1004528625.txt,I don't feel like he's driving the ship. I feel like he's just bobbing along.
1004528625.txt,"I mean not stopped caring about it, but it was like it completely paled in comparison to the feelings that I had about my brother being that drunk and that sad sounding and that out of control, and that I had never - I hadn't heard him say he wanted to kill himself. I mean he wasn't saying I'm going to kill myself, but by saying I want to go face first over a cliff, hearing him say that, it made my feelings towards my situation with my dad feel like eh."
1004528625.txt,"It was like I had - it just made me realized like how little I care about my dad in comparison to how much I care about my brother, and it made me feel like (pause) everything that I care about with my dad is just a reflection of like how it affects me. Like it's just I care."
1004528625.txt,"It's like I see all these feelings that I've had and that I've felt, and he's having them. And it's just like, and then you just know that feeling"
1004528625.txt,"Yeah of course it's because of a lot of the same feelings that I felt, and because of the same experiences and because of the same situation. And with my dad I feel like it's just all self-inflicted."
1004528625.txt,And with my dad I feel like it's just all self-inflicted. And maybe it's not.
1004528625.txt,"And so that makes me resentful of him and angry towards him, and it makes me also really scared for my brother. Like change it, change it, like I'm going to change it, don't you want to change it?"
1004528625.txt,"And I feel like no one understands like how much it consumes me. You know, like I feel like I was really reactive all weekend to Chris."
1004528625.txt,"You know, like I feel like I was really reactive all weekend to Chris. Not all weekend, like we had a really nice time, but I was on edge."
1004528625.txt,"I can't function in this way, that he just goes along, because he doesn't - like if he knew how much I like - how much it consumes my feelings towards my brothers, he would be like you're a little crazy, like that's a little bit intense. [00:37:16]</p> Because it's like, because I just know that nobody else that I am friends with has these feelings of like - like I feel like my brother's well-being consumes me more than like any other person's relationship with anybody."
1004565043.txt,and I just still get some sort of reward for going.</p> I'm just annoyed that Doreen is exerting this control and wants it all to be perfect for her.
1004565043.txt,My mom is demanding and I know that Doreen is going to be upset if I don't now because - but not because she likes me but because she wants to be in control.
1004565043.txt,Well it's not like I can call her up and be like hey Doreen will you be upset if I don't go to your bridal shower because I hate you?</p>
1004565043.txt,"Oh I'm still also angry at the fact that she's making me go to this bridal shower, making me become part of this party so that [inaudible at 00:38:50].</p>"
1004565043.txt,Well I'm angry at my parents too.</p>
1004565043.txt,"I've still been able to do stuff, like yesterday when I had my concert, beforehand when we were in the practice room, I was - pretty much whenever we weren't singing I was down on the floor because I was really tired."
1004565043.txt,I have not been panicking since that.</p>
1004565043.txt,"But at the same time there was a time yesterday, a time today that I was feeling a little bit depressed, not like super depressed and not like self-harm wanting..."
1004565043.txt,Maybe but I was feeling that way yesterday too and stuff so.
1004565043.txt,"If it were something nice it would make it feel fair because I do things for her and it's like oh get together with Grandma, do this, do that. It's not like she's asked me to do nothing."
1004565043.txt,"Well it's not like I can call her up and be like hey Doreen will you be upset if I don't go to your bridal shower because I hate you?</p> Yes, I mean the problem is there is no way to get confirmation.</p>"
1004565043.txt,She would get very upset and hiss and stuff. No one's going to believe that I got into a horrible accident in which I got turned into a cat.</p>
1004565043.txt,Then I would feel bad about it.</p> Even though she deserves it?</p> Even though I dislike her and she's done mean things to my friends?
1004565043.txt,and I don't feel like I should forgive her. It just - I would feel bad about being like
1004565043.txt,Add more guilt. Keep on telling me how she never asks me to do anything even though that's a lie.</p>
1004565043.txt,and I've been instead taking at night a Klonopin and that way the effects of the anti-anxiety stuff will last during the day. And I still don't have a problem during the night; the problem is every day since then I've been tired during the day.
1004565043.txt,"I've still been able to do stuff, like yesterday when I had my concert, beforehand when we were in the practice room, I was - pretty much whenever we weren't singing I was down on the floor because I was really tired. And...</p> I think it's from the Klonopin."
1004565043.txt,I mean I also - I guess I can wait and see if I still feel tired a few days later.</p> My panic is fine.
1004565043.txt,My panic is fine. I have not been panicking since that.</p>
1004565043.txt,"I have not been panicking since that.</p> But at the same time there was a time yesterday, a time today that I was feeling a little bit depressed, not like super depressed and not like self-harm wanting..."
1004565043.txt,"Maybe but I was feeling that way yesterday too and stuff so. I wasn't actively thinking about the shower, though."
1004687718.txt,"I feel kind of dizzy and out of it.</p> Withdrawal is not that much fun, as I have had occasion to learn because I cannot remember to refill it."
1004687718.txt,"When I am the one who brings it up it's much easier to feel like I am being selfish in that way or that I am being a drain on the other person, that I am exhausting them."
1004687718.txt,"Maybe because as soon as I feel better I forget what it's like to feel so bad.</p> (Pause, exhales) Umm, (pause)"
1004687718.txt,"I'm just scared that I don't have a job, I have an apartment, I told you about the apartment right?</p>"
1004687718.txt,"I don't (pause, crying) when I'm as upset as I am I don't know how to function."
1004687718.txt,"But mostly it feels like you know, I get up and start doing the things that I need to do because I have decided that it's time for me to stop being sad."
1004687718.txt,I mean maybe that is just a pattern that comes from my deciding not to be sad so much of the time.
1004687718.txt,(Pause) I feel like I'm not the person that they think they know anymore.
1004687718.txt,I just don't know what my life would look like if I didn't try to manage my feelings.
1004687718.txt,I mean I haven't ever had a life in which I didn't feel it was of utmost importance to manage my feelings pretty strictly.
1004687718.txt,"Part of this is from, you know if I dwell on feeling bad I feel worse."
1004687718.txt,"And there's so much what may or may not be crap about the power of positive thinking and just put good thoughts in your head and you'll feel better, and I don't know how to process that."
1004687718.txt,[00:41:34] (Pause) And (pause) I find that I can't deal with people who are sad all the time.
1004687718.txt,"I feel kind of dizzy and out of it.</p> Withdrawal is not that much fun, as I have had occasion to learn because I cannot remember to refill it. I really should renew my prescriptions to a pharmacy that's open all the time."
1004687718.txt,"Yeah, like feeling like people are going to be really bothered by me kind of, you know I do that thing where somebody tells a story and I'm like, oh! I have a story that's kind of like that"
1004687718.txt,"When I am the one who brings it up it's much easier to feel like I am being selfish in that way or that I am being a drain on the other person, that I am exhausting them. And part of it with my dad is he's constantly saying things like 'I don't want to pry."
1004687718.txt,"Which is really nice that he has that much respect for my emotional space, I recognize that I am very lucky in having my primary parent be that way, having enough friends with parents who don't understand the concept of space. But it's hard for me to say in a way that he will hear 'no you will never be prying on this subject."
1004687718.txt,"You know I still cut myself, still worried about suicide and have to cut myself to (groans). [00:13:01]</p> (Crying) I umm, it was I guess three to six days ago and for two nights in a row"
1004687718.txt,"it's one of those I (pause) have again this tension between not wanting to be doing this, wanting to stop, but also this is in a lot, you know this is better than the alternative in some ways, you know continuing to feel really bad and worrying about doing more damage to myself. [00:14:40] (Pause) And just wanting to have control, wanting to feel like I can do something that will make me feel better."
1004687718.txt,"and it feels like a dream in some ways. In that it's like everyone else is living in this different world, and I know they're not all actually living in a different world, I know that there's a lot of really sad people out there."
1004687718.txt,"But I kind of feel like I'm using different terminology to talk about what you've already talked about, if that makes sense.</p> (Both laugh) And this that like (pause), you know I think of every (pause) interpersonal interaction, every idea, every way of phrasing things, like it's all, it just (pause)."
1004687718.txt,"[00:31:29] And particularly with human emotions which have way too many variables to deal with, like I have to do (chuckles). Maybe you haven't figured out but (both laugh).</p> (Exhales) I don't know where I'm going with this."
1004687718.txt,I just feel like I couldn't keep up with my life if I (pause).</p> Yeah I'm pretty combative today.
1004687718.txt,I just feel like I'll lose people. (Pause) I feel like I'm not the person that they think they know anymore.
1004687718.txt,"(Pause) I feel like I'm not the person that they think they know anymore. And I don't have (pause, crying) and sometimes it still comes naturally to me to step up for the occasion, you know, to say 'okay I am meeting my friend and her boyfriend this morning, I am going to be cheerful'."
1004687718.txt,I just don't know what my life would look like if I didn't try to manage my feelings. I mean I haven't ever had a life in which I didn't feel it was of utmost importance to manage my feelings pretty strictly.
1004687718.txt,"Part of this is from, you know if I dwell on feeling bad I feel worse. And there's so much what may or may not be crap about the power of positive thinking and just put good thoughts in your head and you'll feel better, and I don't know how to process that."

1004478012.txt,I feel that it can be true.
1004478012.txt,"Yeah, and I feel like before, like, it was a little bit of like, I don't know if I want to say this or — but, like, he and I are comfortable talking."
1004478012.txt,"But once we talk (inaudible at 00:06:05) I feel like I'm really (inaudible at 00:06:06) or I can trust more and just that initial — I don't know if it's maybe I don't know how it's going to be received, and I'm still kind of like, pull back a little bit."
1004478012.txt,"I feel like it's getting better, but — or, like, he'll bring things up and I'll be, like, damn (inaudible at 00:06:41) to talk about it."
1004478012.txt,"Yeah, like, I feel more just like defeated, like, I feel like I take things, like, personally, but at that moment they're probably like just things that are coming out of your mouth, or that he's (inaudible at 00:09:13) in."
1004478012.txt,"I feel like I'm like, I'm answering all your questions and you're still not making any sense."
1004478012.txt,"I feel like he can be, like, a know-it-all sometimes and kind of like, why do you think you know it all?"
1004478012.txt,"but it can feel like that sometimes, and then I feel bad that he feels like that because I feel like my intention is not to come across that way."
1004478012.txt,"(inaudible at 00:12:59) or one that I don't know how to deal with at the moment, and then being upset and me feeling like have to make an answer or make a decision."
1004478012.txt,"So I feel like be in that position, feeling like I need to make a decision (inaudible at 00:13:23) what to do and then there's a lot of the discomfort that comes with it."
1004478012.txt,"But then I'm like, worried about conversations are going to go badly or if we're going to have a fight out of it, so that I don't bring it up because I don't want to ruin our weekend."
1004478012.txt,"Maybe I guess I'm — I understand that I guess I'm just sort of responding to, like, you feel like a fight is inevitable."
1004478012.txt,"And I don't know why I feel so strongly, like, about that, like, with him because I feel like he's very nice and, like, when you do talk with him, like, about a serious thing he's — like, we joke about it"
1004478012.txt,"And so I don't, you know — I feel like I'm just very different from that, but still not close, like hesitations."
1004478012.txt,"and then I get more — I feel like sad and, like, upset with myself when I become intolerant with myself because then I'm just really annoyed that I can't — like, it's not easy, but yeah, that I just can't make myself do it or like me knowing — well, not from experience but conversations with (inaudible at 00:17:10) usually go well and still, I just can't do it."
1004478012.txt,But I feel like that's not good
1004478012.txt,"Like, with my parents I completely feel that that scenario that you just kind of said is true, but with him, I feel like I can talk to him."
1004478012.txt,"But I feel like when I have, like, major emotions at stake and we're talking about them usually it is okay."
1004478012.txt,"And this is where I start to feel annoyed too because I feel like I want to have, like, an action plan."
1004478012.txt,"But I think I have a habit of, like, if I'm upset, like, I will just (inaudible at 00:24:01) shed light on the topic instead of kind of dealing with it."
1004478012.txt,"Because there are things I want to say and I'm just not saying it until — I feel like I'm waiting for, like, someone to give me, like, the green light to speak, or maybe that's not the (inaudible at 00:24:51)."
1004478012.txt,I feel like it's all me just not being able to talk.
1004478012.txt,It's not like once I talk that I feel like it's (inaudible at 00:24:59).
1004478012.txt,"And then if there are things that, like, he may not be upset about that I want to talk about, I'm not going to start bringing them up where they come up, like, of them either."
1004478012.txt,"Like, I never want to bring something up because it's little, and I probably should, but so then it's like, okay, this little thing upset me."
1004478012.txt,It's not that big of a deal even though it upset me a little bit
1004478012.txt,"yeah, that people may not even know I'm upset."
1004478012.txt,"Because if you are, like, upset, like — because I feel like when I leave conversations with my dad, I'm really, really upset."
1004478012.txt,"And I know I'm upset about or am upset about whatever we're having the conversation, but then I'm upset of how he, like, handled the conversation, or he made me feel about initiating the conversation, every other kind of low blow I guess that you threw in."
1004478012.txt,"and I feel like it's almost, like, too much credit, but I don't know if I'm — like, it upsets me that much that I feel that impacted by it, that my response is just, like, no, it can't be that."
1004528631.txt,The problem is I feel like I should have patience for her because she at least has an excuse that she's lost her short-term memory.
1004528631.txt,"oh, you know, surgery, blah, blah, blah, etc., and she can knit and play a guitar and stuff like that, and I was feeling oh God, like I'm the disabled kid who can knit."
1004528631.txt,"And I really don't want to be dieting 'cause I'm afraid to, it doesn't work, and so like..."
1004528631.txt,And I'm still like worried about the whole trial (ph) thing and stuff.
1004528631.txt,"And I actually today turned down a position, despite being worried about the job thing 'cause it was this thing I applied for way back, a document conservator contractor position."
1004528631.txt,Then I'll feel better about it and then it will just be...
1004528631.txt,and that's why I didn't feel bad about them.
1004528631.txt,"But I'm sort of afraid that if I do this, then I'll never actually do it... 'cause I'll just like"
1004528631.txt,[00:36:05]</p> Except that I'm sort of afraid that then I'll just get lazy and never do it.
1004528631.txt,"And that would be sad about never even doing it, but not sad enough that I actually do it."
1004528631.txt,"It is like this huge flat thingy, which was fine when I was like in the old place, but I feel like it takes up a lot of space."
1004528631.txt,"But I didn't really get a chance to look at it since – when I was there over Shabbat and when I came back from Israel 'cause when I came back from Israel, I was all stressed out about having to get back so like I wasn't in a position to look at the dresser."
1004528631.txt,"I mean no one was mean, but there are some points where some people said some things that like made me feel really uncomfortable. Just like talking about how clearly everyone believes that Obama is a putz, or stuff like that, or someone who had then actually said back because the one person was actually like ""No, I actually like Obama,"" and having one (inaudible at 00:00:46), and blah, blah, blah."
1004528631.txt,"And it's just – they're sad. Also, like I was getting my family – I don't know that I can do another family vacation without outside support."
1004528631.txt,"And I feel bad that I have no patience for her, but she is losing her memory and she'll – for example, she was going to – she went up to the bathroom, and she had left her purse with dad, and then she sort of started freaking out. Actually, I think even then, one time mom asked dad, ""Oh, is she going to remember that you have her purse?"""
1004528631.txt,"oh, you know, surgery, blah, blah, blah, etc., and she can knit and play a guitar and stuff like that, and I was feeling oh God, like I'm the disabled kid who can knit. Isn't that so amazing?"
1004528631.txt,"yeah, it felt like everyone else in the world could do cartwheels but me. And flex arm hanging, it was just – I always like – I mean why would I even bother with the stupid presidential physical fitness test?"

1004528631.txt,"[00:16:58]</p> I don't need my degree to do that, and it seems kind of mind numbing and stuff. Like I'm okay with scanning things if it's like part of my job.</p> Yeah.</p>"
1004528631.txt,"Like I think I made the right decision, especially if I've turned down other job that paid more and was less monotonous than this and had slightly less of a communal death.</p> Yeah, if it were like less of a commute and better paying and not interesting, I could do it."
1004528631.txt,"I need to move, but I need to move, but I don't have it written down. I need to write cover letters, but it – those are like – okay, so moving now I can break it down to different – different tasks, but as of now, it's one task, so it didn't break down because it's obvious and the same with the cover letters.</p>"
1004528631.txt,"But I'm sort of afraid that if I do this, then I'll never actually do it... 'cause I'll just like oh, but I want my room to be unpacked and everything to be..."

1004513658.txt,"Yes, I feel like $6.</p> Well going out for dessert instead of a meal wouldn't be enough for him, though he doesn't usually go out for desserts."
1004513658.txt,I don't know how they feel about if I'm like paying multiple times a week to go out to eat like how they would feel about that. I think to them - you know if I'm paying to go out to eat once a week that's fine.
1004513658.txt,"I'm just afraid that their discretionary flex budget would be like okay on your money how are your little [inaudible at 00:14:14], you shouldn't be spending more than that on like-item things.</p> They're happy to support me with rent and items related to my healthcare and food, but I'm pretty sure it's food within reason"
1004513658.txt,"The two are related and I've felt like a failure for breaking, not breaking the little needle but ordering the wrong size when I could have prevented it and now I have to pay extra money for this mistake. So it's I don't have a job and the last month I have not done anything towards looking for a job or at least in the way of anything more than reading job ads."
1004513658.txt,And this week it was all packing for Israel and originally panicking about the fact that I had to move my stuff from one room to the other before I went to Israel. And then I talked to Aaron yesterday and he was - because no one's coming in on - like they want to redo the floors in my room since when we redid the floors on that side of the house we didn't do my room because it wasn't like I really had somewhere else that I could move my stuff to
1004513658.txt,No I'm not feeling like a failure for breaking the needles. I'm feeling like a failure for ordering the incorrect needles when I could've double-checked it.</p>
1004513658.txt,I'm feeling like a failure for ordering the incorrect needles when I could've double-checked it.</p> It was a mistake that I didn't need to make.</p>
1004513658.txt,Once it becomes May I won't even have that for a while because the kitchen closes down in the summer. So it's not even a full - it's not even a job that I have all year around.
1004513658.txt,"Now I'm thinking because I've been feeling so guilty about not having, making money, maybe I should do that but then I wouldn't be volunteering or getting anything in my field."
1004513658.txt,"I feel the littler the kids probably the more professional you have to be. Like if you're taking care of babies, they're going to want people who have experience taking care of babies since babies are really, really fragile."
1004513658.txt,But I don't feel like I'm doing anything. Like currently it's not like I'm doing anything useful or right or anything that is helpful in any way.
1004513658.txt,"So I think I have a right to feel like a failure because, you know, with all my talents it doesn't get me anything.</p> Accuracy and/or punishing myself because I think I deserve to be punished for -</p> It's not what I want but it's what I deserve and/or less capable of actual thought right now."
1004513658.txt,"Like, on Tuesday I was - there was a point where I was feeling like hurting myself. Obviously I knew that I wasn't going to do anything about it"
1004513658.txt,"but I was feeling like hurting myself and I'm like, here I am. I'm like wasting all these resources of my parents and/or the universe if I'm not a productive member of society."
1004513658.txt,"oh yes, look at my LinkedIn profile and feel free to ask me about any of those contacts. And I'm like"
1004513658.txt,"and then I could - like if I was going to be second Masters in something useful but -</p> It might be eventually, but eventually isn't going to make me feel better now about spending all this money going out to eat that I shouldn't and I don't feel in control of that.</p>"
1004513658.txt,and I don't feel in control of that.</p> I'll convince others if you think that's going make it less so.</p>
1004798837.txt,"I was feeling like it was intentionally directed at me, and I'm sure it was to some extent"
1004798837.txt,I was just feeling really sad and miserable.
1004798837.txt,"I just wanted to talk to him, but was feeling conflicted."
1004798837.txt,"He comes over to me, moves seats and drunkenly sits down next to me kind of brushing me."
1004798837.txt,and I had already been feeling shitty.
1004798837.txt,"He was really upset and he was like, ""Well I don't want to do this anymore then, because it's just too hard."""
1004798837.txt,He felt I wasn't holding up my end of the bargain in the sense of having made the decision together that we are going to try to work on things and see if we can make this work.
1004798837.txt,I feel confused like what it was and confused if he still has chummy relationships with girls and who they are and if this is what it is.
1004798837.txt,"I'm not really sure what it would solve for me, but I guess it just feels like there was this whole thing that I was very directly involved in that I don't have any grasp on what actually happened, and that upsets me."
1004798837.txt,"I'm just nervous about how that's going to go and overall, if he's trustworthy."
1004798837.txt,I think it's more like I am almost feeling internal pressure to figure this out and move on in whatever direction it's going to be.
1004798837.txt,So I sit down
1004798837.txt,I am worried about all of this stuff.
1004798837.txt,"""I like the feeling,"" and he's like, ""I feel like one should feel that way whether they're in a relationship or not."""
1004798837.txt,"I think his feelings were a little bit hurt, but he took it like a man for once."
1004798837.txt,"and I was miserably sad, on the verge of tears, this friend of Franklin's who we've known since he was little—I guess their families grew up together—this girl, she was there at the bar and she was like, ""Listen."""
1004798837.txt,It's not the girls I'm worried about; it's him.
1004798837.txt,"Right now?"" I had already been feeling miserable the whole night"
1004798837.txt,"and I got really angry. I didn't have my car and my friend's boyfriend was designated driver, and so he took us to get pizza and that was fine."
1004798837.txt,"I was just feeling really sad and miserable. I just wanted to talk to him, but was feeling conflicted."
1004798837.txt,"I just wanted to talk to him, but was feeling conflicted. So I was even miserable at this club and I'm not really a huge fan of clubs to begin with anymore."
1004798837.txt,"He comes over to me, moves seats and drunkenly sits down next to me kind of brushing me. I was like, ""Okay."""
1004798837.txt,So then we talked and it got a little heated and turned into a whole you stopped talking to me without saying why and I felt abandoned. I was starting to feel things towards you that I didn't want to feel.
1004798837.txt,"I tried to explain that I just feel like trying to take a break, like I just felt like I needed a little space; and this and that. He was really upset and he was like, ""Well I don't want to do this anymore then, because it's just too hard."""
1004798837.txt,"He was really upset and he was like, ""Well I don't want to do this anymore then, because it's just too hard."" I was like, ""Okay, again you're threatening to break up with me."
1004798837.txt,"He got really upset that I used the word ""bully"" or said it in the heat of the moment. I was like, ""Okay, I'm sorry, but I need to be able to tell you things without it getting to the point where I'm blurting it out."""
1004798837.txt,He said he would like to see a couple of therapists and he was feeling frustrated. He felt I wasn't holding up my end of the bargain in the sense of having made the decision together that we are going to try to work on things and see if we can make this work.
1004798837.txt,"He felt I wasn't holding up my end of the bargain in the sense of having made the decision together that we are going to try to work on things and see if we can make this work. I was like, ""It was because I wasn't really seeing as much as I had hoped in terms of things you were doing."
1004798837.txt,"[00:06:40] That made him upset, but fine. I would like to hold up my end of bargain, I just needed him to show me a little bit of enthusiasm."
1004798837.txt,"I think we might go out tonight or Sunday, but I still have the feelings like being unsure, obviously, and not really knowing. In our conversation he, too, finally for once instead of being like, ""I hate it when you say, 'What if we don't work out?'"" but finally for once he was like, ""If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but if we're going to try, let's try."""
1003269452.txt,It wasn't like I was completely free of all anxiety and worry
1003269452.txt,I was really nervous.
1003269452.txt,I'm always worried about these things.</p> Right.</p> Right.</p>
1003269452.txt,"I was like, 'I'm still worrying, I'm still crazy, I'm (overlapping at 0:25:59)</p>"
1003269452.txt,"It is for sure not as intense as the way I feel when it is a personal relationship, but it is still a little bit of anxiety."
1003269452.txt,I think it is a lot of not making decisions in life because I'm afraid it will be the wrong decision.
1003269452.txt,"It is for certain … in certain ways it is also like you don't have to be a genius to become a teacher, and I feel like I'm a really smart person"
1003269452.txt,"I don't know how you feel about Northwest.</p> It is kind of downtown, whatever."
1003269452.txt,I can't really recognize his annoyance face and his angry face and differentiate. But I think it has been helping me deal with those things too because I didn't get as crazy as I feel like I would have before.
1003269452.txt,"Well the thing is, it is usually the strongest is always anxiety. But there is a little twinge of the other, so I just added them."
1003269452.txt,That the way I feel about how other people feel about me and view me. I think it is more that.
1003269452.txt,I'm always worried about these things.</p> Right.</p> Right.</p> That is very illogical.
1003269452.txt,"I feel that too. When it doesn't happen it's like, but…but…, and I don't know how to function because I want it to happen the way I want it."
1003269452.txt,"well certainly if I'm not being obsessive and worrying over things. Because the truth is, it's obvious when I'm in that state, even if I don't tell people."
1003269452.txt,"I was like, 'I'm still worrying, I'm still crazy, I'm (overlapping at 0:25:59)</p> And I was looking at the phone."
1003269452.txt,"It is for sure not as intense as the way I feel when it is a personal relationship, but it is still a little bit of anxiety. Like this isn't going to work out."
1003269452.txt,"But it doesn't make me stop worrying about it, which is unfortunate because …</p> That is true.</p> Exactly.</p>"
1003269452.txt,"And teaching for many reasons is looked down upon. It is for certain … in certain ways it is also like you don't have to be a genius to become a teacher, and I feel like I'm a really smart person"
1003269452.txt,"It is for certain … in certain ways it is also like you don't have to be a genius to become a teacher, and I feel like I'm a really smart person and I could probably get a degree that is a lot more prestigious than teaching."
1003269452.txt,And then I get down on myself because of that. It's like well I'm not – I can't think of the word.
1004513664.txt,"I feel like I'm just like really confused of the situation about what's going on, like, (pause) just being involved in a relationship with house, kids, you know just everyday life just because I don't want to make the wrong decisions."
1004513664.txt,"but I want to make the right decisions that I feel are, you know not going to lead them the path that I was at."
1004513664.txt,"Where they feel like, ""Okay, that was good for now, but if I stay on him, you know in a couple of weeks, couple of months I'm going to get it."""
1004513664.txt,"Because right now I'm at a stand still because I feel like, you know on financial mountain I'm still at the base."
1004513664.txt,"And (pause) it's new to me too because, you know I kind of ... this is what I'm control of, this is what I can control and I feel I have no control over it."
1004513664.txt,And now I completely feel like my hands have slipped and I'm holding on by like two fingers.
1004513664.txt,I feel like you know my life is controlled by other people.
1004513664.txt,And now I guess I'm scared of their reactions.
1004513664.txt,I'm scared of what they're going to think of me because I want to do the right thing.
1004513664.txt,"But there's that fear of me, you know stepping out on the ledge without anyone holding my hand or crossing the street without anyone holding my hand."
1004513664.txt,and I kind of feel like I'm an addict for my parents.</p> You know?
1004513664.txt,you know it ... thinking back on it I kind of am upset because I mean I wasn't going to tell them that I was doing drugs.
1004513664.txt,It's kind of like we talked about you know last week is how I feel indebted to them.
1004513664.txt,Is where people will feel that way towards me.
1004513664.txt,You know maybe it's just because I am upset at the fact that I didn't get to spend as much quality time with my dad as I wanted to.</p>
1004513664.txt,"And the more and more that I just play it off, you know not do it, the more and more anxious I get about it because I'm kindly like in the same boat as her. I want it sooner rather than later but I also want to have an income coming in where I'm not going to be too far behind when I have a wedding to pay for, when I have a child to pay for, when I have a house to pay for, when I have all of this stuff just coming on top.</p> Because I do not know how to be that person."
1004513664.txt,"but I want to make the right decisions that I feel are, you know not going to lead them the path that I was at. Where they feel like, ""Okay, that was good for now, but if I stay on him, you know in a couple of weeks, couple of months I'm going to get it."""
1004513664.txt,"Where they feel like, ""Okay, that was good for now, but if I stay on him, you know in a couple of weeks, couple of months I'm going to get it."" Because that's kind of like what I did, in a way."
1004513664.txt,I am you know taking other time and she feels I don't have anytime for her. And I guess I'm confused at the point.
1004513664.txt,But I told her how; you know I felt betrayed by her. And I don't know if that was the right thing to say to her at the time
1004513664.txt,but I just felt now that we were opening up more and we were communicating more that I did need to tell her how I felt.</p>
1004513664.txt,"Because I do feel ... and I don't if it's just me or if it's us, you know from everybody I talk to because I get it, you know my parents, I get it from her, I get it from her mother. You know I kind of feel like I'm getting a lot pressure on me to be engaged, to start a family, to get married and to do all this stuff."
1004513664.txt,"You know I kind of feel like I'm getting a lot pressure on me to be engaged, to start a family, to get married and to do all this stuff. Even my great aunts and uncles are the same way."
1004513664.txt,"And (pause) it's new to me too because, you know I kind of ... this is what I'm control of, this is what I can control and I feel I have no control over it. And that's what you know it irritates me."
1004513664.txt,"And now I completely feel like my hands have slipped and I'm holding on by like two fingers. Because everybody else is putting in, everybody else is throwing their two cents in."
1004513664.txt,Because reactionary I just do something to put people in their place and then worry about it. Now I'm just taking in all this information and thinking about every aspect of it and when I think about every aspect well then my big decision-making comes in again
1004513664.txt,And now I guess I'm scared of their reactions. I'm scared of what they're going to think of me because I want to do the right thing.
1004513664.txt,"But there's that fear of me, you know stepping out on the ledge without anyone holding my hand or crossing the street without anyone holding my hand. And am I going to be able to really do it, you know?"
1004513664.txt,I never stole from any of my family members but you know I felt bad in college when I'd blow through all my money. You know I'd work and it would be gone.
1004513664.txt,you know it ... thinking back on it I kind of am upset because I mean I wasn't going to tell them that I was doing drugs. But I feel bad in the sense that I lied to them and they were feeding my addiction.</p>
1004798823.txt,And I haven't been so where as I was yesterday that there was a big anxiety comes on.
1004798823.txt,I think most of it is anxiety symptoms.</p>
1004798823.txt,"But if I'm hungry at home, I never feel anxious."
1004798823.txt,"But it was just the thing that was in my head at the time of like, I feel bad, but I can't get up. </p"
1004798823.txt,"Yeah, Jeremy's pretty good about giving me positive feedback at rehearsal when he feels there is something positive."
1004798823.txt,and I don't know how the anxiety about fainting got so intense so quickly. So it's a classic like fainting setup.
1004798823.txt,And I haven't been so where as I was yesterday that there was a big anxiety comes on. But it was really clear.
1004798823.txt,"I meant my blood pressure might have dropped a little bit...and my blood sugar, but there was nothing really drastic physically that caused this anxiety. It was like the anxiety about it caused some pretty strong physical sensations."
1004798823.txt,"I think most of it is anxiety symptoms.</p> I think there is the knowledge that I'm hungry, the knowledge that I'm tired, and the knowledge that I'm in this big seminar in the front row."
1004798823.txt,"And like the feeling of being tired and hungry, but I was tired and hungry for the first 20 minutes of the talk and didn't...like it was sort of just like this lapse in concentration. My like mind darted to; oh this is sort of like the perfect storm for fainting."
1004798823.txt,"it's almost like the rehearsals aren't so anxiety provoking that I don't care that much about sounding bad. And if they were, I probably wouldn't do it anymore."
1004687650.txt,"I'm not quite sure what it is, but I worry that I have another food allergy which would be a huge hassle cuz I seem to get more tired when I eat or drink alcohol."
1004687650.txt,"and I like shooed her away cuz I was worried she might bite it, and..."
1004687650.txt,"Um, and then it like ran away again, and then I finally managed to catch it with my hands and I was really afraid it was going to bite my hands."
1004687650.txt,"But even still feeling sort of obligated to watch it cuz like, you know, I couldn't let it starve...much like the hamster (laughs)."
1004687650.txt,Feeling like I was like a strange child and sort of my past self a little bit and this doll.
1004687650.txt,"I mean writing really puts me in touch I think with a lot of different like layers of my experience and ya know I know I feel like I'm in touch with like a deeper more whole self, like on a regular basis when I'm writing regularly..."
1004687650.txt,"And when I was at the retreat and writing a lot here in the week after...</p> ...like I didn't really feel like there was some mechanism that like this other thing that was trying to push an agenda in mysterious ways that I couldn't fathom like...and it was, ya know, when I was like working with the textbook writing, um, I didn't feel that as much, but then at The retreat like I really felt pretty normal again."
1004687650.txt,everyone's mind feels like this and I'm just really bad at getting past it.
1004687650.txt,And I could understand everything I was feeling.
1004687650.txt,I have to have more than a week of feeling (inaudible at 00:02:21].9). Again I don't know how much of it is just some physical thing that I haven't figured out yet.
1004687650.txt,"I guess it's funny because ya know when I was starting to feel worse and worse last time like, it was like I'm like I wasn't sure how much of it was physical and how much of it was mental and you know I still don't really know because just so many different things are going on and like the proportions of it are sort of (inaudible at 00:03:15].1) serious."
1004687650.txt,and I like slammed the box down and then I freaked out because I was like what if I slammed the center line on top of the hamster and like I could have like just killed my hamster.
1004687650.txt,but at that point I felt really shitty cuz like I had (inaudible at 00:06:34].3) it's life.
1004687650.txt,"So it like laid down in the middle of one of those doors and like played dead really convincingly and I recognized that it was playing dead but I was sort of like fascinated by why I thought that I was a good idea, and like my dog that I had as a child came over and started sniffing"
1004687650.txt,"and I like shooed her away cuz I was worried she might bite it, and... and I realized it would be like a really good time to catch the hamster since it was like immobile"
1004687650.txt,"Um, and just like the sensation of feeling (A) like sorry for the hamster and like worrying that it would starve if it just ran loose in the house, so feeling like I ought to catch it but also feeling very bad about catching it and putting it in a small house.</p> Um, and just being alarmed at like the person that made me as I was running around trying to catch it."
1004687650.txt,"and since I was a child the starfish had grown extremely large and more like fast and flexible and they could also live out of the water, so there were trees full of starfish, really large starfish, and um I started to get nervous because we were in a convertible and we couldn't close the top and the starfish in the trees were sort of threatening...</p> ...and they were starting to sort of like wave their arms and show interest in us, and it seems that one of them communicated to me somehow through just a telepathic message that it like was thinking about, ya know, jumping into the car and like covering my face and like eating me and suffocating me, which was pretty terrifying.</p> And at that point like the road looked like it might be in danger of going into the water or something"
1004687650.txt,and I had the hair down to my waist so I didn't always know what I was doing and it was getting in the candles (laughs) at that time.
1004687650.txt,"Feeling like I was like a strange child and sort of my past self a little bit and this doll. Um, and so during the mission we were escaping from alien forces that were trying to kill us all (laughs)...</p> ...and we had found like this small like cluster of humans who were living in like a science experiment facility of some sort and they could lock themselves underground and be safe from the invading forces and um, so we got to their compound."
1004687650.txt,I mean I do worry about it and um I feel like even sort of bad worrying about it because it seems like worrying about it is almost like inviting it back.
1004687650.txt,"But I really hope that without sort of the Wellbutrin to destabilize things and give it like an entrée into...</p> ...my nervous system, without like the birth control it's just like screwing up my hormones.</p> But everything would be more stable and not so easy to just unsettle um for very small reasons like taking a week off from fiction writing which doesn't seem like a change still (laughs).</p>"
1004687650.txt,"And when I was at the retreat and writing a lot here in the week after...</p> ...like I didn't really feel like there was some mechanism that like this other thing that was trying to push an agenda in mysterious ways that I couldn't fathom like...and it was, ya know, when I was like working with the textbook writing, um, I didn't feel that as much, but then at The retreat like I really felt pretty normal again. Um, and ya know it really would be nice to think that everything is totally like reintegrated and stable"
1004687644.txt,I felt like I couldn't cope with doing anything.
1004687644.txt,"Usually I just fall asleep or usually I'm so upset that I either just sort of lie still and stare at the ceiling, or I fall asleep."
1004687644.txt,"I thought it was is that how it feels, really different from sort of trying to avoid like being upset?"
1004687644.txt,but I feel like I kind of know that I'm still upset.
1004687644.txt,"Like no, actually I'm not upset or (inaudible at 00:07:01].2) other things."
1004687644.txt,Like it made it easier to sort of like disconnect from how I felt and just stay disconnected from my (inaudible [00:08:16].7).
1004687644.txt,"Um, though sometimes when I feel really disconnected from my body or from how I feel it's usually not super....like it doesn't last a very long time."
1004687644.txt,"Um, and I think that's one of the things that was really upsetting (inaudible at 00:10:35].0) is that like how I might feel about this, whether I might feel kind of out of it or I might feel sad or upset or angry."
1004687644.txt,I mean I feel like (pause) (inaudible at 00:22:25].7) that I say I'm feeling X and the next question will be but why?
1004687644.txt,"Although she would be very emotional, she didn't like me to be."
1004687644.txt,"I was upset or angry she would often like kind of one-up me on it or like well, you being upset made me upset, or you saying that has just triggered a flashback, or you so...or like we couldn't talk because I was being too angry or too aggressive or too violent or whatever, so tried to talk to her."
1004687644.txt,and I was really upset about something that her upset mattered more or was more (sighs)

1004687644.txt,"Um, I think that's one of the things that can make me feel stressed out doing therapy more frequently because it feels like is this the..."
1004687644.txt,I mean I think one of the things about being explicit about how I feel is that (sighs) like I'm scared that someone will...I'm scared things (inaudible at 00:34:48].1) or shot down or (sighs) like having someone (inaudible at 00:34:53].7) talking to you like focus on like something that's not important or like not really relevant to what I'm talking about.
1004687644.txt,The part that I care about is the part where I was really scared.
1004687644.txt,I was really angry.
1004687644.txt,"Um, and I think that (sighs)...I think this is where I feel more (inaudible at 00:37:31].7) or also this is where I particularly want to like describe or show not tell because..."
1004687644.txt,I mean it's not like I feel like I can't stop reframing things.
1004687644.txt,I always have to go down to the basement. It'll take you down to the basement but won't let you out on the first floor without a code.
1004687644.txt,and I felt like super stressed and just like I don't know I couldn't... I felt like I couldn't cope with doing anything.
1004687644.txt,"I felt like I couldn't cope with doing anything. So I did what I usually don't do at work, which is I took a Valium to see if that would like ease everything out...which it did."
1004687644.txt,"Um, really, really I felt like probably disconnected from like emotions and feelings for the rest of the day. Which, I mean, I'm sort of attributing to Valium but it might just have been me (inaudible at 00:03:33].2)."
1004687644.txt,"I don't really feel like eating cuz I was watching TV and I was, (inaudible at 00:04:09].0)"
1004687644.txt,"Um, or that I haven't wanted to make a decision about what to eat, that I don't feel very hungry. Which is also really weird."
1004687644.txt,"Um, and I've been talking to my friends about sort of avoiding and repressing difficult emotions cuz you didn't want to have them. Um, and I was like well,"
1004687644.txt,but I feel like I kind of know that I'm still upset. Like even if I'm sort of busy.
1004687644.txt,"Like no, actually I'm not upset or (inaudible at 00:07:01].2) other things. Like I still knew that something was going on."
1004687644.txt,"Um, and also like not how I felt taking any other psychiatric medication. And thought this was sort of really divorced."
1004687644.txt,"Like it made it easier to sort of like disconnect from how I felt and just stay disconnected from my (inaudible [00:08:16].7). Um, though sometimes when I feel really disconnected from my body or from how I feel it's usually not super....like it doesn't last a very long time."
1004687678.txt,So speaking of finance for really good things—I wanted to talk to you about something that I'm really frustrated about and I'm trying to figure out exactly how it goes off this.</p>
1004687678.txt,"But this whole thing kind of let down because I meddle—I try not to meddle a whole lot with this whole thing, and I mentioned the fact that—to him that, ""You know, whenever your mom—like, whenever you tell your mom that you've been depressed, which you—it takes you a long time to actually say this, she freaks out and gets off the phone."
1004687678.txt,"And I said, ""Well, you know, she can either talk to friends and find out what depressed people want to hear when they say they're depressed, or she can freaking Google it."""
1004687678.txt,"I'm sure, if you put in ""what to say to a friend or family member that is depressed,"" she will probably get more than one result."

1004687678.txt,"I don't—it is not even just like me being worried about redemption; I mean, it is beyond that."
1004687678.txt,"And so, I guess, what I probably feel like I want to do is, if I want to have a relationship, maybe find an intermediary to find out if it is OK."
1004687678.txt,"Because I really feel like, me even indirectly—and it is not like a, ""I'm afraid to talk to her."""
1004687678.txt,"I mean, I am afraid to talk to her, but I don't ever get anything back so it is like—it is just setting myself up for not hearing anything."
1004687678.txt,"Like, Dave and I, when we were about 18, we were listening to his little brother, who was like maybe 12 or 13 at the time, calling his sister [his sister or somebody] (ph) and they were screening the phone calls, and it was him, and they wouldn't answer 'cause they just didn't feel up to talking to him. Now, this was blatantly obvious to Dave and I, that, from now on, that if we call and we don't reach somebody, there's a chance that we're being screened, as well."
1004687678.txt,"And I said, ""Well, you know, she can either talk to friends and find out what depressed people want to hear when they say they're depressed, or she can freaking Google it.""

1004687678.txt,"I don't know what to say, and whatever I say, it feels like fake stuff."" And then she sort of threw her father under the bus for this, like saying that—like, I'd never really feel comfortable saying 'I love you' 'cause it sounds so fake—you know, 'cause her father never said it, but yet, you know, this and that, and so it was passed on to her."

1004687678.txt,"but you know all this stuff—my Aunt, who is still—I feel very close with, actually. Um, but the thing is, is that, even when they didn't get along, I spent a lot of time talking to my aunt."

1000060940.txt,I'm so anxious to get out of there
1000060940.txt,On the way to work I was driving along with Josh and he's nigh on impossible to wake up so we'd taken off right down the block here and gotten to the corner of 65th and Sweeney Ave
1000060940.txt,but it's like I feel like I have enough of the intention and the commitment and the ambition to start with whatever I'm doing now and continue without falling back into not doing anything or falling back into doing something I don't want to do or something like that.

1000060940.txt,you know I didn't see them for a week on in and when I did they had dark lines down to their chin but I realized what was going on then
1000060940.txt,On the way to work I was driving along with Josh and he's nigh on impossible to wake up so we'd taken off right down the block here and gotten to the corner of 65th and Sweeney Ave I guess it was.

1004600918.txt,so I'm frustrated.
1004600918.txt,I was a little nervous to bring it up to Chris because we talked about it forever ago like the fact that we wanted to go see somebody before we had a baby.
1004600918.txt,but I feel like it's a similar thing like you shouldn't want to fix yourself just because I want you to fix yourself.
1004600918.txt,(Pause) I didn't feel that way about my cousin Jodie who's a year older than me and she's on her second baby now.
1004600918.txt,"She had her first baby before I was even engaged and she was engaged and that, and so it didn't feel like I was on that level"
1004600918.txt,so I'm frustrated. It's also a little complicated just because of our insurance and sudden change.
1004600918.txt,"I was a little nervous to bring it up to Chris because we talked about it forever ago like the fact that we wanted to go see somebody before we had a baby. And I wasn't sure how he was going to react, what he was going to say, and the thing that I remembered was that..."
1004600918.txt,I think if it was something that it was clear that I really wanted but I feel the same way with him as I feel about every other person in my life like speaking for addicts I guess. I know Chris is not an addict
1004600918.txt,but I feel like it's a similar thing like you shouldn't want to fix yourself just because I want you to fix yourself. [00:13:23]</p> But neither of those things the person can control.
1004600918.txt,I felt great about myself. But it was motivated out of Emma saying that...
1004600918.txt,But keeping it to myself I feel better inside. I guess I just try to suppress that need to (pause) say something to her or to other people.
1004600918.txt,Because the only place it gets is getting the other person's feelings hurt. And I guess that's kind of what Emma did.
1004600918.txt,"She was kind of hurting my feelings. I felt like I was being insulted a little bit, and I kind of wanted to like—I don't know—like get a dig back"

1004600918.txt,"I was happy for her, and I didn't have these same feelings even though I'm closer to her than I am to this particular cousin. And even this baby that she's pregnant with now I didn't feel that way, and I think maybe it's because of her circumstances in life."
1004600918.txt,I guess I just don't feel competitive with her I guess is what it comes down to at the end if I'm being totally honest. [00:42:19]</p> Because I guess they don't have things that I'm envious of like I wouldn't want to be living in my mom's condo.
1004564995.txt,"I, uh, can't stop worrying about money even though I should not be worrying about money, but I kind of always worry about money."

1004564981.txt,Because I would sit down and I would not be able to get back up from it.
1004564981.txt,It's like sometimes when I let myself get to that point where I'm just like I feel like I should warn people before they date him that sometimes he hits people.
1004564981.txt,And it makes me so angry that there is nothing that can make me want her approval and (inaudible at 00:34:22).
1004564981.txt,"I'm the kind of person, by the way, who has gone to massage therapy and has been stressed out because of the fact that I'm not relaxing enough."
1004564981.txt,"And I've given a lot of thought as to why I feel that way about that. And I think the big thing is, is that I by nature have had that experience in my life more than a few times like as in people have decided I was doing something - that I had a lot of less than kind (pause) intentions when I've not."
1004564981.txt,And I probably will actually ask him but that kind of stuff I have no fear about at all. Vaguely famous author but who I have a relationship (inaudible at 00:09:37) with that I can say hey I would love to be able to try and see if we could do some validation on a logic based scale.
1004564981.txt,Because I would sit down and I would not be able to get back up from it. I'd get stuck in the loop of whatever it is.
1004564981.txt,oh my God I'm going to go lay down and die kind of behavior that can drive me up the wall. Sometimes it's amusing because they'll say things like I am literally dying over here
1004564981.txt,And it makes me so angry that there is nothing that can make me want her approval and (inaudible at 00:34:22). Which is bad.
1000133854.txt,and it just seemed it kind of blew the whole (chuckling) thing because I was just worrying about it.
1000133854.txt,well it was me because I was worrying about it you know.
1000133854.txt,"But that's, you know it was the only thing that was rotten about the whole thing was me worrying about it."
1000133854.txt,"But that really kind of you know just, it was disappointing (chuckling) to me.</p> That I was worrying, you know that I was so you know upset about it."
1000133854.txt,"but I would feel, you know I wouldn't, no, I would feel kind of like [overlapping voices]</p> ...hat was the ultimate thing, yeah.</p>"
1000133854.txt,"Yeah, if I'm — and I'd be worried about the whole thing and then [overlapping voices]</p>"
1000133854.txt,"I mean as far as them doing something about it, maybe they need a push, too (chuckling).</p> Which is sad but (chuckling) there's always shock treatments (chuckling)."
1000133854.txt,"Yeah, I was you know, it was kind of like a down feeling you know (chuckling), a down feeling (chuckling)."
1000133854.txt,"And it was probably the, the only reason I didn't was fear, you know become involved in it,"
1000133854.txt,"So it worried me (chuckling). [0:02:52.4]</p> That, that I you know like I, you know like I, you know a couple of times you know I felt an erection coming on but then I thought about it, the minute I thought about it (snapping fingers) that was it"
1000133854.txt,"Yeah, worried about things, yeah, worried about things. But that really kind of you know just, it was disappointing (chuckling) to me.</p> That I was worrying, you know that I was so you know upset about it."
1000133854.txt,"But I guess, like you said, it's being answered (ph), you know it's not going to come instantaneously.</p> ...and you are going to have worries, you are going to have times that you're going to worry about it.</p> Yeah, that's true.</p>"
1000133854.txt,"Yeah, I was you know, it was kind of like a down feeling you know (chuckling), a down feeling (chuckling). I meant to ask her this morning if she was on her way to the post office."
1000133854.txt,"well she took this girl down to the counselor. And I thought to myself, God if I was in high school, if I only, if I only would've gone to that counselor you know and really had seen you know."
1000133854.txt,"[Christ's name, there'd just be] (ph), there'd be blood up and down the hallway (chuckling) and everything else, it was really quite a school, really quite a school. But the thing that after I you know was thinking about it, I thought you know, if you really did something within four years you could've really made it, make it worthwhile."
1000133854.txt,"In fact, this one girl, you know she came up to Viv, she says ""I can't even tell you what they called me"", you know she had to write it down, they called me a white honky you know and just it's really sad, really sad."
1000133854.txt,"and just it's really sad, really sad. In fact, I wondered and you know I sense that you know like that so something was,"
1000133840.txt,and then I sat down and looked -</p> Of August.
1000133840.txt,Then I sat down and looked at where we were going and tried to figure out time wise and figured that I'd really be cutting myself if I tried to make it back by the first
1000133840.txt,I don't think I'm at point where I can deal with it and be comfortable about it and feel completely good about it.
1000133840.txt,"And I guess depending on what it does to you psychologically, but I really feel as though that was -</p> No."
1000133840.txt,It's like I feel very much the same as I felt before.
1000133840.txt,I'm almost afraid it - I want to talk about it so bad.</p>
1000133840.txt,I guess what I feel good about is - I don't if I'd have done this a while back.
1000133840.txt,but I felt like it was an uncomfortable situation.
1000133840.txt,And I felt like I was able to confront her with it and feel okay about it and be able to leave without-</p>
1000133840.txt,I wonder if everyone was angry with us for taking off.
1000133840.txt,And I feel like all I'm really there for is to mechanically pack up and leave.</p>
1000133840.txt,"In the last year, we've lost some of the close touches that we have had and so I don't feel as though I'm really leaving them at all.</p> Because that's the most hurtful kind of separation is a gradual kind of thing.</p> Uh-hmm."
1000133840.txt,[Just bemoaning the fact that other people close to you are-] (ph) I kind of feel like that's what having kept in touch with some people I went to college with by their being here for a short period of time on and off has somewhat kept me from that moving on while I've been in Chicago.
1000133840.txt,I'm just not very anxious about it.
1000133840.txt,And sitting down to write that letter I'd been working up to doing that for a week.
1000133840.txt,And I sat down and wrote for over an hour.
1000133840.txt,One thing I like about writing letters is I always sit down and write them as though I'm talking to someone.
1000133840.txt,Maybe that's part of what's really hard to write papers is that if I felt really free to do that.
1000133840.txt,and then I sat down and looked -</p> Of August. Then I sat down and looked at where we were going and tried to figure out time wise and figured that I'd really be cutting myself if I tried to make it back by the first
1000133840.txt,Then I sat down and looked at where we were going and tried to figure out time wise and figured that I'd really be cutting myself if I tried to make it back by the first so I decided the fifteenth of August would be a good time to come back.
1000133840.txt,"In fact just this afternoon we sat down and talked - also that and this retreat this weekend with the people from Albany. I think I mentioned that we were excluding husbands, wives and all that.</p>"
1000133840.txt,And I know that was said as not wanting to just put someone down and say no but trying to be nice about it.
1000133840.txt,And I'll feel too uncomfortable if we try to work something out; Gary and I to get together. And that it is best left the way it is.
1000133840.txt,"I feel much better about it.</p> No, I don't think I'm ready to deal with a relationship except for Don and I. I don't think I'm ready to deal with that. I don't think our relationship is such that I can deal with it."
1000133840.txt,I don't think I'm at point where I can deal with it and be comfortable about it and feel completely good about it. That some of those comfortable feelings I had had are gone as a result of some of the guilt that Don has created in me.
1000133840.txt,That some of those comfortable feelings I had had are gone as a result of some of the guilt that Don has created in me. And I think he's more important to focus on than Gary is.</p>
1000133840.txt,And I was writing Ana telling her that everything had worked out alright except for a couple of days afterward feeling really down everything was fine. And it just is almost as though it never happened.</p>
1000133840.txt,"And I guess depending on what it does to you psychologically, but I really feel as though that was -</p> No. It's like I feel very much the same as I felt before."
1000133840.txt,"And it doesn't disturb me at all except in the sense that that was a really big crisis.</p> No, I don't feel it does at all. And I think part of it is there are so many things I'm looking forward to right now."
1000133840.txt,And I feel like I can't. It just rubs it in that he's not going.
1000133868.txt,I would be rather upset.
1000133868.txt,I'm not going to be worried about it.
1000133868.txt,"I just feel well, you know, she just doesn't want to. I don't think I would really be hurt."
1000133868.txt,"I just don't feel like it. And if it does hurt her, I'm sorry."
1000133868.txt,In fact it left me feeling kind of well. I was really kind of apprehensive about even saying it.
1000133868.txt,There really isn't anything that I really feel depressed about today. I was thinking about worrying.
1000133868.txt,"And I thought, if nobody did worry, no one would get anything done. But it sure would be a hell of a nice place to live."
1000133868.txt,I would be rather upset. I was talking to Ana downstairs
1000133868.txt,I'm not going to be worried about it. (Chuckles) I'm thinking about all the old college girls and if they're all married.
1004824723.txt,"I mean, I just feel that maybe that's part of the reason why I'm sad so often—that I don't look for (pause for .02 seconds) the things that I like, (pause for .02 seconds) and the people that I already have in my life are in the places that I occupy, you know?</p>"
1004824723.txt,"I've spent, like, six or seven days of the last week at David's place, and I feel like it's absurd for me to pay rent at the Square."
1004824723.txt,"I felt like with Victor I was beginning to share that, but maybe that was just the thrill of something new."
1004824723.txt,[00:22:16]</p> I just don't see him as being that emotional.
1004824723.txt,and I keep telling him this—it's stinging disappointment (ph) to realize you're not very emotional.
1004824723.txt,"So I guess this is probably a good reason to be confused cause you feel like you're so emotional, and how great it would be to have someone emotional to share your life with."
1004824723.txt,"Well, again, you know, having low self-esteem, I suppose, and feeling like this is it."
1004824723.txt,"I'm not really sure how that—I mean I'm sure it has affected me in some ways, but I've had boyfriends so it's not like (pause for .04 seconds)—I feel like things with my dad are far more, have been far more damaging to me than that."
1004824723.txt,"I feel affectionate towards him and I feel it's nice to see him, but I feel like (pause for .03"
1004824723.txt,"And again, I feel like is my—or Victor was like, ""You're crazy,"" or whatever, ""You have—you have this insatiable need."""
1004824723.txt,Well ignoring that—I feel like that is important to me—someone to understand me emotionally.
1004824723.txt,"I've spent, like, six or seven days of the last week at David's place, and I feel like it's absurd for me to pay rent at the Square. I keep getting tempted to call this one girl; I asked her to come look at the place if she was interested, and I think she's still interested."
1004824723.txt,"but there is a much deeper, much greater sense of loneliness that I feel like no one can begin to touch. I felt like with Victor I was beginning to share that, but maybe that was just the thrill of something new."
1004824723.txt,"I felt like with Victor I was beginning to share that, but maybe that was just the thrill of something new. I'm not sure."
1004824723.txt,"and I keep telling him this—it's stinging disappointment (ph) to realize you're not very emotional. And he's trying to be equally mean or something, and he's like, ""(inaudible at 00:23:05) me too, to realize you're not an intellectual."""
1004824723.txt,"Well, again, you know, having low self-esteem, I suppose, and feeling like this is it. Not being able to stand up for yourself."

1004824723.txt,"Well ignoring that—I feel like that is important to me—someone to understand me emotionally. You know that's what I meant when I was saying being with David, is the daily disappointment to know that he's not.—</p>"
1004824737.txt,and I'm really worried the next minute.
1004824737.txt,"If that works to help the effort a little bit, I'm down."
1004824737.txt,"I guess the long and short of it is that I feel pretty good, I guess, like I'm doing pretty good."
1004824737.txt,"I was like, ""All right, my head hurts because I'm excited/stressed and I'm working my ass off."""
1004824737.txt,"It's making me finally really take control of how I want things to go instead of just letting things unfold in some random—you know, and then feeling like, ""Why am I not able to . . ."""
1004824737.txt,What I feel good about is that I've been working hard.
1004824737.txt,I think that's why it feels genuine.
1004824737.txt,"It's not like, ""This week I feel like this."""
1004824737.txt,"I don't fucking care; whereas before, I would have either totally not have done the show, I would have found an excuse not to do it, or I would be stressing all fucking day worrying about things that are going to go wrong or be all nervous."
1004824737.txt,"It is interesting, though, that the one thing that gives me tension headaches is there is that space of feeling like I'm kind of happy, do you know what I mean?"
1004824737.txt,"That kind of annoys me actually, just like you can't be sad every moment."
1004824737.txt,"I feel so content in a way and I actually feel kind of empowered,"" but it's a big adrenalin rush, so that's making me feel a little"
1004824737.txt,and I'm really worried the next minute. It's a vulnerable thing.
1004824737.txt,So I think that's making me feel something. There's also that it's empowering.
1004824737.txt,"I feel like, you know what, I fucking believe in this and enough is enough. Every dumbass is doing some project and getting somewhere and are you kidding me?"
1004824737.txt,"I was like, ""All right, my head hurts because I'm excited/stressed and I'm working my ass off."" It's hard to sit in front of a computer or on your iPhone 10-12 hours a day."
1004824737.txt,"It's making me finally really take control of how I want things to go instead of just letting things unfold in some random—you know, and then feeling like, ""Why am I not able to . . ."" Well, yeah, you're not able if you don't enact or try to enact your will onto things."
1004824737.txt,What I feel good about is that I've been working hard. I'm reaping the rewards now of fucking hard work.
1004824737.txt,"I think that's why it feels genuine. It's not like, ""This week I feel like this."""
1004824737.txt,"It's not like, ""This week I feel like this."" I'm having my ups and downs but, overall, even in those dark moments something is like, ""Okay."
1004824737.txt,"Today you feel like . . ."" Even when I was here last week or the week before, there was something when I left here that was like—I can't explain it."
1004824737.txt,"So, clearly, he hobnobbed and some people gave big chunks, and that's exactly what I'm going to do if it comes down to that. There are still 15 days, so I'm hoping I might just have $500, hoping I can keep it going."
1004824737.txt,"I definitely feel like, ""Wow. I feel so content in a way and I actually feel kind of empowered,"" but it's a big adrenalin rush, so that's making me feel a little"
1004824737.txt,"I feel so content in a way and I actually feel kind of empowered,"" but it's a big adrenalin rush, so that's making me feel a little like it's causing tension in a way because my body and my mind doesn't know what to do with that."
1004824721.txt,"I was just like, I mean I see the other side now, but if you give me just two seconds I will be right back in that zone feeling really hurt and mad and betrayed and left and abandoned."
1004824721.txt,"That to me is like, I'm not—I'm sad."
1004824721.txt,I feel like David is all and all cerebral in a sense that he has ideas.
1004824721.txt,"And this feeling again of the moment that, until now I interpreted as me feeling strong and coming of age or whatever, felt—now I feel is sad, and devoid of that power that I initially inscribed to it."
1004824721.txt,"Being sad so much, having been sad so much, I feel like, ""This is not survival, you know?"
1004824721.txt,"Yeah, I feel bad for canceling but it's probably better that I did that cause the train stopped in the afternoon, and I wouldn't have had a way to get back to work, so (laughs) but –</p>"
1004824721.txt,"(laughs) (pause for .02 seconds) Let's see, I didn't take down notes from last time—I forgot. I should remember but this week's been a little busy for me."
1004824721.txt,"I was thinking about it—I didn't spend too much time thinking about it, but I feel I know what you're trying to get me to understand is that I should, again, have my own standards. I should be generous enough to myself that (pause for .02 seconds)"
1004824721.txt,"So, then I feel like. ""Oh, this is way too much."""
1004824721.txt,I feel like a baby when I say this but I'm being asked to do everything on my own here.
1004824721.txt,"I feel like a baby though.</p> I want to be coddled and loved and (laughs) just taken around and like tossed in the air and then get caught in strong arms, and so (laughs) pathetic.</p> (laughs)"
1004824721.txt,I feel (pause for .04 seconds) I used to feel a lot of pride at having (pause .02 seconds) withstood stuff like that—I don't know if that's the right word or if I'm being accurate.
1004824721.txt,"I used to feel a lot of pride at having (pause .02 seconds) withstood stuff like that—I don't know if that's the right word or if I'm being accurate. But, you know, when I was standing by the window in Bombay I felt (pause for .02 seconds)—I mean, every time I've thought about that moment, that I felt strong and proud that my grandma wasn't coddling me like I hear a lot of my friend's grandmas doing."
1004824721.txt,"That to me is like, I'm not—I'm sad. My goal is to be engaged and like curious and having a few cylinders firing at the same time, you know?"
1004824721.txt,"I feel like David is all and all cerebral in a sense that he has ideas. I mean, he's content and he's happy"

1004824721.txt,"(pause for .04 seconds) Or, or—and here's the crazy part (laughs)—maybe I don't feel power because I see myself failing and falling. I've survived until now, but you know, I still feel very dubious about whether this was a survival or not, you know?"
1004824721.txt,"I've survived until now, but you know, I still feel very dubious about whether this was a survival or not, you know? Being sad so much, having been sad so much, I feel like, ""This is not survival, you know?"
1000094419.txt,I wasn't feeling alright...
1000094419.txt,"I think my dad's stuff probably is something...anxiety, depression...my big sister, my older sister, has been on Wellbutrin (ph) for the last six months for ADD and depression."
1000094419.txt,"And so I think what I'd like to do is sort of figure out a way to mitigate that or to prevent that from happening; figure out a way....I need to...one of the big things that was going on with (inaudible) and I was her thought was that I was kind of disconnected, you know, sort of between what I was feeling and being able to talk about that."
1000094419.txt,"you know, as much as there are a lot of different things that can sort of set me into this place where I'm feeling really hateful about everything, I joke around...."
1000094419.txt,"you know, when I'm talking to friends, it's like I sort of feel like the worlds a horrible place"
1000094419.txt,"I did my first semester of law school over the summer and you know, getting into that and moving here seems to exacerbate a lot of anxiety kinds of issues that I had in the past and that particularly came to a head a couple of weeks before finals. I was in a relationship that ended kind of right around there too."
1000094419.txt,I don't know if I'm projecting my anxieties about taking medicine but I kind of felt like I was getting a big push from them.
1000094419.txt,"And I just had this big melt down...that this is sort of evidence that I could never be in a relationship and you know, was never capable of loving anybody; nobody's ever capable of loving me; and that was it and the world was awful and everything's going to end. You know, it was just this big thing."
1000094419.txt,I think I get probably fairly clingy fairly quickly and then something comes up that they don't.........they can't be in the relationship...it always feels like it comes up very suddenly and out of the blue and then that's it
1000094419.txt,"I know that ups and downs are normal, I think I just swing a little bit down probably more than most folks do and I think that that's getting worse the older I get"
1000094419.txt,"I don't want to keep feeling like this.

1004824735.txt,"And so there's—you know, I—I sort of realized—I'm starting to realize how to sort of manage these things and not feel burned out."
1004824735.txt,"Because I guess he has like he would pack—he would do these like really big salads, and like my stomach would feel big -</p> —not like physically big, but it was just feel like there's lots of stuff and fiber"
1004824735.txt,"Or at least I feel that they're pushy.</p> I mean, my family is pushy"
1004824735.txt,"But you know, I guess I was sort of feeling sort of insecure about whether we were actually going to get married and whether it was just going to continue on, and like whether graduate school—it was like I'm tired of things of getting held off for graduate school -</p>"
1004824735.txt,"Yeah, and I guess—I mean, that's one thing that my mom and I were laughing about because I—I said—because I was upset."
1004824735.txt,"Yeah, it felt really good -</p> —because I was just like I got all excited and -</p> Yeah.</p>"
1004824735.txt,"So I've been working pretty hard on this presentation and I was very nervous about giving it, well because—I mean, my advisor—like if you say something wrong, you know -</p> —he's not going to let you get away with it. As he shouldn't, but, you know, it's kind of embarrassing and it's like, you know—and it—it just sort of—reading through—my new project is based upon sort of a fundamental question that chemists have been trying to answer since 1930.</p>"
1004824735.txt,"I'm planning on going to bed early, but I mean, it's just—it was interesting like because like I didn't realize how stressed out I was getting by the whole presentation and my Ph. D., and like I was breaking out—I—like all over my body. And I -</p> —I mean, not serious, but normally, I don't break out say on my arms or -</p> —and you know, it's crazy because I just sort of—I sort of realized that anxiety is like something—it's really internal and like it really—I mean, even though I don't worry about stupid stuff -</p> —the anxiety is, you know—like I really see that it's good that I'm trying to learn how to manage it because it's—you know, it really affects my body -</p> —and it probably would affect most people's bodies."
1004824735.txt,"I don't know, I guess—I feel kind of—I feel kind of guilty, but then I realize that I'd rather get my life in order, like order more contacts and -</p> —(laughs) and get some sleep, and clean up a little bit, because, I don't know. I guess it's making sort of choices"
1004824735.txt,"And I was really wanting to talk to my family because like and—you know, I did something good -</p> —I was feeling hopeful about the future. I was talking to my mom"
1004824735.txt,"And so there's—you know, I—I sort of realized—I'm starting to realize how to sort of manage these things and not feel burned out. [00:18:03]</p> And sort of know like—and also actually with my eating, too, I've been figuring that out, too, because for a long time I've been working on this."
1004824735.txt,"I guess and also—like, you know, Jeremy was making lunches that were too big and it always made me really hungry and like so now I'm just sort of eating smaller lunches and maybe -</p> —you know, I don't ever feel like oddly full but hungry very soon. </p> Because I guess he has like he would pack—he would do these like really big salads, and like my stomach would feel big -</p> —not like physically big, but it was just feel like there's lots of stuff and fiber"
1004824735.txt,"And so I guess switching back to more what I prefer, I'm starting to get back into the feel of what -</p> —you know, what is the right amount, based upon how hungry I'm feeling.</p> And it—it's just interesting, because I—for the first—I don't know how this is happening, why I'm starting to make like decisions."
1004824735.txt,"Yeah, and I guess—I mean, that's one thing that my mom and I were laughing about because I—I said—because I was upset. I really wanted cats and I was tired of just like waiting until I finished my Ph. D. because I was really wondering or upset because I didn't think about—that's going to happen anytime soon.</p>"
1004824735.txt,"I really wanted cats and I was tired of just like waiting until I finished my Ph.

1000133856.txt,"Yeah that's - I think it's, there again, afraid to take the initiative, afraid to speak up and (Crosstalk)"
1000133856.txt,"But I enjoyed it much more, in fact, I wasn't - I didn't - I wasn't worried about having an erection as much as I was before."
1000133856.txt,well I've done that - why should I be afraid of this and I - it's really weird.
1000133856.txt,"But you have to - well when we sat down and they had left, my cousins, I thought - and my - with just my parents and I and Tanya who were there."
1000133856.txt,"And I said, ""Well I don't feel that I'm really ready."
1000133856.txt,Anybody who's ever even thought about it — it's a very frightening thing and she really kind of understood how I felt but she feels kind of the same way.
1000133856.txt,Because I'm - it's something that I am ashamed of and -</p>
1000133856.txt,I'm afraid to.</p>
1000133856.txt,I'm and I'm afraid what her reaction might be and
1000133856.txt,That's why I feel if she knew.</p>
1000133856.txt,It's really a good feeling like I had a choice now.
1000133856.txt,Nothing that I could be afraid of because I was doing something about it.</p> Right.</p>
1000133856.txt,So it was kind of a nice feeling to know that (Chuckle) I at least realized at that point.</p>
1000133856.txt,"Well I liked this with this Baptist minister, the other day who I met, and he really seemed like — and it was sad that he was quitting."
1000133856.txt,"and I said, ""Oh sometimes if I start thinking, if I start worrying about heading (ph) the erection it go and I don't have an erection and all the stuff and she seemed to be very sympathetic about the whole thing (Crosstalk)</p>"
1000133856.txt,"But I enjoyed it much more, in fact, I wasn't - I didn't - I wasn't worried about having an erection as much as I was before. Like it was getting to be easier and easier like -</p>"
1000133856.txt,"She said her sister, when her sister was down there, I think he just felt very uncomfortable around her and all that stuff and she says he's kind of black"
1000133856.txt,He has a feeling that she feels sorry he doesn't really want to be black or doesn't like to be black.</p> I was kind of happy she told me.
1000133856.txt,"But you have to - well when we sat down and they had left, my cousins, I thought - and my - with just my parents and I and Tanya who were there. And she was very polite and, of course, she would never offend my parents (inaudible at 0:23:04.0)</p> (inaudible at 0:23:05.5) of course you know she knows my parents; she likes them."
1000133856.txt,And she kind of really gets that feeling when you're with her.</p> Like I said maybe this is the only way she reacts towards men; she turns women off.
1000133856.txt,It's really a good feeling like I had a choice now. Nothing that I could be afraid of because I was doing something about it.</p> Right.</p>
1000133856.txt,"Well I liked this with this Baptist minister, the other day who I met, and he really seemed like — and it was sad that he was quitting. He's a very funny person, funny about how - he got up and, I don't know, if he meant it to be derogatory but he did a sermon as if he were a homosexual."
1000133856.txt,"So and it's really sad that they would stick him in a place like this where he's reaching no one and he's - that's why one of the reasons, I believe, he's leaving is because there's nothing to do."
1000013238.txt,"I wondered what it was like to [be dead] (ph).</p> Again, I wondered what it was like to [be dead] (ph).</p> Yeah, it's just kind of a general negative feeling."
1000013238.txt,"And just knowing that, I feel like it's kind of expected of me."
1000013238.txt,That would be pretty [lonely too] (ph).</p> There's not that many people I can talk to here (inaudible).</p> I'm just afraid to talk to people now.
1000013238.txt,I feel like I'm kind of closing in and all I can talk about now is things that seemed important to me that maybe I'm missing something that is really important.</p>
1000013238.txt,I don't feel right about feeling disappointed.</p> Because it would be like expecting something that she can't possibly do.</p>
1000013238.txt,"What makes it better is that you can stay up late the night before and you don't feel like getting up until like 11:00, then half the day is gone, so you don't have too much to ...too much time to fight that.</p> There's (ph) not really too much of a drive for it because I don't really need the money that bad."
1000013238.txt,"And I was driving down this road near our house and all that was on it ... there's a main highway about two blocks from our house, and all that was on it was semis. And right in the middle of about four semis that were all spitting out their exhaust and the air was kind of ... (coughs to illustrate) you know, like when you're following a bus."
1000013238.txt,"I don't know, I guess I can just kind of feel with the machine.</p> Not ""with,"" but I can know exactly what's happening in that machine."
1000013238.txt,"And I could just kind of feel, he didn't have a tachometer in his car, and I could just kind of feel when the engine wouldn't go any faster without (inaudible). And he thinks he has a real (inaudible) for a car and it's not that bad (ph).</p> Yeah."
1000013238.txt,It felt kind of wild but it's instinct for me.</p>
1000013238.txt,"I wondered what it was like to [be dead] (ph).</p> Again, I wondered what it was like to [be dead] (ph).</p> Yeah, it's just kind of a general negative feeling. All I can see is the bad.</p>"
1000013238.txt,"Just kind of ... not so much worried about other people just ... maybe angry at myself sometimes. Like this morning, I was driving down the street."
1000013238.txt,"Like this morning, I was driving down the street. It's a four-lane highway."
1000013238.txt,"she wants to have someone who is very close to her, to really appreciate her all the time, that makes her feel good. And just knowing that, I feel like it's kind of expected of me."
1000013238.txt,I just don't feel right about it somehow.</p> Mmm. And then it's ...
1000013238.txt,Because I felt that way when I get yelled at. He's a lot like me.
1000013238.txt,That would be pretty [lonely too] (ph).</p> There's not that many people I can talk to here (inaudible).</p> I'm just afraid to talk to people now. I think there was only a couple people I could talk to.</p>
1000133842.txt,"And, I think I'm kind of afraid of it."
1000133842.txt,Yeah I think that why-definitely why I'd be afraid of a -</p>
1000133842.txt,Yeah they used to have these-the first time in anything that I found myself I would be nervous.
1000133842.txt,Not-sometimes that's how I feel.
1000133842.txt,And I had found out that I really feel - that I'm gay.
1000133842.txt,I'd never been real nervous or anything.
1000133842.txt,I'm just afraid of doing-(inaudible at 0:35:02.1).
1000133842.txt,"It wasn't worth up to the sense that I was afraid to go, no."
1000133842.txt,"I really am afraid to go and tell them, what it was."
1000133842.txt,"It is sad, words (ph) like sinner, I mean I did confess it."
1000133842.txt,"I wouldn't have been there, if I didn't feel bad about-I would never have said anything if I didn't feel bad about it."
1000133842.txt,"That, and the feeling that, ""Okay if I did take the initiative, this person might feel that I am feeling committed."
1000133842.txt,Kind of a feeling. When I-whenever (ph) I end up with a woman and we're having a sexual relationship.
1000133842.txt,"Not-sometimes that's how I feel. Maybe-like this thing here, I probably-maybe-the more experience and my knowledge more or less is at the bottom of my experiences."
1000133842.txt,But with someone it's kind of nervous. I tend to fill in silence with someone else sitting right.
1000133842.txt,"And I'd like to share feelings with someone and do things and all that sort of stuff. Of course sometimes, I'd like to be alone too."
1000133842.txt,"And I, like I said, I felt that, ""Well, if you had known this before, then why did you even start?"" As far as this was concerned."
1000133842.txt,I felt that I had been brainwashed. And I still think that it wasn't good.
1000133842.txt,"It wasn't worth up to the sense that I was afraid to go, no. And go up and tell them and afraid of being balled out probably."
1000133842.txt,"I really am afraid to go and tell them, what it was. Which I -  which they say I shouldn't be."
1000133842.txt,"That, and the feeling that, ""Okay if I did take the initiative, this person might feel that I am feeling committed. That I am committing myself at that point too."
1004824709.txt,"So, I guess I'm worried that you wouldn't be somebody that I wouldn't like to talk about books with."
1004824709.txt,"and then there is this, I—. Like, I feel like religion and psychology are both completely inseparable and really probably shouldn't mix that much."
1004824709.txt,"I, in that I feel like the any question of God is, you know, my relationship with God is pretty central to my life."
1004824709.txt,"I guess it's just like throwing in to sharp relief, the ways in which I work anyway of you know, if I am having a bad day then that brings down the people I care about and so like I just try not to. Then I'll be starting at 11:30 (ph) tomorrow."
1004824709.txt,"I feel bad saying that, but, you know, basically I like to talk books, about book with Amanda.</p> Yeah and that's about it."
1004824709.txt,"You know, it feels like I, I get trapped in to expecting things out of people that it's not reasonable for them to be able to do and yes, that does apply pretty broadly also. (laughter) I'm thinking that this is more or less like minor thing or a harmless thing."
1004824709.txt,"I, in that I feel like the any question of God is, you know, my relationship with God is pretty central to my life. Pretty, pretty much the thing that is going on or one of the, the big things, but it's like nobody else is speaking the some language as you or nobody else that I actually meet and talk to and so I, but then also I—</p>"

1000060759.txt,I used to be just crushed and now at least I'm angry.
1000060759.txt,"And I'm angry at Marco too, for like keeping me so far away when I know that he cares and he knows that he cares."
1000060759.txt,"and I'm also angry for like putting me in that position, because he knows that I love him and he knows that I'm really, in some emotional way, always going to be involved with him."
1000060759.txt,But I'm also scared to call him on it.
1000060759.txt,"I'm also scared to say, man...because I'm always scared he's going to say, 'fuck you, I don't care.'"
1000060759.txt,You know like although somewhere I know that he wouldn't mean it and that he was just hiding...but I'm scared he'll do that.</p>
1000060759.txt,"I mean Holly's away, and she was here and I felt pretty far away from her."
1000060759.txt,And I feel really like there's nothing I can do now.</p>
1000060759.txt,And also that I'm feeling just excluded from the families that are being created that I'm not in.</p>
1000060759.txt,and I'm really scared that...that somehow the vortex is...or the place to be or something is here
1000060759.txt,I mean it's not making me happy and I'm not feeling good
1000060759.txt,I feel that about - there's this crazy scale.
1000060759.txt,"You know like except for immediately, as soon as you say that I feel that's not true."
1000076649.txt,I'm really angry at you.
1000076649.txt,I'm angry at everyone.
1000076649.txt,"All right, do you want me to tell you what I'm all angry about?</p>"
1000076649.txt,"I'm just sort of angry at you, because I just feel like instead of - I just feel like I've got more responsibility once I got involved in this thing than I had before I went out."
1000076649.txt,and I feel like there's all this added shit being piled on me.
1000076649.txt,"Like, well, I just feel like, all of a sudden, here it's like I'm just getting all involved in this thing I don't want to be in any more."
1000076649.txt,"I'm really scared, I want to get out of it, and I thought you - what you said was really stupid; I don't know why the hell you said it."
1000076649.txt,"I think the whole thing is so absurd, and then I just felt today was like the last straw."
1000076649.txt,"All right?</p> I'm still really - you know, I'm angry."
1000076649.txt,"You know, I'm angry."
1000076649.txt,"It's not I'm afraid you are, right?"
1000076649.txt,But I still have a right to be angry at you for...</p>
1000076649.txt,"And so that did have more implication, and I think I had still every right, you know, to be - I'm not as angry now because I'm tightened (ph) now"
1000076649.txt,"but... 0:18:19.6</p> Right.</p> (Inaudible at 0:20:43.1)</p> I don't care now if you like me or not, I really don't, so I don't think I'm worried about failing now.</p>"
1000076649.txt,"Yes, I do sometimes just hope - that feeling is just everyone is pressuring me to do things.</p>"
1000076649.txt,"We went through it, because that's what I feel like."
1000076649.txt,"I just felt ridic - I felt, ""Oh, you are so out to lunch,"""
1000076649.txt,"And then this other girl, that I was worried about her because I didn't - well, then all of a sudden, I said what the hell are you doing in this classroom with these kids?"
1000076649.txt,"How many people you want?</p> Six guys, six girls?</p> [Don't feed me] (ph) I'm scared kind of...</p>"
1000076649.txt,I'm scared of sort of group things.</p>
1000076649.txt,"Well, no, I didn't feel good inwardly, because it's a joke.</p>"
1000076649.txt,"I was going to be angry the whole time I was in here; I was determined to be that way, really.</p>"
1000076649.txt,"You know, I don't' feel like there's all this pressure on me or responsibility."
1000076649.txt,I'm really angry at you. I'm angry at everyone.
1000076649.txt,"I just feel - I have all this shit piled on top of me; I can't stand it any more.</p> Probably hit people, throw things, swear, I don't know.</p> I really - the thing that I usually just do is step out away from it."
1000076649.txt,"I just feel like, you know, like there's all this sort of stuff involved in - shit, I don't know. Like, well, I just feel like, all of a sudden, here it's like I'm just getting all involved in this thing I don't want to be in any more."
1000076649.txt,"Like, well, I just feel like, all of a sudden, here it's like I'm just getting all involved in this thing I don't want to be in any more. I'm really scared, I want to get out of it, and I thought you - what you said was really stupid; I don't know why the hell you said it."
1000076649.txt,"I'm really scared, I want to get out of it, and I thought you - what you said was really stupid; I don't know why the hell you said it. I thought it took - you know, it was unfair advantage of the relationship, which, naturally, in sort of a therapy relationship, the client feels things for the therapist, because he's listening and stuff like that, and then you just sort of blew my mind at the end of the session."
1000076649.txt,"I think the whole thing is so absurd, and then I just felt today was like the last straw. And to have to think about what's going on in here, plus all the other shit I have to think about, it's not worth it, it's just not worth it.</p>"
1000076649.txt,"Well, I feel like an asshole, throwing the damn Kleenex box.</p> Seriously, I'm going to hit you another five minutes (inaudible at 0:06:33.3)."
1004687652.txt,"oh I'm disappointed, that's a shame."
1004687652.txt,"Usually, like I said, by the time they get to that point they're so angry that they don't, they don't usually hit.</p>"
1004687652.txt,"oh, I'm the person that finished, but sometimes I just feel like I just...I'm being a glutton for punishment and then sort of make myself feel bad about it.</p>"
1004687652.txt,"So, I, um...I'm not going to let myself, ya know, get into that belief and I'm not gonna tell...let anybody tell me right now about this, how what will and will not make me feel good and get accomplished cuz that's...I, I'm kind of...especially academically I feel like it's bullshit."
1004687652.txt,I've always felt like it's bullshit.
1004687652.txt,so they aren't the center of attention afterward and they're like so why am I so depressed.
1004687652.txt,"I just feel like when I get like that it's just not, ya know?</p> (Pause)"
1004687652.txt,and you took it out on me...and not just took it out on me but that you're angry with me about it.
1004687652.txt,How in the world is it that like I'm angry.
1004687652.txt,and I needed to take care of the situation but in no way was I angry at you.
1004687652.txt,I'm just angry cuz I'm covered in ya know whatever.</p>
1004687652.txt,I feel like it's awful that he (pause)
1004687652.txt,"I, most of the things that I heard, though, it's like it's really none of my business to yell at her about, but I find it disturbing that, ya know, her 9- or 10-year-old son has to look to his younger or older sister to tell him what he's feeling."
1004687652.txt,"Um, I don't feel comfortable trying to be intimate with him if he's been acting out recently which just makes me feel very (inaudible at 00:01:22).

1004687652.txt,"So, but...ya know with all the stress that's been going on I really would like to gain some comfort from my husband but he's off somewhere else and so it's been, ya know, quite frustrating."
1004687652.txt,and I feel kind of a bit of a jerk for wanting these things but like recently I was like ya know
1004687652.txt,"oh I'm disappointed, that's a shame. But like the fact that it had to be like a oh, no, everything's fine ya know, and like I'm going to make you feel like you're going to...like you're the one's that's...every single thing that you think seems off is just you just overreacting or something...you're, you're, you're misplacing your concern on me."

I think that's part of the reason why, by the way, that I always doubt my own judgment now is that I have been given by so many people um, between him and his family,"
1004687652.txt,"Usually, like I said, by the time they get to that point they're so angry that they don't, they don't usually hit.</p> So, but yes, it gets to be that (inaudible at 00:07:02)."
1004687652.txt,but...I mean that doesn't make us any different than air traffic controllers or...there's a lot of very high-stress jobs where people put a lot of pressure on you. It's not like it's (sighs)...you go into it with your eyes open.
1004687652.txt,"I don't have a metric to compare myself to and feel like a failure basically, and supposedly the actual language itself is a lot simpler than you'd think it would be cuz they have very...they don't have any um short vowels. Like it's always...the word Nikon is neekon, not nykon."
1004687652.txt,"But instead of yes-I-stuck-with-it-and-I-finished feeling, I get the wow, this totally confirms that I suck at this.</p> So, I, um...I'm not going to let myself, ya know, get into that belief and I'm not gonna tell...let anybody tell me right now about this, how what will and will not make me feel good and get accomplished cuz that's...I, I'm kind of...especially academically I feel like it's bullshit."

I've always felt like it's bullshit."
1004687652.txt,"I've always felt like it's bullshit. Like people can tell me what's going to give me satisfaction but they have no idea, and so if I'm doing it for my own edification then...</p> ...I'm just not gonna listen to it.</p> I'm...that's easier for me to go with my instincts on...</p> ...cuz I know myself very well.</p> Um, other things ya know, telling me"
1004687652.txt,"so they aren't the center of attention afterward and they're like so why am I so depressed. And like well, I don't think it's quite like that, but thanks for trying.</p>"
1004687652.txt,"I just feel like when I get like that it's just not, ya know?</p> (Pause) I think that when I get that way I just let myself get too..."
1004687652.txt,(pause) Like I spent most of 2002 to 2003 feeling sorry for myself.</p> (Pause) I mean that isn't just the only time
1004687652.txt,"I mean yes I found lots and lots of causes for it but basi...the concept is that I get sick, I get upset and then something happens and then like this perfect storm happens and the next thing you know I'm like at the hospital with colitis or something like that ya know? It only happens when I let myself get really, really stuck and wallowing."
1004687652.txt,"It's really hard when like your emotions create something like this, something that is actually...like I said it's not the only thing that created this, but it creates something that's very real too. It isn't just like well I have an upset stomach."

1004687646.txt,"Um, and after the fire uh, he was like very...he felt very guilty for not having gone for a fire extinguisher which he saw and thought about but didn't...like I think he would have had to either walk past what was burning or like...it was kind of weird, but he saw the extinguisher but didn't use it and felt really bad about it. </p>"
1004687646.txt,And I think that felt that she's not...
1004687646.txt,And when we do talk what's funny is it always feels like—and not because (inaudible at 00:26:34].3)—it just always feels like I just talked to her.
1004687646.txt,And I was really upset.
1004687646.txt,I was upset that my friend...I feel like she was blowing me off in saying like...</p> ...(inaudible at 00:28:04].2) and crazy
1004687646.txt,Like I'm like...do I not....like I feel like I sort of want my friend to stop complaining or stop agreeing or something.
1004687646.txt,"I feel kind of weirdly, sometimes really drawn into some kind of...like are they just (inaudible at 00:31:34].3) and then like kind of that and then just go back to their partner."
1004687646.txt,But I don't like...I don't sit around feeling bad about it.
1004687646.txt,I mean not fearing...am I feeling okay not dating because I'm too scared to date (inaudible at 00:35:53].0).
1004687646.txt,Like it feels more like I'm just (inaudible at 00:37:47].3).
1004687646.txt,"I mean definitely, I definitely had a...like very strongly felt for a while that I was really scared of dating again..."
1004687646.txt,like I don't feel like I totally...if I die unmarried that's fine.
1004687646.txt,And I'm kind of upset about that but I also don't want to go have a baby.
1004687646.txt,"I was just so angry at him for...like I was (inaudible [00:03:52].5) like in a vague way and then I got in on Sunday morning, like he was already drinking"
1004687646.txt,"some and I purchased a 6-pack for her as well, and then Sunday morning they were down to like 4 beers. I'm like I had 1 or 2, Zoe had 1 or 2 and what the fuck."
1004687646.txt,"And I just feel like I can never just...like I just want to see her and it's hard in general to (inaudible [00:09:48].6) your boyfriend, but I'm also like I don't understand why you're attached at the hip when you agreed he's kind of a jerk."
1004687646.txt,"And I think that felt that she's not... she says she's not attractive enough, so I feel like having severe burns is not like, she's gonna not want to date even more."
1004687646.txt,And I felt like I didn't have a good reason to break up with him. Like it's my fault ya know.
1004687646.txt,"I mean like riding to work when he would...if I told him he had upset me he would say I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and work really hard to fix it for a month and then go right back to being (inaudible [00:18:59].7).</p> Um, (inaudible [00:19:02].5) I had done this and let me tell you he's not going to stop and it sucks."
1004687646.txt,"And I knew that emotions don't work like that. Ya know this is sort of like, like you are this smart, intelligent, awesome, successful woman and you're boyfriend's a loser who doesn't have a job and still just (inaudible [00:20:37].5) his parents and takes her money and is an alcoholic and all these other things."
1004687646.txt,and I find it slightly creepy because I feel like why can't you separate. It's like (inaudible at 00:23:54].7)
1004687646.txt,"And I also, like I don't (pause)...I just do not feel great about kind of pulling back because she's in this relationship. Um, but there was a time when like she could use an extra friend...</p> ..."
1004687646.txt,(A) really upset that (inaudible [00:27:59].7). I was upset that my friend...I feel like she was blowing me off in saying like...</p> ...(inaudible at 00:28:04].2) and crazy
1004687646.txt,I was upset that my friend...I feel like she was blowing me off in saying like...</p> ...(inaudible at 00:28:04].2) and crazy and I was like fuck!
1004687646.txt,Like I feel like...</p> Like I'm really involved in this kind of weird tangential way.
1004687646.txt,"But I don't like...I don't sit around feeling bad about it. Um, I probably do sit around sometimes thinking..."
1004687646.txt,"Like it feels more like I'm just (inaudible at 00:37:47].3). Um, the one thing I do (inaudible at 00:37:59].4) is I'm like mmm, um I haven't been..."
1004687646.txt,"I don't want to say I don't really feel like it. I mean definitely, I definitely had a...like very strongly felt for a while that I was really scared of dating again..."
1003269450.txt,"No, I neglected to tell him that, but he was not angry."
1003269450.txt,"The thing is that he is really understanding, and I probably would have been really angry with him for not telling me, and all this, but it was not an issue.</p>"
1003269450.txt,And then once you feel better sometimes you are I do not know if I really need it.
1003269450.txt,"And although I do feel like it is justified in some ways depending upon the situation, it is still excessive."
1003269450.txt,and so it was exactly what I feel like I need.</p>
1003269450.txt,I felt completely opposite. I was like I really like teaching.
1003269450.txt,"No, I neglected to tell him that, but he was not angry. The thing is that he is really understanding, and I probably would have been really angry with him for not telling me, and all this, but it was not an issue.</p>"
1003269450.txt,"The thing is that he is really understanding, and I probably would have been really angry with him for not telling me, and all this, but it was not an issue.</p> Yes, and I mean, for the first three days I was not hysterical, but on the verge of tears at every second."
1003269450.txt,"I do not know, should I really talk to someone about this, because you know sometimes you call people, because you are in such a panic state. And then once you feel better sometimes you are I do not know if I really need it."
1003269450.txt,And then once you feel better sometimes you are I do not know if I really need it. But it is not just this situation.
1003269450.txt,"And although I do feel like it is justified in some ways depending upon the situation, it is still excessive. The carrying on, the crying, the calling people nonstop because I am like desperate to talk.</p> And a little bit more traumatic, yes.</p>"
1004798835.txt,I don't know; just to be nice because I felt bad for him.
1004798835.txt,"He kind of started making me feel guilty like it's only been this amount of time, even though last week it's already been a month and you're still thinking about this, so that when it's him"
1004798835.txt,"I literally am addicted, like can't not do it, feel like I don't know what's driving me, right?"
1004798835.txt,I was feeling really sad and I was talking to my mom on the phone.
1004798835.txt,I was just feeling really sad.
1004798835.txt,"and I just wished stuff hadn't gotten all messed up and was feeling sad that he also, even though I said I wouldn't respond to him, he's now texting me like, ""Hey, I did this today,"" or ""Hey, hope you're well."
1004798835.txt,"Have a good day,"" like, ""You're the one that should be pursuing me, so I was feeling bad about that."
1004798835.txt,"Last night I had been feeling so sad—poor Franklin—and I didn't talk to him at all yesterday, night or during the day or today at all, and I'm not planning to."
1004798835.txt,"I've been dealing for so long with him convincing me that my feelings aren't exactly what they are or that I'm looking at things differently than anybody else would and having different reactions than anybody else would; and, therefore, I'm more dramatic and over the top."
1004798835.txt,"It upsets me and it hurts my feelings, but I think it makes me more angry than anything because here I've put all this emotion and effort and he's talking about how sad he is and how he comes home and cries"
1004798835.txt,I was feeling pretty proud of myself when I was at home
1004798835.txt,[00:11:57] I also feel like we're in a game of who's going to call who first?
1004798835.txt,"There I am, sitting at home, worried, thinking, ""Is he sad?"
1004798835.txt,"Yeah, it is hopeless, but to the same extent I feel like that situation—I do feel a little helpless because there's nothing I've been able to say or do that is going to make him act differently."
1004798835.txt,"And I don't feel that reciprocated and if I continue to not feel that reciprocated, that's it."
1004798835.txt,I guess I was feeling more emotional about it during the week
1004798835.txt,"Then this whole thing this morning with his stupid Facebook post about being hung over like, ""What am I stressing over saving right now?"
1004798835.txt,How many times have I been so irritated with him dominating conversations with his ridiculous theories on things?
1004798835.txt,He makes me feel like I'm a party pooper.
1004798835.txt,Going to things that he wants to go to that I might not feel as comfortable at and feeling guilty if I don't go and him making me feel like I'm a party pooper if I don't go.
1004798835.txt,"It's really nice and not be worried about somebody asking what time I'm going to be home and feeling pressure or guilt like, ""I'm just going to stay in then,"" because he did that a lot"
1004798835.txt,"Again, I think I was feeling sad about it all week and then this morning I woke up after having those dreams that made me annoyed and seeing his annoying not-progressive post, now I don't feel sad as much as just, ""Fuck it."
1004798835.txt,"I just want to kind of get a better handle on my reactions to things and how I'm feeling with things, and not rely so much on thinking what other people's opinions or people's thoughts about it—more relying on my own feelings and instincts, I think, is important, too."
1004798835.txt,"[00:36:32] That was a big problem I was having, so I feel that's a good thing."
1004798835.txt,"He's making me feel guilty. She's like, ""What has he done in terms of what your terms were for making this work?"""
1004798835.txt,"She's like, ""But, honestly, you need to take care of yourself and you're way too concerned about how he's feeling and all this stuff,"" similar to what we were talking about. [00:01:02 So then I went to dinner with some girlfriends, which was really nice, and then I went home."
1004798835.txt,I don't know; just to be nice because I felt bad for him. He was kind of like . . .
1004798835.txt,"He kind of started making me feel guilty like it's only been this amount of time, even though last week it's already been a month and you're still thinking about this, so that when it's him it's ""only"" been a month and ""I've been doing so much"
1004798835.txt,"He was just kind of getting on me trying to bully me down from my soapbox, basically, and at one point said, ""How about this, Trina. I'm not going to talk to you for a while."
1004798835.txt,"I literally am addicted, like can't not do it, feel like I don't know what's driving me, right? Then the next day I had open house, my big annual opening event, big reception with music and catering and the whole thing, so I was very busy the whole day."
1004798821.txt,I'm feeling really overwhelmed and tired.
1004798821.txt,I'm overwhelmed because I don't like the distracting and sort of tiring process of taking medication and adjusting to it and thinking about whether it's useful or...[pause]...even like noticing little things that make you feel like you're taking medication.
1004798821.txt,"But more than that, it's the...it sort of feels like a grand stage and I don't really mean that in the performative way, but more like this like theater where it's like a super set of all the other things they do in my life."
1004798821.txt,It's also kind of [pause]...it's kind of exhilarating because it's always sort of a surprise what I'm going to talk about and what you might have to say about it and how I might feel after.
1004798821.txt,Maybe...I think in some sense if I felt like I was...
1004798821.txt,"So I feel like I can communicate extremely free in here.</p> Aside from that, yeah, I guess it's...jazz rehearsal, I can sort of like forget after it's over."
1004798821.txt,It's also kind of [pause]...it's kind of exhilarating because it's always sort of a surprise what I'm going to talk about and what you might have to say about it and how I might feel after. And I don't think most things are that surprising.
1004798821.txt,"Maybe...I think in some sense if I felt like I was... I don't think the woman part is that important, but it's like the type of person I'm imagining, I don't know that many men...[pause]."
1004798821.txt,"I don't feel hurt. I don't think hurtful is the right word, but maybe less..."
1004798821.txt,"I feel pretty secure in my [inaudible 49:55] lab, so you can...</p> At least right now, that's not important.</p> Thanks.</p>"
1004513666.txt,I mean I'm still nervous about spending more time with him in Massachusetts because I don't trust that these things will last for a longtime.
1004513666.txt,"But it was a relief to see that for now he's doing well and that um, maybe (pause) that I can ... that I can be around him and I can feel okay and that ..."
1004513666.txt,That it made me feel safe enough to feel confident and be okay
1004513666.txt,I'm feeling that also that I'm not putting too much weight into it.
1004513666.txt,Like I have girl cousins who are twelve and Fifteen who were down this time and I have two other girl cousins who are twenty-one and eighteen.
1004513666.txt,I've always felt like the one on the outside being like (pause) just doing things or saying things a little different
1004513666.txt,Well I feel like I'm afraid of taking on their strongest (pause) like character flaws.
1004513666.txt,I just feel like it would be something that I could be like proud of and be different from (pause) from them and too that I can just something on my own.
1004513666.txt,"but I'm not afraid at the end of the day either to just say like, ""I don't need this."
1004513666.txt,Like I just felt so ... I mean I'm still nervous about spending more time with him in Massachusetts because I don't trust that these things will last for a longtime.
1004513666.txt,"I mean I'm still nervous about spending more time with him in Massachusetts because I don't trust that these things will last for a longtime.

1004513666.txt,"But it was a relief to see that for now he's doing well and that um, maybe (pause) that I can ... that I can be around him and I can feel okay and that ... like I was really confident around the whole family the whole time which was really unusual for me I think in part because my dad was so even keeled and predictable."
1004513666.txt,That it made me feel safe enough to feel confident and be okay and just ... like let some of the things my grandmother said kind of slide.</p>
1004513666.txt,I left and I felt like I can even point to a thing with him that would have ... it was just amazing.
1004513666.txt,"I'm feeling that also that I'm not putting too much weight into it. I'm not, you know ..."
1004513666.txt,I really feel like (pause) um (pause) no matter what happens I will always have had that weekend with him. And so I'm really happy with that.
1004513666.txt,"But I mean immediately like that gets in my head like, ""How did you ever know what my brothers get when they come down here?"" And so ... I don't know, so whatever (pause) you know Chris's (inaudible00:09:50) like it's fine."
1004513666.txt,And you know she came down and spent the whole first day at the beach with us. A family that I grew up babysitting for; who I was really close too.
1004513666.txt,Like I have girl cousins who are twelve and Fifteen who were down this time and I have two other girl cousins who are twenty-one and eighteen. And their family doesn't come down for it anymore because of an incident that happened with my girl cousin who is twenty-one.
1004513666.txt,I've always felt like the one on the outside being like (pause) just doing things or saying things a little different and so when I'm like back around everybody
1004513666.txt,Like since we were down there I hear myself sounding like her. And whether it's true or not I just hear it.
1004513666.txt,So I feel like I'm always waiting to prove myself ... prove to myself that I like ... I'm just always seeing things that are like them instead of seeing things that aren't like them.
1004513666.txt,"I always feel like they're going to judge me and then they get really easily in my head about it. I said, ""Well I was thinking about taking some business and entrepreneurship classes because I have this idea (pause)"
1004513666.txt,"but I feel like if I could do something like that it would make me different me, it would make me (pause) I don't know not only is it something that I'm really excited about"
1004513666.txt,"so I guess that was one of the things that me feel like I could proof to myself that I'm nothing like them. Because none of them ... that's not the driving force behind it, obviously."
1004798809.txt,I just don't feel like I'm good for anything when I'm like this.
1004798809.txt,I guess what I'm afraid of isn't that I will say something that I don't want to share with you or that I don't want to come out.
1004798809.txt,"But yeah, I, yeah, I, I missed her and I felt like it was my responsibility to take care of her."
1004798809.txt,"And I was really upset because like, that's the one thing that they tell kids is like smoking will kill you."
1004798809.txt,"I feel kind of like a vegetable right now. It's like, ""Well I can't, I can't figure things out as a vegetable."""
1004798809.txt,"Like all I remember is, is like waking up one morning and coming down into the kitchen and there were these ladies from church that I didn't know very well in the kitchen and my mother was gone. And eventually, like, I was told that she was in the hospital."
1004798809.txt,"[00:33:00]</p> I would, she would just drop off the map for long periods of time or what felt like long periods of time. There was one time that I was at camp and she was really good about like, she would always send me a care package when I was camp which was really nice."
1004565041.txt,"I'm afraid to because I don't want to, I don't want to bum her out either."
1004565041.txt,"Especially having gone to those places with her after it happened, when she knows and she was upset with me and I was feeling like crap."
1004565041.txt,But it's the very thing that I'm so angry with my dad about.
1004565041.txt,"I'm afraid to because I don't want to, I don't want to bum her out either. I mean I think I've told her that for me, we've got friends from Canada recently, we just went down there to see them, and she's talking about having a house down there."
1004565041.txt,"I mean I think I've told her that for me, we've got friends from Canada recently, we just went down there to see them, and she's talking about having a house down there. And for me I think I told her that look Canada is not something I feel -"
1004565041.txt,And for me I think I told her that look Canada is not something I feel - I mean it's tainted for me.
1004565041.txt,"Especially having gone to those places with her after it happened, when she knows and she was upset with me and I was feeling like crap. And that being the memory that I have of those places and the memory I've had of being in Canada for three months after that where I just felt like shit and I - so yes."
1004565041.txt,And that being the memory that I have of those places and the memory I've had of being in Canada for three months after that where I just felt like shit and I - so yes. And yet somehow I will forget those things when I'm out in the street.
1004565041.txt,How do I forget how awful I felt for so long to even today and yet I'm still able to just...
1004565041.txt,It's like I know I'm going to feel like hell. I know we're leaving the country in August.
1004565041.txt,But it's the very thing that I'm so angry with my dad about. That he didn't get help for me - and I was one of the ones who was affected by his failures.
1004528627.txt,And that's kind of what I'm afraid of.
1004528627.txt,"And to me, I'm kind of scared about going back."
1004528627.txt,"I want them to, to know what it's like to be back down where they were."
1004528627.txt,And I feel the best thing to do is to just walk away from them.
1004528627.txt,"So, in reality I see the business has hit its peak and now I see it coming down. And I've, I wanted to be there to right the ship to keep it up, but I finally realized you know, a year and a half ago that anything I say they're not going to listen to; they're not going to value my opinion, they're not going to you know, listen to me, they think I'm out to get them."
1004528627.txt,And that's kind of what I'm afraid of. Is she's just gonna you know blow something up.
1004528627.txt,"You know, I, I did feel homesick and did all that stuff, but after being back, I don't want to be there anymore. I, I don't want to be there anymore, I can't do it."
1004528627.txt,"And to me, I'm kind of scared about going back. About being pulled back because it kind of reverts the me moving out."
1004528627.txt,"I want them to, to know what it's like to be back down where they were. To remember what it was like."
1004528627.txt,And I feel the best thing to do is to just walk away from them. [00:36:40]</p> About me not being able to work anymore.
1004528627.txt,and I'd always go to work because I felt bad. I was always guilted into it.
1004528627.txt,"You know, and my feeling is this. If they were going to lose me, they would rather lose me rather than four workers, three workers."
1004478010.txt,"I used to be really embarrassed about my past like, mortified."
1004478010.txt,"And like, no he's never said that to me but it's just what I think is probably his feeling on the situation."
1004478010.txt,"then I guess like, I guess my feeling is like, ""What is there to say?"""
1004478010.txt,I feel like he's going like that those are negative feelings that he has about me.
1004478010.txt,"I feel like, like everything can't be that.</p>"
1004478010.txt,That's how I felt.
1004478010.txt,"you know as a kid it is a weird sense of power that I felt like, ""I'm responsible for this?"""
1004478010.txt,But I feel like it was just always shaky and I've always have just been shaky and I'm trying to not be anymore.
1004478010.txt,like when he gets in a bad mood I just have to then ... instead of talking about it I just get mean for some reason if I've had a few drinks. And so him and his friends were ...
1004478010.txt,"It makes him really frustrated and then there's nothing more I can say ... the only thing I can say the next day is like, ""I'm sorry."""
1004478010.txt,He felt ... I think the only reason he thought it was inappropriate was because he didn't want to be in that situation.
1004478010.txt,"I used to be really embarrassed about my past like, mortified. And now it's just for me"
1004478010.txt,"And like, no he's never said that to me but it's just what I think is probably his feeling on the situation. I think that he has his own feelings about his history but I don't think they're really, to me, I don't think like compares them."
1004478010.txt,So like I think sometimes about like you know about talking about it but feel like he'll probably just shutdown. I don't know what ... like what is there to say anymore?
1004478010.txt,And so I feel like if I keep bringing it up like ... you know he's already told me two times that's not the case.
1004478010.txt,I feel like ... I don't think any husband wants to talk about like how many people their wife's been with before.
1004478010.txt,"And so, I feel like I don't want to bring up this ... these negative feelings he's got about me."
1004478010.txt,these negative feelings he's got about me. And this idea of this person that I was before hand.
1004478010.txt,So part of me feels weird about bringing it up for that reason.</p> I don't want you to remember this person that I was before.
1004478010.txt,"I know that he feels so uncomfortable with it because he knows who I used to be and how I used to be and that type of behavior was just lead to me getting a bunch of guys. And so I think when we're out and he sees me acting like that, acting all flirty and like I'm flirting with girls too, that's just my ..."
1004478010.txt,"I feel like at least. It may not be, I might just be a mean person."
1004478010.txt,Like you know I've told that I said things that I just like do not think or feel or just saying things to say them. And I think I'm just trying to get a reaction.
1004478010.txt,"But like, there were, you know shove me down the stairs for no reason or like spankings when I was little like weren't really ... I don't know I think just like smacking a kid isn't really a spanking that's just getting hit."
1004478010.txt,"I didn't have this guilt where I felt like, ""Oh my parents ... I hope I'm not responsible for whatever it's worth."""
1004478010.txt,"you know as a kid it is a weird sense of power that I felt like, ""I'm responsible for this?"" Then it's mixed bags."
1004478010.txt,"I don't know, I just feel broken. Like I was never put together right."
1004478010.txt,I feel like I never got the chance to be a whole person. Like I was always just turmoiled.
1000094790.txt,"I feel like most of the time I'm mid-moderate. Sometimes I'm high moderate, you know."
1000094790.txt,"And then you know, after a while I feel like you know my knees are hurting and on fire.</p> It's like ugh.</p> No. </p>"
1000122436.txt,I think that I have probably been depressed since I got back from Columbia the first time I was there.</p> I've been there twice.
1000122436.txt,"[giggles] I'm just nervous, because I've been in therapy before but it has always been with the same therapist."
1000122436.txt,I felt like it would be a good thing.
1000122436.txt,My parents were divorced when I was about eight years old and sometimes I feel like it is too much
1000122436.txt,Sometimes I feel like he's very on top of me.
1000122436.txt,"And he's just angry at him because, he, you know, one of his old girlfriends had a couple of abortions in the past and she thinks it was really irresponsible of him and he realizes I played a part in it, but he's very, very angry with him."
1000122436.txt,"So I can't really discuss it with him unless I'm ready to be angry with him and just say horrible things about him, and he prefers to hear that"
1000122436.txt,"My friend Mary who became a very good friend of mine when we came to Columbia the first time is also a very good friend of this person and she, a couple of nights ago I'm on the phone with her and she said, ""Well, I can imagine that your father would be very angry, but just remember that you know, I would hate him too, and I would be very angry with him too, but I know him"
1000122436.txt,"And when I was upset about something it was kind of like, ""All right, what else?"" kind of thing.</p> Yes, he worked all day long"
1000122436.txt,So I went back into the living room and I was very upset and that was the first night I slept in another room.
1000122436.txt,I feel like there's so much.
1000122436.txt,I'm just getting to where I don't feel like I'm on a trail here.
1000122436.txt,I was just frustrated with the situation and he was the closest person.
1000122436.txt,"He is very on top of me, especially when I'm not feeling good."
1000122436.txt,"I had written Carlos a letter because he was living in Bogot�, kind of explaining how I felt about him and wondering because it always felt like there was something mutual with him, and just wondering what was going on with that."
1000122436.txt,But at that point I didn't want to make the decision because I felt like my father would just be so disappointed in me.
1000122436.txt,"I was scared, too."
1000122436.txt,But this is how I feel about it.
1000122436.txt,"I feel like maybe that's even what you're going for."""
1000122436.txt,"And then she got involved with this person and I felt pretty abandoned, pretty bad, because I was pretty depressed at that point too."
1000122436.txt,I would have felt horrible.</p> I would have felt like I was a big disappointment to my father.
1000122436.txt,"And I talked to Trish downstairs, and when I came back upstairs I felt like there was something weird in his tone of voice, like he was like, ""Are you talking to Trish?"""
1000122436.txt,He's upset with me.
1000122436.txt,"I mean probably, to be honest, which I am embarrassed to say so, I didn't really know what to expect and at first and you called and you were a man, I was like, ""Oh God, it is a man."""
1000122436.txt,"I mean, I'm not a nut case with men, but I'm definitely very nervous around men."
1000122436.txt,"and I think at that point I started to feel depressed. I didn't quite know if I wanted to be in Chicago, or if I wanted to go somewhere else."
1000122436.txt,"I feel kind of funny. I'm just like, ""I don't know what I'm talking about."
1000122436.txt,"I don't know, I just feel funny. [giggles] I'm just nervous, because I've been in therapy before but it has always been with the same therapist."
1000122436.txt,"[giggles] I'm just nervous, because I've been in therapy before but it has always been with the same therapist. That I've had since I was fifteen years old."
1000122436.txt,"I just felt like I need to break from the past a little bit and move on. Because he knows me and he knows my family, my mother had been in therapy with him."
1004687726.txt,"And it's hard to tell the difference between what I think and what I'm feeling, or what I'm—[00:12:29]</p>"
1004687726.txt,Because I never felt (pause)—I never felt like my opinion wasn't as good as the teacher's.
1004687726.txt,"Like, I'm, like, truly embarrassed at how bad I am at it, but I just—I failed every single quiz in fourth grade geography."
1004687726.txt,"Just, like, feeling like I was somebody who could do this."
1004687726.txt,"I think he's severely, severely depressed and (pause), you know, I think I was just one of the things that slipped his mind.</p>"
1004687726.txt,But I'm not embarrassed to talk about it at all.
1004687726.txt,"You know, the way that we think about it and talk about it, there's like—there's just two categories, and I don't feel like I'm really in either."
1004687726.txt,"It does feel like what's actually there, I'm really not happy about it."
1004687726.txt,"And I have—I feel like, I spent the last few days being like, ""OK, I know I didn't get this job. These are all the reasons why that's a good thing,"" and so forth and so on."
1004687726.txt,I feel like I've been trying to have a shorter commute for two years. And it's finally going to happen.
1004687726.txt,"Because I never felt (pause)—I never felt like my opinion wasn't as good as the teacher's. Just that, the teacher's a lot more experienced than I was, you know."
1004687726.txt,"Like, I'm, like, truly embarrassed at how bad I am at it, but I just—I failed every single quiz in fourth grade geography. I would just get zero after zero after zero after zero, and the teacher was this, like, (laughs)—she was like, probably mid-forties at the time, like 5'10"", very tall, very thin, kind of a (inaudible at 20:07)."
1004687726.txt,"Like, I would just cry, and cry, and cry, and feel so stupid and so ashamed, and she would humiliate me in public, you know, in front of the other kids. And, you know, she was definitely a, like, you know—it was one of those hard-line, take-no-prisoners kind of high stakes approaches, and I think those are effective to some degree, but, like, they—you know, it was just really bad."
1004687726.txt,"I think he's severely, severely depressed and (pause), you know, I think I was just one of the things that slipped his mind.</p> I mean, also that was the way he was raised."
1004687726.txt,"I don't feel like, you know, I don't know, (inaudible at 40:35).</p> (laughs) Again, with the continuity.</p> That may be a convincing argument."
1004687726.txt,"You know, the way that we think about it and talk about it, there's like—there's just two categories, and I don't feel like I'm really in either. And so far, I mean that I want to say, ""Yes, this was really bad."""
1004687732.txt,"He has really asked me and has always pushed me to call other friends also, and that part of the conversation I just really didn't feel good about."
1004687732.txt,I can't tell how much of that is me pushing back against taking up emotional space and how much of this is me feeling like—there is kind of a resentment for me at the end of it and I don't know how much that was justified.
1004687732.txt,"It's really good that I have all of these people who really care about me, but I feel like it's making all of my relationships into relationships that are really just centered around me."
1004687732.txt,I feel like the depression is everything that I am.
1004687732.txt,I guess this shame was something I had heard but never been on the same side as.
1004687732.txt,I do need to feel like I'm somebody outside of him.
1004687732.txt,I need to not get sucked in too far to feeling like I'm completely dependent on him.
1004687732.txt,Part of me is angry at him for not listening to me or . . .
1004687732.txt,"At the same time, I knew he was really angry, so it didn't go well."
1004687732.txt,I am really grateful for that but I also worry that it's going to be too much for him and that I shouldn't just tell me what I need.
1004687732.txt,"I was kind of afraid to say, ""I think we do owe Brad that same loyalty."""
1004687732.txt,It's one of the things I feel I'm lucky to have.
1004687732.txt,"Then it's both ""I should do this better"" and ""I am so angry at her."""
1004687732.txt,"Can we talk a little bit about what you mean when you say ""taking up emotional space""? It's one of the things that I thought I knew what you meant when you first said it and the first several times, and it seems you use it in categories that make me think I don't necessarily understand what you're talking about."
1004687732.txt,"It's not entirely clear to me, like what we were talking about yesterday of me being loyal to people and also anxious about them. But I can't remember exactly how anxious is related to not wanting to dump on people in my life."
1004687732.txt,"He has really asked me and has always pushed me to call other friends also, and that part of the conversation I just really didn't feel good about. I can't tell how much of that is me pushing back against taking up emotional space and how much of this is me feeling like—there is kind of a resentment for me at the end of it and I don't know how much that was justified."
1004687732.txt,"It's really good that I have all of these people who really care about me, but I feel like it's making all of my relationships into relationships that are really just centered around me. [00:07:29] It's very easy for me to talk about myself always, and then I talk about myself for five minutes"
1004687732.txt,"But they are afraid, maybe, to talk about other things. I feel like the depression is everything that I am."
1004687732.txt,"I feel like the depression is everything that I am. That makes it harder when I talk to other people, and it seems to me like they think the depression is everything I am also."
1004687732.txt,"It's still an emotional journey, but it's a comfortable one and one that I know what's going to happen. David Foster Wallace's Brief Interviews with Hideous Men was a book that was good for me to read, even though it did, I think, send me off into several days of mess because he's ultimately a really hopeful writer."
1004687732.txt,"For him, he needs some kind of emotional independence from his wife. [00:17:05] I think the line is, ""All that I ask for is one little corner, one tiny room at the back of my heart."

1004687732.txt,I do need to feel like I'm somebody outside of him. It's way more of a problem for Cathy than it is for me.
1004687732.txt,"I need to not get sucked in too far to feeling like I'm completely dependent on him. [00:20:49] Right now it's a problem in that the things that he said, ""It's okay for you to lean on me in this way,"" even though I've said, ""This is going to be really hard on you."
1004687732.txt,"Yeah, but more I feel bad for having believed him but recognize that it should be, ""Well, okay, I'll lean a little less now."" Like none of this is necessary, you know?"
1004687732.txt,In some ways I feel like Marla had to get out when she was really young and build a person and a life for herself early. I think in some ways she is less damaged than us; or more healed.
1004687732.txt,"I don't know how much of it is the kind of guilt that I recognize as not actually good and how much of it is ""that is not what I think family means"". I don't know how I will ever be able think about my mom and not have that stab of feeling guilty."
1004687732.txt,"I don't know how I will ever be able think about my mom and not have that stab of feeling guilty. Every time she crosses my mind I'm like, ""I should do this better,"" or ""I am failing her,"" except for when I'm actually around her."
1004824655.txt,"(Sigh), I mean you say, you said that you felt that I'd been more confrontational."
1004824655.txt,I feel like it's a way of blaming me.</p>
1004824655.txt,I'm not worried about the why I'd be doing these particular things.

1004824655.txt,well I mean I guess what I'm trying to say though is that I had some sort of baseline clarity that allowed me think through what I was feeling in a way that is difficult when I'm feeling really distressed.
1004824655.txt,"No I am not—</p> (Chuckles), all right, down the rabbit hole, so I mean, I'm not though."
1004824655.txt,"[00:01:33]</p> (Pause), and I also felt like you were kind of tacking in our, (pause), you were trying out a new tack and you were not owning up to it. It was kind of a—</p>"

1004824655.txt,"I feel like it's a way of blaming me.</p> Now, that's probably not the best way of setting things up, in the sense that, (pause), well each of them has a trap imbedded in it."
1004824655.txt,"I'm not worried about the why I'd be doing these particular things. I think it's probably whatever, but (pause), they can assert themselves."
1004824655.txt,"It feels to me as if in some instances, they can assert themselves without, (pause), necessarily being provoked by some specific kind of cognition or some specific kind of, (pause) anxiety.</p> It has to be dealt with.</p>"

1004824655.txt,"So on the one hand, (pause), I do feel this resistance, and I think I was giving voice to it on Friday as well, in maybe a little less worked out form. On the other hand, it is kind of notable that A. I felt this very strong sense of well-being—</p>"

1000013364.txt,no I think last week I was a little upset at the-after that session because I was getting into what I thought was some interesting stuff
1000013364.txt,"But other than that, no I'm still so incredibly pleased with the way my mood is so much better, more optimistic and upbeat and hopeful even."
1000013364.txt,"I think I was upset last time and okay, but life has its upsetting moments"
1000013364.txt,and I think this is helping me get somewhere is that I can be upset with a woman without it becoming a big deal.</p>

1000013364.txt,"All right, well that's-I think I may feel like that's really a-that's really"
1000013364.txt,"and I had one observation, I was filling out the forms, I was thinking about some of last week's session and I notice when we got into-I mean it's a couple of weeks in a row, we got into issues, we're going down one path and then we come back or your questioning comes back to feelings about my mother and it was a little, to me"
1000013364.txt,"and then we come back or your questioning comes back to feelings about my mother and it was a little, to me I guess it was a little disappointing."
1000013364.txt,"But other than that, no I'm still so incredibly pleased with the way my mood is so much better, more optimistic and upbeat and hopeful even. That if these same circumstances, the trouble on the deals, the trouble-the little bit of trouble in the relationship with Jemma had come about before our therapy had started, and then again, the wild cards, the Paxil as well.</p>"
1000013364.txt,"Well she's picking up on how-it's been this issue of my relationship with Skyler that is always a little bit unclear to me and Jemma, very quickly, very smartly picks up that I feel very, very, very close to Skyler, primarily because of the fact that she's Madison's mother and the only person taking care of Madison. And so I just am enormously beholden to her and appreciative of her parenting efforts and she's done a wonderful job"
1000013364.txt,"Yeah, we just never-we talk from time to time about writing something down, I guess partly because my income has been so uncertain and she's worked and not worked"
1000013364.txt,and I'm glad that she's raising it because I think she's-I don't feel defensive about it. I think it's about-</p>
1000013364.txt,"I think I was upset last time and okay, but life has its upsetting moments but I think the place-I think that where I'm growing and enjoying life more and enjoying the interactions that I'm having with you"
1000013364.txt,"and I think this is helping me get somewhere is that I can be upset with a woman without it becoming a big deal.</p> That was-yes, that could that, that led to that, exactly."
1000013364.txt,"Well the more important thing is-or the business about, I mean I knew that one of the objectives of the research was to kind of-was to-I could see that the forms test or ask me questions about how I'm feeling, about the relationship with my therapist and how I'm projecting what the therapist is feeling about me. So it's not something that-so I'm aware of that when I fill out the forms at the end of the session."
1000013364.txt,"and I guess maybe what I'm saying is maybe, this maybe betrayed a feeling about me as the kind of guy that would do that. Which leads me to wonder, are you-</p>"
1000013364.txt,"All right, well that's-I think I may feel like that's really a-that's really I think at the heart of a lot of what's at the essence of a lot of my issues I think."

1000013370.txt,Either smooth out some of the wrinkles in my current life which is essentially what I feel I've accomplished in our time together.
1000013370.txt,"I'm much less sad, depressed."
1000013370.txt,Well I'd be afraid I'd be exploited.</p>
1000013370.txt,And I kind of was then in the uncomfortable position of not really wanting to take her money but not really feeling that I could spend the money on my own.
1000013370.txt,So it's then I'm worried that maybe my emotions will get the better of me and I'll be more antagonistic.
1000013370.txt,"And it's because I'm, and that's why I try to, that's why again, so many mixed, conflicted feelings towards women.</p>"
1000013370.txt,"And a lot more of a sense of kind of looking (inaudible at 0:01:09.2) or felt awarenesses of what's going on.

1000013370.txt,Either smooth out some of the wrinkles in my current life which is essentially what I feel I've accomplished in our time together. I'm much less apoplectic.
1000013370.txt,"I'm much less sad, depressed. Less thrown by dealing with women.</p>"
1000013370.txt,So I kind of felt a little bit exploited. But then you know it was offset by a real genuine sense that Jemma really is not in this relationship just for whatever dinners I can take her to or vacations I can take her on.
1000013370.txt,"How to really take care of what's important to me and protecting myself against the fear of exploitation. But doing it in the face of, and what I used before with you as kind of gracious way, a way that's tactful, that doesn't seem to [snibble] (ph) in there, to-"
1000013370.txt,I just feel I'm wasting my time. You're wasting your money here.
1000013370.txt,And I imagine making you feel uncomfortable. Let's go to our separate worlds for X number of days or weeks or whatever.
1000013370.txt,See how it feels to be out of each other's lives for awhile.</p> I think where I get myself into trouble is that maybe I'm not as quick and nimble a responder.
1000013370.txt,"And it's because I'm, and that's why I try to, that's why again, so many mixed, conflicted feelings towards women.</p> It's so hard."
1000013370.txt,"I don't feel, I've described this kind of love/hate relationship that I have.</p> So I think it's a mixture."
1000013370.txt,But it makes me nervous in my relationships with women whether I'm appearing to be oblivious of the fact. It was one of those guys who just doesn't get it as they said a few years ago.

1000017880.txt,"And this is one reason I kind of feel like I'm not really so unattractive, because like I would say the majority of his clients, they come in, always compliment him on me, and like one of them said that he wanted - I said, guess I said, ""Do you want, does Mr. ..."" - whatever his name was, Mr. Czarski - ""...is he going to take anything with him or does he want to take any of this, anything with him?"""

1000017880.txt,it took me a long time to sit down with myself and realize that like...that's the way life is.
1000017880.txt,and I never realized it was out there because I guess maybe I was a little bit scared to discover it for a long time.
1000017880.txt,Don't give me the excuse you're afraid that he's going to be hurt...because you can do it in such a way that it's nice and he won't be hurt.

1000017880.txt,I almost feel like it's not necessary anymore.
1000017880.txt,But it's not like I feel like I have to eat.
