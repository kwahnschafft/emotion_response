1004564943.txt,"So we had a family breakfast this morning at school. I get there and I'm even running a little late and my family's not there. Jess had a flat tire. But Ian won an award at school.</p> I don't know. You misbehave a lot in the beginning of the school year and then - one year in summer camp I won an award and that was one of three major awards, one of them was Best Behavior and I was in the running for that. And they said that I would probably be happier winning the other award. It's a big trophy but I was pretty embarrassed by it. So you just - for four weeks up you beat up other kids for four weeks and then you stop beating them up for another four weeks and you win the award. There was really only one kid and I didn't beat him up, just hit him once or twice. I said don't cross this line.</p> He crossed it. I was also being encouraged by the counselor.</p> So, yes. You ask after four weeks you could. Didn't fit in. So, Jess, I gave all of her the opportunity to do all the IRS paperwork and it hasn't been done yet. And I gave her all the information she wanted from me two days ago. And she has a brief that was due last Friday that she's been working on. And I think Monday's the day that the bank releases the funds. [00:02:11]</p> And I texted her. I said I forgot to ask you about the IRS paperwork. She's like oh I'm still working on my brief. And then she said if you could pick up Ian, I would have more time, a couple more hours. And I told her yesterday that I have a closing today at one. Cutting it kind of close. I'm in Wakefield at 1:00 doing a closing and I get to Plymouth at 2:30 to pick him up. So I said why are you bringing it up again? She's like, what did she say? She says she didn't mean it to be inflammatory. She's just saying she's got more things to do than time. And I replied I had a side to the same problem. And I explained to her that that was two months rent. And I spent another month's rent on the new office and that leaves me three months' rent in the hole. And she replied that she'd try to get the paperwork to her lawyer today. So I guilted her into it. I still think it's too late. I don't know even if they receive the money if they'll return it.</p> Yes, so I really saw this as an opportunity to either meet and/or get the name of the person I needed to call or e-mail about how do I get back on the closing list. And they wanted people's opinions, that's what the Community Board does is it advises. So this general practice lawyer from, I don't even remember where he's from - or something like that - just started laying into them about opting in and just all this paperwork they got at the beginning. And the CEO answered that they had to do it for most likely for regulatory reasons, but people just started going around the table ripping them. Just - and I was kind of shocked I mean but that's what they wanted to hear. [00:08:03]</p> I don't know where it came from but I just was like - so that was kind of good. She said she doesn't know if it was a closed list or open list so there's no guarantee. They're interested in my critiques of the bank. This isn't about getting me signed up to do closings. But this is my opportunity to, if I'm going to get closings, this is my shot.</p> An open list means that they're adding attorneys or they're letting - will let attorneys - if an attorney refers someone to the bank, that attorney can do the closing. But even on a closed list you still can get on. I'm kind of fudging it by saying that I referred business to the Bank. I did but not a whole lot. the Bank had pretty high standards so it wasn't easy to get a loan from them unless you had perfect credit, perfect income, everything worked out right. But I did have some one or two clients who needed a bank and went and talked to a mortgage broker. You mention mortgage broker and they freak out. So I referred them to one of the loan officers there. [00:10:44]</p> Yes. And so I was a little flustered and it's just another one of these things like I kind of - my days are just so, they're so disjointed and I'm not sure what I should be doing. I get up to the office in Pembroke and I don't have a desk and shit's everywhere and I don't know where stuff is. I feel like I've got more work to do than I really have and, I don't know. Just, I'm just all over the place. I'm being pulled in kind of a lot of different directions at once.</p> Yes. It always ends the same way. We want to find a way to keep you in your house. You want to find a way for me to keep sending you money is what you want to do. Nothing's getting rectified and I'm probably going to be making money and I'm basically going to be paying Jess's bills. My health insurance in June is going up from $1220 to $1500 and something.</p> Yes. It's like they're talking about how nobody's health insurance premiums are going out, everything's working out. There's new cost control measures and what not. Then why is mine going up 20 percent? [00:18:12]</p> It's just ridiculous. When I first started this health insurance, and this was a family plan, it was $600 and something, no deductible. I'm now on a deductible plan and the copays were only $10. That was six years ago. This is unfucking real. I haven't even told Jess about that. It's a mess. Just...</p> Yes, it's like a band-aid on an open wound. I did ride my bike to Handball last night, though. I was sore getting up this morning.</p> It was okay. I'm really having problems with my throws. My shoulder was fucked up last year so that's really affected how I throw. I don't know. It's just exercise. Keep me from having a hard time. Lose all this weight I've been put on. I downloaded all my transactions; it was McDonalds, McDonalds, McDonalds, McDonalds, McDonalds. I'm like I eat a lot of fucking McDonalds. No wonder I'm so fat. You don't eat McDonalds; you're thin. You also work out. Probably some good spinning classes, to power yoga.</p> Pilates?</p> Have a personal trainer?</p> Kelly Ripa does. According to her interview in Good Housekeeping.</p> Yes. Few days a week.</p> I felt bad like this morning. I'm reading the magazines in your waiting room...</p> I've got a closing at 1:00; I still don't have my docs. They haven't approved my HUD, they made changes to the HUD; I've got to make those changes and send it to them. You know, it's just nothing's coming easy. Nothing. She told me over an hour ago that I'd have them in 45 minutes. Maybe they've come through. I don't know. Please remove the lender credit; that was my error in applying this. Please resend HUD for approval. Fucking 24 hours later she picks up her mistake and I don't get the docs until she gets her thing. Fuck. At least I didn't have any mistakes. [00:22:11]</p> Yes, so I have to...</p> Well they have, again, they haven't - they won't send those to me until they approve the settlement statement, the numbers. So I had to get that HUD approved and then they'll send me a link to the documents, which I have to print out. And I've got to swing by Staples to make copies for the borrower, all within an hour and a half, basically.</p> Well I print them out in the office, but then I've got to go and make copies for the borrower, because they're going to sign and I'm going to keep those. So it's just - if I'm running too late I'll just tell them at the table I can scan these and e-mail them to you, or I can overnight documents, I don't know. They never make it easy.</p> Some of them will send the docs knowing that he just needs to make one small change, but I don't know if she's going to do that or not. These banks, they suck. They totally suck. They all suck, they really do. Everyone's gone out of business, there's only a handful of lenders left. That's why if I get these closings, they're probably like the other Bank, much easier, you know what to expect, and you get the docs well in advance of closing.</p> At least the borrower's at home. So if I'm late I can call him and say hey I'm late. I'm not meeting him, sitting in my office or whatever. They're at home watching Kelly Ripa.</p> Yes, and her kids, reading habits. I was working for a firm. There were times I'd stress out about it, then I just got to the point where I didn't care anymore so I didn't stress out about being late. But it's hard for me to not stress out about being late because I've got to make up a lie. I can't call up and say hey the lender fucked up and didn't give me the documents until just a moment ago. I'll say oh there were some technical problems and they were late giving me the docs and I'm putting them together now. That's where the - if they were meeting me at the office then it wouldn't be a problem because I don't have to worry about travel time. But I've got to travel. One of the options is to scan all the documents and print them out, instead of trying to go to Staples. That might be - work better. [00:26:15]</p> I can reprint them out and try and - the thing is they're not all...</p> I could, but it's not like they just print you - they print to - it's more than just...</p> Yes. I probably will do that. I've done it like that before. I don't know. Just they suck. Totally suck. Hopefully soccer gets rained out today. We're having a soccer party afterwards. I have a title that's due today that I haven't had a chance to really even start. Probably has to do that tomorrow. Soccer hopefully gets cancelled. I've got a birthday party, a Cinco de Mayo birthday party to go to.</p> Grown up party. Bar-be-queing, [inaudible at 00:27:27]. Yes, really sketchy place.</p> Hip, trendy, your neighbors live in a crack house, yes.</p> I don't know. It's like from outside it's like a nice, triple-decker, condos all fixed up. And then there's a crack house right next to it. It's like trendy bar, barbershop. Money hashing place, trendy bar, seedy chiropractor, fast food Chinese place. You just look inside and you're like I wouldn't eat. There'll be another trendy bar. Really bizarre. And then there's cop cars whizzing by every moment with their sirens on, the occasional gunshot - okay there's no gunshots but... [00:28:42]</p> A woman I play Handball with. Her name's I'Hara, they call her Harry; I call her Harry. Cinco de Harry.</p> Yes. Very...</p> Yes. So I'll eat hotdogs, drink more than I should. [Phone rings] Who do you think that is?</p> Oh God, I just want to go to sleep. I want to just - and I can't because of the fucking dog, I can't lie in bed. And I mean now getting up early doesn't make a difference. He's already pissed and shit all over the place. I think the vet's coming next week. And this new medication has something to do with it because his poops are looser and they're different and he's peeing differently and... [00:30:08]</p> [inaudible at 00:30:11] anxiety. He's on some tricyclic antidepressant, Chloromapazine (ph) or something like that, Chloromapazine (ph). I don't know...</p> I was thinking about start taking some of see what happens - if it helped me. Probably shouldn't do that though.</p> He seems like much calmer now. When he used to see dogs he'd just, he start going nuts. Now he just whines a little bit and he still gets aggressive with dogs but he's much more calm. But he still - I hear a door slam and he starts shaking and just - and the kids downstairs, the daughter's plaything violin and the mom's helping the daughter practice her violin and the younger kid who has trouble speaking is going mama, mama, mama, mama. And I have no TV so I can't even drown it out. Mama, mama, mama, (humming), mama, mama, mama. And I can't complain about anything because I'm three months behind in rent.</p> Is there?</p> I just put the headphones on and listen to music, NPR, some sports talk radio, or white noise. Yes, Jess has a machine for Lucille, which puts her to sleep. That's weird. Oh God. They need more information from me. It ain't getting fucking done today. I don't know why she didn't ask me for this shit all at once. She wants tax returns, insurance policy stuff... [00:32:45]</p> Yes. Fucking money's gone, fucking forget about it. Take your time; let them levy your accounts again. I mean when am I supposed to fucking do that today? I've got a closing, then fucking soccer practice, then a fucking after-soccer practice game. Tomorrow I've got soccer games, then I've got to do this work thing. Just - the tax returns are at the apartment so I've got to swing by the apartment at some point, get them to the office to scan them or give them to her. It's not getting done today. It's just fucked up. I wonder why the IRS would be asking be asking for the fucking tax returns. They have them. Go into your little computer there and pull them up. They're there.</p> I'm completely convinced that Tuesday's going to be a complete waste of my time. Because this is just how everything goes. Just...</p> Yes.</p> Thanks. Is that what the book says?</p> Doesn't the law of attraction have something to do with this? Like I'm attracted to negativity so that's why everything's negative in my life?</p> I'm not really sure about the law, what the law of attraction is but...</p> Oh God.</p> What should give me a reason to think that something's going to go right? I mean even if something does go right, something else is going to offset it. I can't have a moment of success or anything without something completely getting in the way of it.</p> Yes, it's not possible. If it was possible it would've happened by now. But I've been in a rut that literally can circle the Earth five times. It's one big-assed rut.</p> It just keeps getting deeper and deeper and deeper and harder and harder to pull out of. Do you need to do some research on this one?</p> Just think positive and positive things will happen.</p> That's what Jess would say. She would say something like that.</p> I'm like a dog who sits in the doghouse and there's a cat and the cat just draws a line. And I start running r-r-r-r-rump. And the chain tightens up and I'm boom, right in front of the cat; can't get the cat. And the cat's just sitting there, smoking a cigarette, looking at it's nails, drinking tea... [00:38:24]</p> You've seen those cartoons.</p> They don't make them like that any more. I don't know if kids today are going to about these (inaudible) or something. I feel like Wile E. Coyote. Can't catch that damn Roadrunner. How I survived an anvil being dropped on my head, though, I do not know.</p> I don't know what they are. It's just how it is. All this time she could've fucking asked me for. Oh come on. She's bugging the fuck out of me. Shit, I just don't have time to get things that everybody needs.</p> Yes. I should go.</p>",0
1000133869.txt,"I see they're graduating today.</p> Oh two days of graduations. Why's that?</p> Oh I see. I see. And the undergrads the next?</p> Oh. That's nice.</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p> Mm.</p> Well no I found one. </p> Yeah right. I'd seen the robes before but I never could identify where they were from. Now I know.</p> You know the maroon with the-</p> Yeah right. </p> Oh I see. I see.</p> Do they still wear the same-</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p> I always kind of thought the beret things were neat. (Laughs)</p> (laughing) I don't know. I guess basically I'm a sentimental traditionalist. (Laughs) Or something. </p> Yeah I think it's really nice. I don't see why anybody would knock graduation or something like that.</p> I did too.</p> Yeah yeah. I thought it was really kind of nice myself also. Somebody says, ""Oh hell. Who wants to go?"" And all this stuff. ""Why should you go?"" It's because I'm graduating. That's why. (Laughing) After all that work there ought to be some sort of pomp and circumstance. (Laughs)</p> Really. But I don't know. What did you read in the papers there is a 16 year old valedictorian who got up and said, ""That it was like 13 years of babysitting. That's all you ever did for me."" [0:02:12.2]</p> She says, ""When we ask about birth control you say that you can't mention it. And we asked about dope and you send us to a policeman. You don't send a doctor.""</p> And she says, ""We're not insane. We're not crazy. And we're your children."" It was really kind of nice. I thought, ""Wow."" She really hit the nail on the head. Thirteen years of babysitting. </p> But at any rate. Graduation is nice. I remember when I graduated from high school it was like I was-you know graduated from high school. And usually the family would have a big party for you or something.</p> Like my father said, ""No. You just got out of high school. It's no big deal."" And I was really pissed. Really upset about the whole thing. So my mother said to me, ""When you make it out of college. You know, ha ha. We'll just throw a big party. We'll rent a hall. And have a band. And the whole bit."" I made it out of college and she never has yet thrown a party. (Laughs) I'm still waiting for the party. But I kind of remembered those things while working through college. </p> Yeah right. When I get married then the big party will come. I'll end up paying for it. (Chuckles) Because like I was the first one out of college.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah right. Like out of anybody. But at any rate. (Inaudible) I went home to change after work. And it was really funny that I got a call from this guy who I met in Chicago when I was there last summer. And we had sex together, you know. And he was kind of nice. And we went and saw Chicago together. </p> But it felt kind of good to say it. I just said, ""Goodbye."" But he would've been a nice person to know in a straight basis. He was a big man in H.E.W. Health, education and welfare. He would've gotten me a nice job I'm sure. (Laughs) </p> Oh no. No way. But like he would've been a nice person to know. Like-</p> Yeah right. As straight.</p> Yeah right. You know one of those people.</p> Mm-hmm. Really. Like I said he can call from Portland. (Laughs) </p> So. Then I thought, I was really glad that I did say no. Even because I would've had to say no even if he did come into New York. If he was making a special trip to New York. I thought, ""Sh*t."" It would be kind of waste of his time. And mine unless he gave me a job. (Laughs) Because he did mention the last time when I saw him Chicago that he could've gotten me some job or something like that. And those are nice jobs to have. (Laughs) [0:06:26.8]</p> It's civil service. </p> I don't know what you do. But like all I know is you travel a lot. </p> Right. Right. He flies to Alaska and flies all over. I could dig it. (Laughs) But that's life. And that other guy called me. This is something else. I don't why. Like just now. All these people-</p> Yeah they're all showing up. Like wow. That other guy, Thomas Delcroy, he's the guy who had me in-</p> Yeah right. The gas.</p> Yeah right. And he called again. And he said-he wanted to know where I was during the storm last Sunday. And I said, ""Well I was in bed. And matter of fact I was in bed with a fine young lady."" (Chuckling) I said, ""If you want to know the truth."" He says, ""Oh?"" And I said, ""Yeah."" And he says, ""Oh I see."" And I said, ""Yep."" And he says something about you don't plan. Something about the two way or something like this. And I said, ""Oh no. When I go, I go all the way."" </p> And it was really kind of funny talking to him too. (Laughing) Just saying all this stuff. And I think like he asked-we sat and conversed about nothing. For the rest of the time. He was really-I think he was kind of floored. To tell you the truth.</p> Right. Right. And he says, ""Oh I suppose you'll get married and have children. And all this stuff."" And I said, ""Yeah."" I said, ""Oh we'll have to have lunch sometime. Or go out for dinner. Something like that."" Sit and talk for awhile. He says, ""Yeah."" So that was the end of it. It's really weird. It really was weird.</p> Yeah right. You like haven't heard from these guys in like years or something like this. But it's really kind of grand just to say, ""Well, sorry. Goodbye."" [0:08:32.5]</p> No it doesn't. It doesn't even bother me. </p> Yeah right. Right.</p> Uh-uh. There isn't anything (inaudible at 0:08:51.5) like this. Not even. No second thoughts about it or anything like that. So that's nice. You have to go out and buy all these storage boxes?</p> Oh. </p> Oh so they were getting rid of the boxes.</p> Oh. You ripped off of them at any rate.</p> (laughs)</p> That's great. (Laughs)</p> That's right. Really. Hell of a lot easier. That's grand. It's like - Mr. Heiman, who is the art consultant, they had some voting booths out in the hall. They were going to use for senior. We were thinking of ripping off a couple. But-</p> Yeah right. It's a federal offense or something. They were just cardboard though. But we ultimately ended up going through it legally and calling the man. And he going down to the warehouse and picking up the used voting booths. But uh - </p> Cardboard. Yeah.</p> No no no. Not the curtain ones. The cardboard ones. Yeah. But this man-</p> Right. Mr. Heiman was saying that they put new sod in front of this new high school. I think it was [Desabo] or something like that. Or Dunbar. They put new sod. One morning new sod in front of the high school. The next morning he drives by and there's new sod on the other side of the street in front of all these people's homes. (Laughing) They all had beautiful sod. </p> Really. I think it was terrific. They never had grass before. They have it now. Courtesy of. [0:10:29.9]</p> It was nice. It really turned out well. Comparatively. It was kind of hectic. This afternoon at lunchtime the two women, my two team mates, were on tranquilizers so I decided-I never had one before, you know?</p> So I joined them in a tranquilizer. It was very relaxing. It really was. Like wow. It was like, I just sat there and watched the play. And nothing bothered me. (Laughs) Didn't even get up out of the seat. It was really kind of nice. And they really-I didn't. They just kind of relax you that's all. </p> Like I don't know what else they're supposed to do.</p> Yeah right. It was really, really kind of nice. I don't know if I'd make a habit out of it though. Just you know if you have to depend upon tranquilizers things are getting pretty bad. Oh. </p> A little bit. A little bit. Not too. I went to bed early last night. I called Tanya. She was in kind of a bit**y mood. Kind of a blah mood. And I wasn't.</p> And I said, ""Well what's wrong with you?"" And she said, ""I don't know."" And I just felt like hanging up. (Chuckles) You know like what's the sense of going on talking if the conversation is going to be so strained. </p> Yeah right. You just kind of (makes clicking noise). But I don't know. I ended up talking to her but it was kind of like really kind of blah.</p> Right. Right. Not at least whatever I was looking for. (Laughing) You know?</p> But because I was feeling kind of good at that point. And then I thought to myself, ""Well we all have our bad moments."" Including I. So imagine she feels the same way if I'm in rather a lousy mood. [0:12:39.8]</p> Yeah right. Do anything or you know. So I just thought it happens to everybody. It's getting around to the end of the year. And getting all this stuff together. Something I'm not looking forward to. (Chuckles) You know it's like doing report cards. And doing [cue] cards. And packing and all that stuff.</p> And just really kind of a pain in the a**. And what do you do with 31 children while you're trying to get all the rest of this stuff done. I wish I could just go home and stay. We tried that once but they all showed up. (Laughs)</p> Telling them to stay home. (Laughs)</p> We did. Truthfully. I think it was the last day before Christmas or something. We weren't going to do anything. It's just like it's just going to be getting things together to go on the Christmas break. Just throwing subtle hints like, ""Oh I imagine you have some last minute shopping to do. And your mother would like to take you shopping. Don't strain yourself to come."" But they all came. (Laughs) </p> We were practically giving you a written invitation to stay home. Mm. Some of the kids I had in 7th and 8th grade they came back from another school to see the play. God like it's this new person. They've all developed. They've all passed puberty now. [0:14:30.1]</p> It's just like I didn't even recognize half of them. </p> Oh wow. Twice as tall as you are. And it's really a weird feeling.</p> Yeah right before that age. And then-</p> Uh-huh. They just-oh it was unbelievable. I had this one kid. I didn't even know who he was. I couldn't-And I had him like only two years ago. He was so different. He was so scrawny and little and now he's just so big. It really makes a hell of a difference. It was kind of nice though to see them. They come up and say hello and all this stuff. This one girl though. Shawna she used to give me hell. You know?</p> But she was nice in her own way. And the teacher had to get her. And I said, ""Christ, she hasn't changed."" (Chuckles) The other one. Chyna. Oh God. She was really bright. Really bright. And she was bright enough to start trouble and stay out of it. And you know just really clever. </p> Really a clever girl. But she's, God in 8th grade now and sleeping with guys and carrying on. Unbelievable but she's got more brains. She's supposed to be going on to [Lindbloom]. Which really isn't a bad school. If she makes it. If she doesn't play, she'll be fine.</p> I mean she's the type that stuff that we were doing in grammar school, pfft. </p> You know. </p> Yeah she could play. She didn't have any hassle. She'd pass all the time. She could really have a good time. The whole thing wasn't challenging enough for her. [0:16:36.8]</p> She was. We were babysitting for her. We were. I think they'd have to just burn the whole system right now and start from scratch in order to really get down to teaching these kids what they really should learn. Burn it all. Oh. Only two more weeks left anyway. When are you leaving?</p> What's that the twenty-</p> 22nd. 23rd. Yeah. And have a place to stay and everything? Oh that's nice. </p> That's nice. </p> A house? Hey. (Chuckles)</p> Well. It's better than an apartment.</p> Like I mean did you have to get a lawnmower and all sorts of things?</p> And a shovel. For the snow.</p> That I don't know if I'd like. (Laughs) </p> Really that's the truth.</p> Uh-huh. </p> I did too.</p> (laughing) I remember when my brother and I, we used to let it grow so long. And it just-of course we never had a power mower. (Laughing) It was like the two of us. One would have to get on one side and one have to get on the other side and push because you could hardly get through it. It really was bad. (Laughs) I hope the neighborhood improvement association doesn't get after you for a shoddy lawn. (Laughing) </p> Oh good then they won't even notice. (Laughing) We used to always be trying to talk my father into putting in a cement yard. So we wouldn't have to cut the lawn. He never did though.</p> Mm. You know. Nothing.</p> Yeah right. Right. It really looks bad. </p> Uh-huh. Yeah they are.</p> Right. If you'd like to take care of them. </p> Oh yeah. Probably.</p> (Laughing) Something you can rip off of it. I really can't-I guess a lot of people must enjoy it. It's really - . There was this like the one witch who used to live in the block. And in the fall whenever her lawn she used to take it. Because there was always one. She was really weird. Come out and squirt you with a hose. Just antagonize you. So you'd just be more antagonistic towards her. (Chuckles) And then on the other hand there was this one man who used to live in the back. I mean we'd use his yard for a play area. We built a tree house up in his tree. [0:21:19.5]</p> He used to build little wooden carts for us with the wheels on it and stuff like that. Who was really a nice guy. I don't know if he was a bachelor or something. Lived with his sister. He was an old man. He used to have one of the cars with the running boards. And we used to hop on the running boards. </p> And during the winter we used to stand by stop signs and hitch the rides in back of the cars. And he'd always let us get on. Of course it was very dangerous. I realize that now. (Laughs) But he was really nice. And buy anything off of you. Whatever you were selling he'd buy it off of you. I always wondered-know what happened. I think he moved to Texas and retired. To Texas. I was wondering if Tanya was pissed about our last conversation. I'll have to ask her.</p> Yeah right. If she was upset about that. </p> Yeah right.</p> Yeah right. And she doesn't say. Like I said to her, ""Well what's happening like tonight?"" And she says, ""Well nothing really."" And I said well I had to come here and like I'd be through about 5:30 or so. And I said, ""Well do you want me to come by your place?"" ""Well I don't care."" </p> Yeah right.</p> Yeah right. And she says, ""Well if you'd want to."" Or stuff like this. </p> Yeah. And like I'm saying, ""Well whatever you want to do is fine with me. If you want to come this way or you want me to go that way. It really doesn't make that much difference."" And she'll never say well I really feel like coming over. And I'd-so fine. </p> Yeah right. And she said, ""No nothing."" Just. (Chuckles) It's like no, nothing. And you could really kind of tell there was something bothering her somewhere. And she just kind of (inaudible at 0:23:38.6). </p> Yeah right. Yeah right. Something. Some yes or no. Or tell me to go to hell. I don't care. Say something. It's just better than nothing. Which really drives me insane. Because you know that when a person is thinking something, and you know a person is thinking something, it really just drives me up a wall. It really does. [0:24:09.1]</p> ""We should only have two because it's getting a little crowded up there."" And she was kind of like apprehensive just letting the two go up there. </p> And I talked to her later and I said, ""If I said something that was kind of like offensive or you thought there should've been six or something, why don't you say something? If you would've said something."" And she said, ""You know me better than that. If had something to say; I'd say it."" Which is true. She would. She says, ""There were just so many other things on my mind that I just wasn't there. I was just kind of out of it."" Which is really kind of nice. And I was really kind of glad that I asked her about it. </p> Because I was feeling kind of rotten. I thought well did I say something wrong? </p> And Sara the other woman who works with us she was feeling kind of the same way. Because I asked her. ""Is there something wrong? Did we do something?"" And she said, ""No. She had troubles at home. And trying to run this thing and all that stuff."" But at least she explained. </p> Yeah. Wondering what's wrong. Or what did I do wrong? </p> Right. Right. What did I do wrong? Was there something that I said or did that's upsetting you so? If it is let me know. In fact I think I asked Tanya the same question last night if I'm not positive. </p> No. It was just like, ""No. Nothing. Nothing's wrong."" So I don't know. (Chuckles) You even ripped off with the tape, didn't you? [0:26:16.6]</p> (laughs) </p> Hey wow. (Laughing) </p> I can imagine. (Laughs) </p> Oh God.</p> Neither could I. </p> Uh-huh.</p> Oh you think you're-But teachers are unbelievable. </p> Oh God. They'll rip off of anything. If it's hanging on the wall they'll take it down. Really. And they may not even need it at that time. But oh I may need this later. </p> (laughing) And it's really unbelievable. Anything. Anything. Like one of the kids was talking about she was stealing something. She had stolen something. And she really didn't feel guilty about it. She had stolen something in old town she said. And she said, ""Well they gypped me. So I decided since they gypped me I was going to rip off something."" So she did. </p> Oh God. I was scared to death. Really. Just scared to death. He never did catch me. But I never would eat those candy bars. And I never stole anything again. </p> I never did. Really. I never went back there either. And I like I remember the kids saying, ""Christ you can't go back there for seven years. Because seven years is the time. They can catch you for seven years."" And I never went back into the store either. I did learn my lesson though. I would never, never steal anything again. These kids think nothing of it. Nothing at all. Going in there. In fact my mom (inaudible at 0:29:10.1). Young kids. Just little, like grammar school kids.</p> Into a cash register. You know, pfft, open up the cash register. Stole the money. (Chuckles) And think nothing of it. I thought, ""Christ."" But then I think as far as the parents are concerned that was always a big threat. If I ever hear you kids about stealing anything. Oh it was just like the biggest threat. If I hear you stealing anything. That and what was it? Hitting a girl. </p> That and hitting a girl. If I ever see you hit a girl. Because we couldn't. Even our sisters, it was like you don't. (Chuckles) You just don't. Which now I really can't see why. </p> Right. I really-that's it. Just always you respect them. And all this stuff. In fact I find it in the black community it's getting-they're really emphasizing the respect for their women. [0:30:31.5]</p> And it's a thing there wasn't much of before.</p> But it's really becoming out now. And don't you hit that girl. You must respect. She's a young woman. Blah blah blah. But I mean I can understand that as far as the boys are concerned. If some girl is going to come and slug me. I'd just slug them back. I was thinking about this weekend. And going to bed with Tanya. </p> And I thought I was really looking forward to it. First thoughts. Really looking forward to it. </p> Second thoughts. What if? (Chuckles)</p> What if I don't perform. </p> So I just have to keep in mind my first thoughts. </p> Yeah right.</p> Yeah right.</p> Right. I don't know. (Chuckles) Whatever you want to call it. </p> Right. Just really don't worry about it. But I thought to myself if my first thoughts are that I'm really going to enjoy it, well then I probably should.</p> Yeah. Yeah right. </p> And I'm really looking forward to it. Then it should-at least my first thoughts are first. Are you going to spend your weekend packing? [0:33:02.6]</p> (chuckling)</p> Oh. Still haven't finished your research, huh?</p> Uh. </p> Oh I see. </p> Oh I see. So then when you finish your paper you have to send it back to him?</p> Christ.</p> Well they wouldn't-</p> Go so far as saying rewrite the whole thing.</p> Oh. </p> Yeah. </p> Uh. Seems like a hell of a lot of to go through. I mean when you think about it. Christ. Especially getting the approval of four. You're bound to get one bas**rd. I would think.</p> Like who's going to say, ""Well forget it."" (Inaudible at 0:35:05.7)</p> (laughs) Yeah right. </p> Wow. </p> (laughs)</p> Yeah. I was going to say. Christ. That is unbelievable. And all right so you send your abstract, what if one doesn't approve your abstract?</p> Oh. </p> Oh. I see. </p> Mm-hmm.</p> (laughs)</p> Yeah I'd say.</p> If they don't hear anything it's okay.</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Wow. When do you plan-you'll graduate from here?</p> Wow. </p> (chuckles) Then after they're finished they stack them up at the new library.</p> (chuckling) Unreal. Unreal. God. Well it really means something though. I mean as far as if you have a degree from the NYU. Like the name itself, just wow. </p> You've got it. (Chuckles) As long as you have that piece of paper it's really kind of nice. </p> I was thinking it would be kind of nice-I mean if someone wrote each subject for a dissertation. About ten or twenty years from now seeing that most of the children of today both parents work. How that affects the child. </p> Yeah right. What happens to these children whose parents both worked at the same time? [0:38:13.0]</p> Yeah.</p> I don't know. I just thought it would really be interesting because from nursery school on. From, Christ, we had a couple of them and then the kids weren't even a year. And they were back to work. </p> And the kid is shipped out to a nursery school. Or a babysitter or something. And the mother has always worked. I thought it would really be interesting to find out-</p> Yeah the effects. The children. Because years ago, just in a curve. </p> But it was a-my mom always worked. Well she worked during the day since I was about nine or ten or something like that. And it was really kind of nice to come home and find her there. It was like a treat. </p> Yeah right. Yeah. Right. </p> Yeah right. It does that. You just have to do things for yourself because no one is going to do it for you. It's like going home at lunch time. And if she was home you'd have a nice lunch waiting for you. But you were home you made your own peanut butter and jelly sandwich. (Chuckles) And ran off to school. Which was about it. Which is really-that'd be interesting to find out. How these kids really turn out? We call them the key club. Because they always have keys around their necks. To get inside the door because no one is ever home. Maybe ten years from now I'll write a dissertation on it. (Laughing) [0:40:08.0]</p> Of course you have to find a control group and all sorts of things.</p> It would be kind of hard.</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah right. Right.</p> What would happen to them? I should start now. (Chuckles)</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah really. (Laughs) And what the hell good is it going to do after you're finished? </p> Uh-huh. Course. There's this-well one of the kids at the school he had a big part in the play. And his mother doesn't work. Oh Christ. Drive me up a wall. This is this Mrs. Mays. Again. Her child was in the play. Mrs. Mays was there during dress rehearsal taking pictures of her son.</p> She was there this morning. I mean, Christ. She was up on the stage. </p> On the stage. No getting her son ready for this act. </p> And Kathleen came up and she said to Jeanette, ""Do you think you need me?"" And Sara says, ""Oh no. Mrs. Augusto is right here. She could run this show."" Then she'd run down and get her movie camera and take the bright lights. And the kids just really resent him because of his mother. And it is so sad. Really sad. She was up here during dress rehearsal and she ripped off a couple of hangers that were in the room. And the kids, ""Mrs. Mays stole my hanger!"" (Laughs) I said, ""Well I'm sorry. We'll see if we can find you another one."" But it was really rotten for her to treat him like such a baby. Oh. It's like woman would you please leave and leave your son here alone? (Laughs) </p> And he'll turn out-I don't know how. She's strange. She's really weird. She married an Indian. Like-[0:42:21.1]</p> No. Indian. Indian. Indian. Indian. The kid looks Howdy Doody. (Laughs) He does. </p> No. He's really-it's sad. Because they tease him. And they say, ""Lloyd is your mother going to be here this afternoon?"" He says, ""No."" So. I think he'd just like to tell her to leave me alone. Just leave me alone. I guess it's getting better. I guess when he was like in fourth and fifth grade, she used to come and walk him to school everyday. (Laughs) And carry his briefcase and his musical instrument and everything else for him. If parents only knew. How they can ruin a child. That's how I was like trying to think about how my parents had an effect on me. It's nothing that I could really say. If they really did have an effect on me. They weren't around that often. </p> Just did they really have an effect on me? I imagine they'd have to. But there's nothing that I can really pinpoint and say, ""I'm this way because my parents.""</p> There really isn't anything that I can really say. Of course there are a number of psychologists that take that route, don't they? [0:44:24.6]</p> Yeah right. Try and pinpoint your parents and stuff. I mean they do. I mean sometimes you can really tell why a child is the way he is because of his parents.</p> But usually you just-</p> Yeah right. Right. I mean there's a few children you know. In fact the parents-just by meeting the parents you know why the kid is this way. </p> Why he's arrogant. Because his parents are arrogant. Why he's stupid? Because his parents tell he's stupid. (Chuckling)</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. It's really strange. Oh well. Should we call it?</p> Yeah. [0:45:33.3] [end of audio]</p>",2
1004564957.txt,"So I remember we were talking about something on Friday that (inaudible at 00:00:15). I don't remember what it was. So part of not remembering what it was is also that I want to talk about but not today if that makes sense.</p> Because I still don't remember.</p> Well I think...</p> I think I want to do the other first and then figure out next week. [00:01:03]</p> Yeah.</p> Oh I meant Friday.</p> Yes, as am I. So I kind of just like the whole weekend was kind of off. And that way I couldn't fall asleep. Friday I went to bed around 3:00 and woke up around 9:00 which I don't usually do. And a friend asked to come over and I had [inaudible] show which I had been joking that we should do. I was like yeah that sounds cool. And they (inaudible at 00:01:52) an hour and a half. And as I was getting ready to go he offered - he's like well I could just hang out here and then we could see the rest of the show when your pedicure is done. I'm like oh that sounds good. And he commented that he really wanted to do something repetitive and relaxing and asked if he could do the dishes. I was like yes I would let you do the dishes. That sounds amazing. [00:02:23]</p> She had come home. She was at the gym. She came home. First she got my text and she's like well I'm already on the way home. I'm like Ashby I'm going to be gone in five minutes, but I was trying to... And so she came home and told Colin that she completely didn't want him there, etcetera. [00:04:09]</p> Yes, pretty much. Fortunately I was with - her partner pulls a lot of the same thing so she's like do this, do this. I'm like okay. She suggested that I buy Ashby lunch and (inaudible at 00:05:04) because she also tends to exercise, and come home starving, and then not eat. (inaudible at 00:05:13). So it was just kind of a blah, yucky Saturday. And Sunday night I was just like I still feel kind of yucky like I was tired, and dehydrated, and vaguely cranky. [00:05:29]</p> It was sudden and unexpected. And the other thing that was really horrible about it is she refused to go to the hospital in an ambulance. She didn't want to go to the hospital because she's scared of hospitals and she would not get in the ambulance. So she was driven by one of my uncles and they got there and basically died. (inaudible at 00:08:54) what our family had thought at the time and the doctor kind of said the stress of getting into an ambulance probably would've killed her. Like she's probably having a heart attack. It was one of those things where it's like well the stress might have killed her but it also might have saved her life. There's no way to know. So that was really devastating to my cousin. [00:09:23]</p> So my whole dad's family has high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease, and a sweet tooth. Everyone does. And so he just wasn't dealing with it and he gave this really macho like I'm not going to go to the hospital or go see the doctor. And so his girlfriend they've been fighting. You've been sick for a while and finally she said either you go to the hospital or I'm breaking up with you. So they went to the hospital, the ER, on Sunday morning. And he has pneumonia, he has fluid in his lungs, his heart is enlarged - it's twice the size it should be - high blood pressure, high blood sugar, just basically everything, and kidney problems. [00:13:05]</p> Yeah. So my parents e-mailed me like these are all the things that are wrong with your cousin and he's really worried about his kidneys and the enlarged heart. Yes. That's true. So I called him and talked to his girlfriend a little bit. She was completely upset and freaked out and just exhausted because they'd been there since the early morning. I tried to talk to my cousin and he was like I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. I only talked to him for two minutes before I'm going to rest my eyes. Yeah. Rest your eyes. So I talked to her some more. And it's hard because I'm just like well she thinks that most of the heart problems are probably unmanaged diabetes plus having already beaten up your body. [00:14:08]</p> The doctors were like well a lot of this is treatable. You're not going to die right now but you need to do something. And they're doing tests today like stress tests and everything. But it was also one of things like when I was talking to here - I mean it wasn't this kind of thought occurred to me like he's obviously really ill, but it's like I don't know. I don't think anyone knows yet exactly how bad it is. And what he's done because he has such problems with anger, and these huge problems with authority, he has started his own business doing yard work things. And that was pretty good because no boss to argue with. [00:15:14]</p> Yeah. And my commented that my cousin Daniel has an old man's body basically like he's a young man with a beat up body. (Pause) So yeah we talked a little bit about it but mostly we were just both freaked out, and he was... My dad doesn't express a lot of worry. [00:18:32]</p> Yeah. And he hates talking on the phone or he hates calling people a lot for some reason. They hopefully understand. He's like well my kids should be calling me. I'm like I left a message. If he asks, just call me. So him after me calling him was really weird. [00:19:00]</p> Yes which...</p> Basically. And also there's not really comforting things to say like Daniel really is really sick. You know there's nothing really comforting to say like it oh it'll be fine. Like if it was just pneumonia I'd be like okay. Well pneumonia that's totally fixable. But everything and that he's been living with diabetes for five years and hasn't treated it. He's scared of insulin. He's one of those. So he's scared of taking insulin which is also insane. I'm like but then you'll die. [00:20:04]</p> Yeah. So his girlfriend was saying that he had actually (inaudible at 00:20:58) crappy for about a month.</p> Yeah, and so they had been arguing about it for a little bit but she wasn't sure. Sometimes he just acts sick when he wants attention. He wants her to make him dinner. And she had been away for work for the beginning of the week. And when she came back she was she was really tired. She wasn't quite sure if he was serious or not. And she was like I've been telling you to go to the doctors for weeks. How? And finally they had this huge blow out fight which was go to the doctor or I'm out. And she says she feels really guilty about having that fight.</p> I'm like yes but I support that fight because he went to the hospital.</p> Yeah, it's just so... I don't know. It's just so frustrating because it's all preventable. Like I feel like... I don't know. There's no reason for it to have gotten to this point. And I hope this wakes him up and makes him realize he needs to take care of himself, but I don't know. It took two felonies to get him to stop well sort of stop doing things that were illegal. I mean do we need two terrifying wake up calls? Can we just have one? And I almost thought with my Aunt and my Uncle dying that that would've given him hey go to the doctor. [00:23:05]</p> That's kind of what I've been doing. Yell about it, yell about it, instead of talking to them.</p> Yeah. I mean part of it is just like it's time for tests and waiting which sucks and (pause)... So Daniel's kind of melodramatic but one of things is he feels like people - I don't know. He worries that my family won't stick around, won't call him, won't look after him. And part of that is because he was horrible with his mom at the end of her life. And at one point - I don't remember what it was. So his mom did not leave him money directly. She left it to my Aunt to give to him because she knew if she gave it to Daniel he would just blow through it in drugs. [00:27:06]</p> (inaudible at 00:28:59). My dad felt the same way. He's like I understand that you're sorry but you also were really horrible to your mom. I don't know. Daniel feels like he's never gotten anything in life because no one's ever done anything for him. And he resents my brother and I because we got everything. We were given things he wasn't given. (Pause) And it's weird because I don't know what he expected. I'm like it's not like I was given admission to college. I had to work really hard for that and so did my brother and no one gave us our jobs. [00:30:17]</p> Yeah. Because Caleb will be like I'm better than you. I'm smarter than you. You're just... Caleb is smart and also an asshole. And he's had so many opportunities that he's completely trashed. He failed out of two or three colleges intentionally.</p> Because he was mad at his parents. And then he had two kids with someone to get back at his parents. And then got married also.</p> Yeah. Got married and had another parents to get back at your parents. He's done a lot of things to get back at his parents. He also was basically going to become a minister of a little store front church, but actually no one, I think, maybe including him knows why he didn't do that. He probably would've been good at it. He's very charismatic. But he's back in Cincinnati. He's on unemployment. He's, I think, living with a woman who's supporting him. I don't really know. But he's just needled Daniel all the time to make Daniel lose his temper which I really - I'm like why the fuck are you doing that? [00:34:22]</p> I think that Daniel believes that in some ways Caleb is better. Like Caleb actually went to college for a little bit and also did a trade school briefly. Like Caleb can sound more proper sounding than Daniel can. Caleb is kind of this smooth talking guy and Daniel is a blunt talking guy. [00:35:32]</p> Yeah. I mean part of it myself, my brother, Daniel and Caleb are all the same age. My brother and Caleb are the same age, and me and Daniel are the same age. So (pause) I don't know. So there's a (inaudible at 00:36:41) which I'm actually pretty sure that Caleb's parents and probably Daniel's parents to an extent would say things like why can't you be more like your cousin Seth and Karen which sucks. And I also just feel like as a family member I feel a certain level of (pause) responsibility for him. Like I really want to help him in any way I can. And I guess some of it is because he's caught up in things that happened a while ago. I find myself wanting to really say I think you've done a good job. Because to me one of the things that he probably really wants is I think he wants someone to say you have done good with your life. You are a fuck up that doesn't suck. And so... [00:37:59]</p> Yeah. And I don't know. Its seems like I don't call him that much because I hate being on the phone but also every time he gets on my ass about how I need a man, and I'm really not interested in that conversation. So I also talk about my life and what's going on and sometimes he sounds kind of - I think it's kind of - it sounds like it makes him feel kind of bad because I'm going to get a masters and he didn't really finish high school. We've had this sort of conversation about is he smart or we talk about regrets about the past. I guess in a way he feels, I think, kind of let down by our family. I think he does. [00:39:13]</p> Yeah. I don't know. Sometimes I wonder what if we had been closer to him in some magic way which [inaudible] was closer to Ohio. Like would he have had different role models that were close by. It's kind of what if...</p> Yeah. And there's also this other weird thing which my brother and I have talked about. My father has always said (inaudible at 00:43:23). They were, I think, raised like you've got to go to school, you've got to go to college, you've got to get ahead, you've got to do a lot better. And out of their kids most of them haven't it and it's really weird. Like Daniel is in the worse position than his parents were. Same with my cousin Chris. Caleb totally in a worse position than his parents are. And then Jim's daughter, Layla and Jeremy like Layla's doing pretty well for herself. She's working hard. Her brother we're a little unclear. Her brother it's a little unclear if he's into gay activity or not so it's kind of like everyone's like what the fuck happened. Like seriously, what the fuck? [00:44:37]</p> Yeah. You know it's just so... It's not survivor's guilt but it's like I feel bad for doing well. And the other thing I feel bad about is I think that in a way, yeah, I think his mom would be kind of disappointed. I know my grandmother would've been totally disappointed. [00:46:16]</p> Okay.</p> Thank you.</p>",0
1000133841.txt,"Hi, how you doing?</p> You had three courses - ?</p> Had to have all their grades turned in.</p> Oh. And they just came in to you today?</p> Oh, nice.</p> Oh, geez. That's a bummer for you, huh?</p> [When they throw that at you.] (ph)</p> Oh, really? Oh, gee. That's really rough. Wow. I uh, - there's really some things that happened. Well, just related to this thing with Don and - it's really strange. One thing I when we got to - well we had to go consult or council this family of [that girl that was around him] (ph) and then we got to staff meeting late. So after everyone left, Gary had made arrangements to stay an extra day at this cabin that we're going to this weekend and asked if would stay. And I felt like I really dealt with it very well and I said, ""I don't feel as though I can. Don isn't going to be taking off at all. He's going to be here and I feel a responsibility to him as well as wanting to [be with him there.] (ph) And I just don't think it will work out."" And he was really, really bummed out and I -</p> Yeah. Much more than I expected I guess.</p> Yeah, he really did. And I guess I didn't know whether we would have had a chance to talk about it or not. And anyway we went out to have a drink. We got done with the staff and all about 12:30 or something like that. It was closer to one because it was hard to find a place where we could have a drink because everything closes up [in Albany at one.] (ph) So we found a place to have a drink. And he was also bummed at himself. What was strange is I had accepted all of this as very close friends kind of thing and Gary came across with some things about very strong feelings for me. And I guess not just as friends or more than friends. And I'm really glad that beforehand I had decided what I was going to do because what I began to recognize is that I guess I felt like it would have been a really serious kind of thing in terms of Claire, Gary's wife, because he was talking - and I recognized this before - Gary leads like an almost entirely different life than his wife. His wife's perfectly satisfied being a wife and mother and revolving her world around that. [48:04]</p> Yeah, I guess it did. I guess part of it is I don't think I've taken it all quite as seriously as Gary. Maybe that's - out of his joking manner about a lot of things and I've taken it a lot lighter recognizing the way I feel and accepting it and feeling good about it. But also I feel as though the decision that I shouldn't spend an evening or a day or sleep with him whatever - the decision not to do that was a pretty adult one and one that I was dealing with my responsibilities and the priorities and stuff. Yeah, and my feelings. And I didn't know what to say. I really felt kind of bad that he felt so uncomfortable with that or so disappointed in it. And I guess I tried to explain it out of saying that I began to look at what was going on and - it wasn't helpful but it helped me - I just began to recognize that Don is really a priority for me. And it's not to say that I don't care about you at all -</p> Yeah. And I felt really good about that being honest. I often sort of twist things so that they're honest but not complete. So that worked through and Gary didn't feel real good about it. And I still left it sort of open. I said - He asked me again. He kind of pushed it. And I said, ""Well, let me think more about it."" I said, ""I don't think it's possible. I don't think it's maybe a good idea right now."" And I said, ""I'll think more about it but don't-"" and I was pretty straight about it. ""Don't count on it."" We were very tired. I did feel like thinking it over again. [51:07]</p> Yeah, and I did. I didn't get home till I guess it was about three o'clock. Don had gone out. He was going to go [uptown] (ph) and meet some friends. I came in and he'd left the keys in an envelope on the door. ""You lose."" We'd debated who was going to get home first should take the keys. And I went in and he was sound asleep and I was really quiet and I went to get into bed. And all of sudden he got really angry and got up, put his clothes and said, ""I'm sleeping on the couch."" And I said, ""Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What's going on?"" He didn't ask me why I was late or coming home late. I told him I'd be home somewhere around one o'clock. I figured I'd be done around one. And I was later than I thought. And all he could say was something about being worried or couldn't I call. And he didn't even allow me an opportunity to say anything to be defensive and explain or to say, ""Wait a minute. I don't have to be defensive about it,"" kind of thing. He just stormed out, found the couch uncomfortable and he came back. And I was really tired besides the fact that the whole evening carried a lot of heavy things. [52:30]</p> And I was so tired and I knew I had to get up the next - I just wanted to sleep. So we must have stayed up all night and said very little. And just wouldn't hear it. And I thought he'd been drinking. I mean he reacted in a really strange way. It just wasn't the way he'd react, I don't think. But he said he hadn't. He said he'd been home at eight. He just - I guess it was jealousy coming out. He couldn't understand why I didn't call him.</p> I think he wasn't just jealous of Gary. He was jealous of the whole thing in Albany. And I didn't feel guilty about that anything that had happened Wednesday evening. I felt pretty good about it all. And it was like coming home and having made a decision that meant something for the two of us and he was sort of there rejecting any attempt to listen. He's jealous about being excluded from what I'm doing at work. And like Thursday morning was a real bummer for a long time until we finally sat down. And he moped around. He wouldn't say anything. He feels excluded from what I'm doing; that I'm not sharing anything. In fact, he was ready to leave Thursday and take off to go back home, not come back for graduation. Even made a suggestion that he didn't want to get married to me anymore. And it was so irrational and -</p> Silly. Yeah.</p> Yeah. He was just like that. And I talked and I kept my cool for a long time. And I started at him that he was just being really foolish. That he wasn't listening. He was saying things like I don't share anything with him. I don't give anything of myself to him. That he wants to know what I'm doing in Albany - the kind of things I'm doing. And I never share it. I didn't call him and it was really, really inconsiderate and all. I'm leading this other life and excluding him completely from it. And what I said was, ""Well, I've been living alone. And we see each other - and there are lots of things I'd like to share but we're not together. And I'm used to being independent and having to work problems if they're at work or whatever all by myself. So why should I bug you with them. They're haven't been overpowering. If they're overpowering I certainly have shared."" And he just seemed to be turning everything I was doing into rejection of him, that I didn't think anything of him. I was being very, very selfish. [55:43]</p> Almost, Scott, except that I - because I felt -</p> Well in a way he did except that I really felt in control of myself. It was just though I was shouting because I was angry and I was letting the anger out and I was picking - the thing that makes me feel like I was in some control is that I think I was being very careful about what I said and how I said it. But I was angry and I was letting him know it. It was sort of I guess a build up of tension and all kinds of things. And he began to see that a lot of his ridiculous things that he was saying was just out of frustration of being bored sitting around here, my going off and fulfilling the responsibilities that I have to finish up and being excluded and getting all that out. And I don't know. He's kind of pouting around today because I'm leaving this afternoon. [57:35]</p> Yeah. It's the strangest kind of thing is that it's a really childish kind of thing. And I don't know if it's new for me to see this or what it is or if it's like he's trying to make me feel really guilty and really bad and not do things. I don't know.</p> Yeah. Well, for one thing I got my period this week and so he's been horny all week. So okay big deal. But he can't even deal with that and he's pouting around. Well, I'm sorry! That's the way it goes! And being kind of really silly about that, too. I don't know. Maybe it's just all these kinds of things and my leaving. Maybe it's a build up toward getting married and thoughts about that. And maybe they're getting to him more quickly than they're getting to me. Like I see Kevin becoming very, very nervous about the fact that he's getting married next weekend. Maybe kinds of things like that.</p> Yeah. I guess the question that arises for me is that I think that I'm being reasonable as I can given what I want to do and I'm going to do it. And I think I'm being as understanding and trying to be sensitive to him.</p> No, I mean reasonable in the sense that some of the kinds of things that are happening are kinds of things that I could easily blow up about and shout and scream and be irrational about.</p> Yeah. Like I think I'm keeping cool and not letting things blow my stack. I think I'm being patient.</p> Oh, yeah. It would be probably ridiculous. And I'm not - I guess that maybe I'm not dealing with it fully enough. Like one of the things he says, ""How many days have you spent with me?"" And I've spent considerable numbers of days with him since he's been here. I would probably be getting a lot more work done that I wanted to do. You know, kinds of things that aren't necessarily a requirement in terms of finishing up in school but things that I wanted to read, I wanted to get done before I left. Well, I'm not doing those things. And he said, ""This week, just this week, Wednesday and today are the only day,"" - well Friday, Saturday, I guess he didn't say Sunday - are the days when my time has been used elsewhere, that I haven't been able to be with him. And he said, ""Well what about next week?"" I said, ""I'll be back Monday. I have to go to Uptown Monday night. I have two appointments Tuesday in Albany, but we've got it set up so he's going to go and we're going to go visit some friends and Wednesday evening. That's it. That's all that I'm really committed - and I have a couple of things to write up. But I don't know. I guess just right now I'm beginning to think those kinds of demands - and as I was driving back from Uptown this morning I was thinking, ""I have a hell of a lot of adjustment to make around my independence."" And the kinds of demands Don is beginning - [62:02]</p> Yeah. My time is being demanded and I like to be alone sometimes. I like to read and I'm not being able to do any of those kinds of things. And just feel like - maybe much of it is because I'm leaving in two weeks and I'll be gone. And that may be a lot more of it than anything else. But that kind of demand on myself, like all of my time is kind of disturbing. I don't intend to and I don't want to have to give up all of my independence getting married. I mean my - I know I have a lot of dependencies too but the independent things I feel pretty strong about it. And I guess just this week they sort of really - it's being thrown out that -</p> Yeah. Like some of Sarge is setting himself up for being bored, you know?</p> By sleeping all day.</p> Yeah. And he wouldn't have to - at least not so completely.</p> [At least here.] (ph). Yeah, that's really strange. Yeah, I don't know how - last night he went out. They had stag party for Burt and he finally went later in the evening for a while. And that's fine. I didn't care when he came home. I was concerned that he came home. I'm concerned that he didn't get himself totally blitzed drunk because he wouldn't feel very good anyway. And we don't mix when either of us has been drinking a lot. You know, like really drunk-drunk. And he came home at one-thirty and I don't know how drunk he was. I don't think he was very drunk. And I didn't feel bad about not knowing when he was going to come home. And he just became - it was like being totally over concerned. And Daisy said something this morning too that she came in Wednesday night and said he was getting himself bombed. He was drinking rum and coke. So I don't know how much he had to drink but for me - it was a thought that went through my mind Wednesday or Thursday morning when I came home - it occurred to me that he was acting as though he had been drinking. And he said he hadn't. I don't know. I just left before I stopped at home before I came over here. And he came in and he said, ""When do we - what do you have to do after this class?"" I don't know. And I said, ""I have to leave right away because I have to pick this guy up downtown."" Just like that. And he started pouting around. I guess I feel a need to deal with that and I just - it's almost like that's intolerable to me. [65:42]</p> Well, yeah. I don't know if it's too much to take but it seems it's just really childish.</p> Yeah. Yeah. It really does. Well, it makes me uncomfortable when he won't talk to me. He sits around and ignores me. You know that's really stupid.</p> Huh?</p> Yeah. No (laughs) It isn't. I don't know if I do that if he does things to make me mad. I guess I'm wondering if I pout.</p> As that. Maybe I am. I guess I become quiet and don't say anything. And maybe I'm just getting some of my own medicine. But if that's the case then maybe this is all right to happen to recognize that. And then recognize that this just ain't the way we're going to have to deal with things. I just find it unacceptable.</p> Well, not yet because up until today I've tried with deal it by being sensitive -</p> Yeah. And being sensitive about what -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> Uh-hm. And the way he responds to those feelings. The way they come through. I guess that's sort of the way I began to feel this morning or this afternoon even. That it's the way he's dealing with the emotions and the things that are upsetting. And as I think about it right now, I think, is that the way I also deal with my emotions becoming quiet, pouty, and ignoring him? And if that's true and it may well be, at least somewhat true, that sort of to me suggests a game beginning to develop. And a really -</p> Yeah, a really stupid, childish kind of game. Or not that I'll out-pout you but - well yeah I guess it does boil down to that. But also that's going to be the response to being dissatisfied or uncomfortable. [69:19]</p> Yeah. Yeah. I know it's hard for me to talk like when things get me down or he makes me angry, it's hard to talk. Part of expressing why I'm angry or how it is to deal with the anger and sometimes it's out of trying to deal out whether it's really something I ought to be angry about, if I ought to - if it's something worth bringing up and creating anything out of. Maybe I do that more than I thought.</p> Yeah. And that just sort of comes to me as we talk here that that may be true. I do that too.</p> Yeah. Yeah. Right. I don't know if it's pouty but like I know certain ways that I can behave to get a response from Don. And 99 percent of the time I'll get the response I want. And I don't know how much of that is when I'm pouty. I've become anxious now thinking about just in terms of, ""Man, that's got to be dealt out really quickly."" Because I certainly don't want that to -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> Uh-hm. Right. That initiates responding in a much more -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I wish I could remember more of the stuff that we were saying yesterday morning. Like so many things were said that seemed to bear a lot of weight on the summer and next fall. Things happened really quickly and my memory is so poor like I block things. I don't know whether it's blocking or just I don't remember them all. I guess when - I don't know. I can't remember. I can't put things back together the way they happened. Maybe that was the beginning of really consciously seeing what happened just (inaudible@ 72:41) his ridiculous behavior, just really ridiculous. I don't know if I see more of myself in the kinds of ways he's reacting to things recently. And it may be okay if I recognize that and we can do something. Just recognizing it. You know what sort of bothers me about this is that thing we talked of once before about sometimes I accept the role or take it on of being kind of motherly. And this whole thing of being very childish reacting bothers me very much in the sense of it carrying over into a marriage, you know?</p> Well that and if it continues it's going to bug the hell out of me. Childish behavior from Don is very unacceptable to me.</p> Yeah. I don't know. And the thing I also - I don't feel as though I reacted in a mother kind of way. I don't feel like I took - I feel like I was acting as an adult. When he stormed out of the room Thursday morning - early Thursday morning; like three in the morning - I thought, ""This is really silly. This is just really silly."" And the thought, ""Well, I better go check this out and deal with it."" I'm not going to run after that. He has no reason - I mean, he has a reason. The only reason he had to be angry is that I didn't call and let him know I'd be late. Well, I didn't know for one thing how late everything was going to go. I didn't tell him that Gary and I alone went out and had a drink either because I don't want to add that to the fire.</p> Yeah, I don't really want to - and I feel as though like maybe in a couple of weeks I can share what happened and he'll be able to deal with it in an acceptable way. But I thought, I'm not going to respond that way because he hasn't - I don't understand exactly why he's so upset. I don't think it's totally justified in this kind of ridiculous behavior. And he's also extremely exhausted and decided I've got to - you know? If you came back all right, otherwise I'm going to sleep.] (ph) And off and on I don't think we slept at all. But off and on he would kind of take on a forgiving attitude and pull me close and put his arms around me and be okay. And then we'd talk for a while and I'd say something that - one thing was that he - the anger he verbalized was that I didn't call and let him know anything; that I didn't share anything that was happening. I should call and tell him what was going on. And I said, ""I'm sorry that I didn't call."" And I don't know how I said it. And I was sorry that I didn't call. On the other hand, I didn't feel it was that -</p> I mean it wasn't so crucial for the kind of anger that he expressed. So he said that of course he didn't believe me. That threw it off again and he got angry again. And again I just decided that it was really kind of silly. And maybe part of that was all that he had drank more than he thought too or maybe he was tired and it affected him more than he thought. [And some of the results came out of that] (ph) I've become very sensitive to - I guess more so he than I - which isn't necessarily going to reactions when we're drinking. And all reactions become more intensified. And we really try to be careful because all they do is they lead to arguments. I mean if we can decide we're going drinking or going to a party and get high and we decide that we're going to deal with each other and we're not going to get angry then it's alright.</p> Yeah. It was something that we don't do I don't think when we're sober and reasonable about things. It was so funny and it was so strange. It was a really disturbing kind of thing. And I guess it was more disturbing having some guilt feelings about Gary too for me. That Don really, really evoked guilt feelings for me where they weren't there a week ago or a week and a half ago. I didn't have any guilt feelings. I felt good and comfortable and I didn't feel like I had to be guilty. And he's really made me feel guilty about that. The thing about going camping, I feel like having gotten out some things yesterday like my having gotten out and saying, ""I'm going and I'm not feeling guilty because I've planned this. And it's going to create a whole lot more resentment if I don't go."" I think it's helped to alleviate the potential for building up guilt feelings for going. I don't feel bad about that either. We bought our tent yesterday.</p> Oh, wow! Yeah, I'm just getting really excited about it all. Don and I went and bought the tent. It's a really light-weight - it's for backpacking so it'll be really great. Don and I decided that we'll eventually work toward getting one of those real light-weight sleeping bags so we can do that. He was really good. Well, that was after everything got out and he felt much better. And he felt much better that I - he was really vehement about leaving and I think I made him see that that was really stupid. I mean that was - what I was throwing out to him was that's running away from dealing with things. And if I'm not sharing things with you that I ought to be, okay, that's something for us to work on. It's not something to run away from. I know that sometimes it's hard for me to share but - and he felt good about some of the things I'd said. So when we went shopping none of the resentment about going camping came up.</p> Yeah! Yeah. And we got it set up. We're going to pick up a cooler with S&H stamps. And I just can't wait to get out of that place.</p> Oh! Yeah. Just really love it. I've recognized that the camping I've done is relatively civilized. When I was very small camping with my parents was somewhat really camping. And then they got a trailer and it became more and more civilized.</p> So I've gone back to tent camping. And now I'm really kind of excited about trying to get into doing backpacking. Mostly because there's no place you can go to campgrounds anymore.</p> Yeah, you can't go in the car camping anymore.</p> Yeah. Yeah. That's it there. Betty and I'd kind of like to try it. I don't know if we'll get a chance to but I'm really anxious to do that. Some things that I buy now are aimed in that direction. And we figured we could go up to where Sarge lives in [Manomony] (ph) County, go for days and get lost. And he knows his way enough that we wouldn't be really lost and practice and do it. And I want to go back into the mountains and do that. I think that would be great. It really, really would. So that looks like it's all set up. Yesterday might have helped Sarge deal with the going too.</p> Yeah. I'm sure it's that. He recognized that it was a lot of things that were coming out. Like his blatant decision that he's leaving and he's not coming back was just needing to express some of that. I guess for a minute my response was to really blow up and, ""Go ahead!"" you know and respond in the same manner. And I caught myself. And I think if I didn't he may very well have let yesterday and started a whole -</p> Yeah. Yeah. A really, really foolish thing. I think I start to get feelings as plans are made for our wedding - I had been engaged to him a year ago and I'd broken that. And I didn't feel bad that I hadn't put an announcement or spread a word. And I wasn't very pleased about the whole thing. So that wasn't - and I thought, ""Jesus Christ, if I go along and have this wedding planned and that falls apart,"" you know it has a lot more ramifications than -</p> Yeah. Yeah. I said, ""I'm not letting that get away now.""</p> Yeah. (laughs) ""If I made this decision to put up with you for the rest of my life you're going to put up with me too!"" That kind of thing. Are things wrapping up fairly well for you?</p> No. Yeah. Well you'd said you're going to be - where...is it a?</p> Is it a cottage or a house?</p> Yeah. Last year I took an incomplete. I had a paper to do. And people kept warning me, ""You're not going to get it done."" And I said, ""I have all summer."" I never got it done in the summer at all. I didn't get it done until fall. And then you really got to get your mind focused on the intent to get it done. Well, it sounds like you're going to be in an awfully comfortable place.</p> I know! That's what I mean. Writing the dissertation becomes even harder as you get comfortable sometimes.</p> Yeah. I guess that's what I told myself too. That I'd never - although that this carries a hell of a lot more weight.</p> (laughs)I don't know. Every thought I had was of dissertation stuff. It's just too big a thing.</p> Yeah. That's true. Probably very true. I'm sure I would do that.</p> Well, that's a good attitude. (laughs)</p> (laughs) To keep yourself in that attitude is great. If it all piles up - are you going to be all-alone all summer?</p> Well that's good. She may not be helpful to getting your dissertation done though.</p> That's cool. That sounds like a really neat thing. Wow! We were talking about getting our farmhouse.</p> Oh, really?</p> Yes, it's not quite -</p> Yeah. It's not much rural area.</p> Yeah. They're not too difficult to get in Wisconsin. We decided that we should live alone for a little while just for ourselves. I have more and more people vowing to come up to spend time with us. We may not be alone as much as we want to. It may just become a big hotel for people. But I really think that would be great. I look forward to doing that. And just being in wider spaces than Chicago. And the last couple of days with the pollution and all, it's really getting to me.</p> Yeah. It's so - to be in a place where it's quiet.</p> That's such a different sound that it's really nice to hear. I-</p> Yeah. One thing I want to do this summer - I don't know if I'll be very successful - hopefully I will be stopping and camping at places for a week at a time. And I want to get myself adjusted to relaxing. I get going and I have to move all the time. I can't sit still. And I can't even deal with boredom. ]</p> Yeah. I want to just learn to sit and deal with being bored and enjoy it. And get myself to thinking again instead of always having things mapped out, ""This is what you're going to think about and this is the time slot for it."" And I figure there's going to be times when I'll be bored doing that. And I really want to work hard on it. Last summer when I took off for a couple of weeks and went out East, there was nothing to do. And I came back and I was relaxed. And it didn't take more than a couple of weeks before things were just going again. Part of it is the momentum of the whole city that does that. So I'm hoping Milwaukee if I can find a nice leisurely job - we may be living on public aid if I don't find a job. (laughs) Which wouldn't be bad. It'd be a new experience. I worked for the department of public aid last summer and it's a strange experience. I often thought what living on that kind of assistance would be like. Wow! ]</p> Huh?</p> Yeah. I hope everything goes good. I hope you get your dissertation written.</p> Yeah. I'm sure you will.</p> Yeah. I think I will.</p> I hope not either.</p> Well but that's okay.</p>",0
1000094426.txt,"And shorts and it's like really cold out. You guys are going to get sick. But I guess if you're from Michigan. </p> But you're from Michigan, right?</p> Oh, okay. You're from the Midwest. Okay. </p> So there were some words in my ... in that computer thing?</p> That I didn't understand. So I left them blank. If you explain to me what the word means, I can tell you.</p> Okay. I called one of my friends and asked her a couple of questions. And I was like, ""What is sloppy?"" And she's like, ""Messy. Disorganized."" It's like, ""Okay. Thank you."" (laughs) [0:01:11.2]</p> I had to call a friend. That's how it was. </p> Okay. </p> Well [why I don't tell you that] (ph)... I don't know. I'm glad I have health insurance. Living without health insurance here, it would be...</p> Yeah. I mean if you don't work, it's hard to.</p> Yeah. I'm-I feel happy to have it. And the university one is really good. </p> No. I'm just kidding. I was like, ""The flu! Oh my God. That's hard."" No, I'm just kidding. I was. I don't know, I was just kidding. Don't worry. I know you're not going to die because of the flu.</p> No, but yeah. I mean, yeah. I would be concerned if you were really sick.</p> (laughs) I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. </p> No, and I was thinking about what we talked last time. And I - and you were right. I never had the opportunity to... how do you say that. To gray... [0:03:17.7]</p> What?</p> Grieve. Exactly. Grieve that then. And then my mother had cancer. I had to be the strong one so I never had the opportunity to sit down and cry. When my mom had cancer a year before that, her - my mom's best friend died from cancer. Breast cancer, too. And two weeks after she dec-her name was Peta. After Peta died from cancer, my uncle died from cancer. And my uncle and my mom were really really close. </p> Everything.</p> Yeah, it's like-yeah. You give yourself all the reas-all the answers. </p> And yeah, it's like, I had the right to block my brain in those. I need to block my brain in those situations.</p> Then after five years, everything comes out like a boom. So yeah. So I understood what you were trying to-what you were asking me and trying to tell me.</p> Yeah but I-yeah. And it's all about understanding the stupid. You know the disease or understanding the person is old. Like my grandmother died? When did she die... I think it was in August-July August. She was really really sick and really really old. And so-and she was there in Portugal. And I'm here. And you kind of like-so she died. And the first thing I said was, ""Oh my God. That's so good. She was suffering so much. She had-because she had this cancer. You see I never... That's how I realize. </p> That I never told you that she-my grandmother died and she had cancer. Because I don't know. When they tell me. She was really sick and they didn't know why she was sick. She couldn't eat for I don't know how many months. And then-oh my God. I'm just shocked that I just realized that she died from cancer too.</p> When you asked me who died from cancer, I didn't have-I don't know. I never put her in the list. And I just realized that. So like they-</p> I don't know. Because-I don't know why I did it. Because she actually-she died from a respiratory. How do you say that, like-she stopped breathing. But she had cancer. The thing, okay, the thing is, she was really sick. Nobody knew what she had. They took her to the hospital. The doctors saw her and they couldn't find out. And after three days, they found out it was an amar (ph) or whatever. She a really really bad cancer. So they never treated her or anything. And she died four years after-four days or five days after the doctors realized that. </p> So that-that yeah. So yeah, perhaps that's why I never put her... </p> It was really hard. First, she was really sick for a lot of-long time. So you feel bad because she's suffering. Then I was not in Portugal and my mom was there by her-with my father. And my grandfather died in December so. So what? So, and I haven't seen my mom since that happened. I'm going back next month and... so yeah. Sometimes this something happens to me too. </p> That I'm here. I'm really happy to be here. I know this is what I want. But being away makes you feel like... how you say that in English. Guilty, because you're not there. And they understand that I'm here. My parents, they-what they tell me is like, ""Nothing can make us more happy that you're there."" But then you feel guilty that you cannot go back. And I would be-I would love to have the money. If something happens, you just fly there and be there. But I don't even have-I don't have the money. I don't have the time. I'm not going to ask my parents to give me money, several times a year to go there. So I feel guilty and I know I shouldn't feel guilty. That's the same thing my brain- [0:10:14.8]</p> You shouldn't feel guilty because this is what you want. And this is what is right. So, yeah. So that's that part. And it was the same when my grandfather died last year. It was the same thing. I was feeling like I should be there. I shouldn't be here. I should be there with my mom. Or whoever missed me. </p> Yeah. Because I don't know. And I don't think it's bad to feel that I should be there. But I realize that I cannot. It's so...</p> Yeah. So. But I still feel sad about not being able to be there. </p> Be there in that. During the hard times. I don't know. What, like-sit down and be next to the person. </p> Yeah, I think that.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I think it's that since we moved to the first city? All my family is in another city. So I didn't see my grandparents or I haven't seen my family in a long time. Four or five years. And I grew up like that. So I don't feel bad for not being able to say goodbye because they were never-for a long time, they were not in my same city. But yeah, of course you wish you had the opportunity to say goodbye. But yeah, so. But it's more like being close to the people that really needs it. My mom, she was really sad so it would be really good to be there. (cries) And being able to. </p> No, I mean no. Yeah, just to be next-I think in those situations, people... My best friend, her dad died from a stroke. Brain-yeah. And she always says how we, my other friend and I - we always were there sitting by-She didn't have to tell us what to do or like she needed anything. We just-we were just there. And that's how I feel. </p> My mom?</p> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I always tell-it's really funny. I always tell my parents everything. ""Oh I'm dating this guy"" or ""I'm going out with someone."" We always tell each other almost everything. And they're-my parents are always there. At the beginning when I got here. I had a lot of problems with my boss. He's quite crazy. But now I know how to handle him. and now we have a really good relationship. And he wants me to stay here. But at the beginning was really hard. It was the worst thing in the world. I don't know if I-I think I told you.</p> And I always-I always called my parents. I knew they were going to get a little worried about me. But it was the only people I could just call and tell them. Because sometimes friends-if you talk a lot about work, they'll get... (laughs) My parents are always there. I call them and it's like, ""I have this problem"" or ""I'm feeling like this."" I don't know. They understand me a lot. We have a good relationship. </p> Yeah, so I think I feel bad and not being able. Not only to be there, but also you want to support them, too? And you cannot.</p> Yeah, and I know that they are happier now, that I'm here and that I'm following my dream. I'm studying and I'm - that if I were there, sitting right next to them without doing anything. I would rather have my kids away and learning and growing up. That, and doing anything in the house. So that's what - that's what's it. My brain says something and my emotions say another thing.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, that's good.</p> Yeah but that - </p> Yeah. I think since Portugal is such-we're-it's a poor country. We also have violence. We also have a lot of things going on. So I think we're faced with death and with really bad things, more often that what a person from Whitehall or a small town would. Yeah, so. Yeah and life expectancy in Portugal is way-I mean, way shorter than here. [0:19:28.7]</p> Yeah, and when the people like my grandparents, when they're old, always says, ""Well they were suffering a lot. For a long time. They rest."" But you still fee-you still feel the loss. </p> And it's like an irra-an irrational feeling. No, how do you s-yeah it's like very... I don't know. Cavemen feeling. Nothing has-it has nothing to do with your brain. It's just that you feel it. You believe you know they rested and they're not suffering anymore. [0:20:39.6]</p> And I was in the middle of finals at the university. So she never told me. She told me. Yeah. I was in finals and work and had due dates and things like that. And she never told me. So she found out on her birthday, which was May 23rd. And then, I was in finals. They scheduled the surgery and everything. And two days before the surgery, she tells me. ""I have cancer. They're going to-there's going to be a surgery in two days."" And I'm like, ""what? How didn't you tell me?"" It's like, ""You were in exams. I didn't want to-you work really hard during the whole semester. I didn't want to screw your grades."" </p> I think I -  at the beginning I was so mad at her. But - but yeah, so I told her, ""What is wrong with you?"" How do you say that in English. I faced her. ""How didn't you tell me this? Why do you have to get this for yourself?"" And she's like, ""Well you were in your exams. I didn't want to get in your school."" And then... but then, the surgery came. So I felt mad at her for a couple of-what, a day or something. And then I was really sad. </p> Oh! I mean, really good. But-yeah. Really, really good. But I still feel-it's-I mean-I know a lot of people. That, her friends for example. A lot of people develop the cancer ten years after or, you know, like. So I cannot close my eyes and say, ""She's completely..."" </p> And then also, I don't know. I'm one of the people that think that -  a lot of stress, a lot of depression, things like that, can make things easier so you can get cancer again? And she always stressed. You know, like, well-she has -  my brother, drives her crazy. And then she... I don't know. She was really depressed. Now she's going-I told you she's going to this psychiatrist. I don't know. She's been through a lot of stress in the last three or four years. </p> No. It's just that... </p> No, like I'm - I'm afraid that it can happen. And sometimes she needs someone that tells her that she can - that she needs to calm down. So I get really serious and I'm like, ""You have to-you have to."" For example, I tell her, ""You have to exercise more often. You need to this..."" </p> Well I-it's hard. I think it's really hard to see. But -  but I also see that we're humans and all the moms are like that. All my friends.</p> No no no no no. It's my emotions. I always get-it's hard, it's hard. But I'm happy that-for example, I tell her, ""You have to exercise more."" And she listens to me. And she tells me or says something and like ""Well I'll try it."" And then she does it. And that's good. I can tell her something and she always takes my advice in a good way.</p> Yeah. And - </p> Yeah, and more like helpful. </p> And you know, like sometimes I try to - I feel helpful and feel like I'm doing something good for her to-that it's not... Sometimes it's hard, like to make -  like your parents are always helping and helping you. And if you can help them, and I think that's nice. </p> That I'm applying to schools and so I - (laughs)-my poor mom. I asked her - - I asked her to do all these, asked for transcripts, for recommendation letters. Go here, go there. Get financial certificates. Ask for my professional registra-I graduated and I started doing research. So I never cared about the professional. In Portugal we use a professional card that says you're a pharmacist, or whatever you are. And I never did that. So she's right now, running around doing about everything for me. That's why.</p> No, I tell her all the time. I'm - I mean it. I'm thankful. </p> Yeah, it's -  yeah, it's... yeah.</p> It has really helped me a lot during-like, I don't know. I called her every day. It's like, ""Shoot, I forgot to send you this."" And then it's like, ""I'm running out of money."" And she's like, ""Don't worry, don't worry. If you are going to get into school, I'll..."" </p> And my dad is the same thing. They e-mail me twice a day. ""Do you think we should do this or we should do that?"" You know, like with all the paperwork they're doing there. I'm grateful. That's why I'm - my tears come.</p> Yeah, but. But I tell them, too. </p> Yeah. And I think I'm - I'm the same thing. </p> And we talk and she tells me this and that. And so. So I think both of us are being supp - - and like my dad, too. He's more reserved. He doesn't tell me everything. She even tells me that she fights with him. And I'm like, ""Mom! Come on."" </p> But oh well. I'm glad because I can tell her ""Don't tell me that."" And... but yeah. I think they're really supportive. And I try to do the same thing, with them. But it's hard. [0:31:37.4]</p> To be far away. </p> Far. I don't know how far it is. I think that a direct flight would take you, what? Six hours to get there. </p> Yeah, it's hard. </p> Yeah, and then, then again, it's like you're brain is fighting with your emotions because it's like-at the beginning, happened - - I got here, and I met a lot of people. The first three weeks, I kind of didn't realize I was here. Or like-or like I was going out and there was meeting people. Going out in Whitehall. Having my own apartment, which it's something-everything is cool. When you get here, things are so cool. </p> Didn't I tell you? No, yeah, that I-there was a semester in school, a fourth semester or something like that. I was working really hard, and I broke up with my boyfriend. </p> Yeah, I think I told you. And I never cried. And after all the due-all the deadlines were - like I gave all my work-I started crying. The doctor said, ""You cannot think about anything during the whole week."" And I'm like ""Uh!""</p> Yeah. </p> That's when I was in college, yeah. So it always happens to me. So, that's why I like to come to therapy because it's a place where I can say whatever I feel and without being indent-you know, like with-so those things don't happen. </p> Hm?</p> Yeah. So.</p> Then I think it was happen-I got here, one and a half year, feeling lonely, being away. All the pressure of the work. At the beginning, I should have come a year ago. The beginning didn't work. So everything starts to build up. Then the GRE and applying to schools. And I'm like, ""I need to go therapy. I'm going to get crazy if I don't."" Yeah. That. It's good to ... to say things. [0:35:28.3]</p> Really good. Really good.</p> Or cry. (laughs)</p> You're going to think the person who cries-I'm the person who-I think if there were a psycho-like-com-how do you say that? A competition of who cries the most in this world, I think I would be one of the... </p> I've been always like this. All my time. </p> Oh my God. I used to cry so much. In school, they used to make fun of me. And then they realized, she's sensitive. And they like me. But yeah, I've been so so so... and my mom's the same thing. </p> Oh, she cries all the time. You tell her something and she starts crying. And you're like, ""Mom! Don't cry!""</p> I don't-yeah. That's that, like... I don't know. I'm always trying to e the strong person and I'm really sensitive. But I think I can deal with being strong for short periods of time. And then I just start crying and crying. I think I'm all-I've been always like that. I can play the strong role, being a strong person. But for a short period of time. I cannot be-because yeah, I'm very sensitive.</p> How does it look when I'm the strong person?</p> How do I act or?</p> I don't know. I'm not very nice, I think. Just kidding. I don't think-I can be really strong. I can be... I don't know.</p> Of what?</p> I don't know. For example with all my brother's stuff? I have to tell my parents I'm leaving the house. And I left my house. So they would just call me on the phone and... I tried to be as strong as possible so they understand how the bad the situation was. I would never cry. I cry a lot. But I never cry. Or like I would... I don't know. Yeah, I can - I told them you have to go to therapy. I can... I don't know. How can I describe how strong. I don't know how to describe that. [0:39:46.3]</p> Or handle really strong situations. With my thesis in college, it was not working. So I had to go and I started doing it with volunteers. People who were giving me the samples. I-it was not working. So I had to get bigger samples. I was trying to make a graph for mouth-health. Like mucosa. Palaton (ph) mucosa. And so it was not working because the samples were really small from the gum in the back. So it was not working. So I had to - I had to get big samples. So I had to go and work with dead people.</p> For six months. And I've never seen anyone dead-I used to get really shocked with dead animals. I would see a dead mouse and I was just like - - before that-I would cry and get  - - but then I had to do my thesis. And I had to do my research. So I was like, ""Okay. Suck it up. You have to do this. "" Because I talked with my advisor and basically I'm like, ""Are you sure you want me to do this?"" and she's like, ""You need to graduate."" So I had to start working with dead people. And this was like-</p> So it was, uh. That was wrong. (ph)</p> It was my last year in college. We have to do thesis in undergrad. Like an undergraduate thesis. So it was, it was hard. It was really bad. But it was. Then I was stronger. I was like-if I-and then, it was always 3 am on a Thursday night or a Friday night. They would just call, ""We have a patient, somewhere in the city. You have - if you want your samples, you have to come and grab it. And wait for the whole surgery."" </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I always-I've always believed in donating organs. So I'm - I have in my license 'Donate your organs and tissues.' I don't think you will-I don't know. I think in some cultures. I was talking to a Chinese friend. And they don't-they think that you need all your organs and everything for after you die. I always-I've always said, even before the work. I always said in my-if something can happen -  anyone else. Like a kid, heart. Well, what - Kidneys, heart. You know just-I'm not going to take these anywhere. I'm not bringing. Well, to the worms in the ground. [0:44:29.5]</p> Like that. So. </p> Yes. I think it's-you really appreciate life. And you start looking at life like I'm here to enjoy this. To do whatever I want. There's... yeah. </p> I think it was like-the first time I went there, so I've never seen anyone dead. Not even in my family. We don't do the open-</p> Caskets in the funerals. I'd never seen anyone dead. So I had to go there by myself. Which is in the downtown-right downtown, right next to the worst places. Where-there's a street  - there was, because they're trying to eradicate it. A street in Lisbon which is full of - but full, where all the drugs are, and all the homeless people go. Drug addicts. People say if you walk down the street, you'll never make it to the other end. I don't think anyone here in the United States can imagine how bad it is. You don't want to. You don't-it's like-let's say two blocks of hundreds and hundreds of homeless drug addicts. </p> For eight autopsies at the same time. And it's like-and it smells awful. And then all types of people were dead on those tables. And I was the only helper. I was by myself. No one was there. So the technicians that helped doing all the autopsies. Because there are so many-you cannot have a doctor doing-all the doctors. Because there are so many dead in this place. </p> So it's like, ""Look at - ."" So you appreciate that they treat you so well because they're going to have to do it this for me. You know, like I asked them favor. And they're like, ""Oh, you should see this! Look at the size of this liver."" Or ""Look the bullet in the brain."" And you're like ""What?"" So after that I was like-I couldn't eat for meals.</p> And then they do-when they open the cape-the rib cage, I don't know how to-yeah. So it looks like the ribs you eat in a restaurant. And I was like, ""I will never eat ribs again."" So it's like-""Oh my God."" Yeah. But it's good because you realize-doesn't matter who you are or who you think you are. It's like-life is just one. You have to enjoy it. Do whatever you want. Because you can die tomorrow.</p> Yeah, I think I did. Yeah, I think I did. I really started focusing on what I wanted to do. Stop trying-I don't know. Sometimes you always compare yourself with other people-""Oh well, this person got this."" ""He or she had this."" I think after that, I was-I'm so lucky that I have this life. A home and food. I don't-I'm not on the table today. Or I'm not the family. So this is the place where everyone goes-how do you say that, John Doe? Is that how you guys - </p> How you guys call it here? In Col-so all the people, all the families go there and ask for the missing. And then suddenly realize your-whatever -  person can be there. So one day I woke up. I had to go there 6 am and my brother didn't show up for the whole day. So my mom was crying. And then she tells me, ""See if your brother is there."" And I'm like, ""What?"" I'm not going to. So I was like, I'm not going to get into that room without asking before. So I went to the lady who -  where the people go and ask. So it's like, ""Don't tell me you have someone this description, this age."" And she's like, ""No, we don't."" It's like, okay, so I can get in. </p> And my brother showed up in the afternoon that day. </p> That was bad. I-no-I mean, I was concerned. But I knew that I had to ask first. And that I couldn't put a lot of crap in my head before the actual thing. But that was hard. My mom was like, ""now that you're going there. You should ask if your brother is there. If he's-I don't know where he is for like..."" He was partying for two days. But yeah. That was hard. That was. And also I learned not to drink and drive. </p> It's like, yeah. </p> Yeah, I have to go. Yeah. </p> Yeah. Tuesday? </p> Or Monday after - I have a lunch with a speaker in the college pharmacy until one. </p> Yeah. If for any reason my boss tries to schedule any meeting with the speaker, can I call you so we can see if like...?</p> Have the meeting later that day, or something like that?</p> Because sometimes my boss is like that. He's very Portuguese in that sense. </p> Oh that's something we have to talk about (ph) - my boss.</p> Yeah, he's just too many lately. </p> So on Monday afternoon, I'll tell you about something. Bye.</p>",2
1004538594.txt,"It's okay.</p> Hi.</p> I'm sorry about yesterday. I don't know what happened. I just completely totally flipped my mind.</p> Like it wasn't even a case of I know I should go, but I'm feeling miserable, and I don't want to get out of bed.</p> It was just like it wasn't even ...</p> Neither do I.</p> And I mean I had a lot going on this week.</p> I've been feeling pretty miserable, but (sigh) ...</p> So three weeks ago, I picked up a writing assignment from the website I occasionally write for, and they wanted ...</p> Yeah.</p> Well, there's this game that was quite fun, and they needed a walk-thru for it, so I said, ""Sure,"" and then, you know, as I progressed through the game, and it got increasingly more difficult. It got more difficult to get the walk-thru done. And it just was stalling out and getting frustrating, and I also had these wedding invitations I needed to make, and those were two pretty big projects.</p> Yeah, well - and at the print shop at least, like there's no point in going unless you have like a four- to eight-hour block of time because stopping points aren't that frequent, and clearing off and making the shop usable for the next person to come in. [00:02:03]</p> Like it's a half hour at minimum to set up and get going, and then, an hour of clean up and tear down -</p> - so, like ...</p> Right. So, you know, I would come home and be really tired and be like I have this assignment to do that I need to work on, and it got increasingly tedious. What was fun and entertaining for the first 30 levels by the time I was on level 70, which was like -</p> - oh, my God. Get me out of here.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. So, I was feeling increasingly upset with myself for not getting that done by deadline, and, you know, reverted to a bunch of patterns of, you know, avoidance and fuck it, I've been miserable all day, I deserve to like kick back and have a glass of wine and watch a TV show with my husband, but I deal with school. And his brother has been visiting us since he went down to Philly Friday night, came back with his brother Sunday, and his brother is staying with us. And his brother is very high needs. He's very low functioning down syndrome. [00:03:19]</p> And that's just like hugely stressful, -</p> - even though Dave is doing most of the work of taking care of Brandon, you know, like goes to work during the day, and -</p> - since I'm not taking classes and my job hasn't started yet, I've got Brandon during the day.</p> Yeah.</p> Not on my own. No.</p> So I had him Monday and Tuesday. And yesterday and today, Dave took him to work with him. Dave booked a conference room at his work, and he and Brandon have been - he's been working in the conference room and then setting Brandon up with a spare laptop and some TV shows to watch, and some Kindle games, and etcetera, etcetera, but - so I don't know. Yesterday, I got up, and Dave and Brandon had already left the house, and it was like, ""Ah. This is really nice. Dave took Brandon to work. I can like stay in bed, relax, read a book. I got up and made, you know, some pancakes for breakfast and enjoyed my day - [00:04:30]</p> - and then got your text message and it was like, ""Oh, shit."" Oops.</p> And I also spent a good bit of yesterday trying to force myself to go in to the print shop and get some work done on that, but ... I felt guilty because the - the walk-thru that had an earlier deadline still wasn't done, so I stayed home and tried to work on that and got distracted by other things, and ... yeah.</p> Thirty. [00:05:14]</p> Yeah.</p> It's not the writing so much as the taking screenshots, which is a pain in the neck because the Kindle and the Nook don't have native support for screenshots. You have to connect them to your computer and then install -</p> - programs from the computer for your computer to grab the screenshot off the USB. And then marking up the screenshots with directional arrows - [00:05:46]</p> - and very specific directions. It's - it's a puzzle game, and part of the challenge is to complete the level in as few steps as possible, so, you know, in - in a field that might be, you know, 15 squares by 15 squares, there's no way you can describe that in words and be concise and legible. You have to do it visually ... which, yeah. It's a lot of editing and Photoshop and that gets - you know, the first 30, 40 levels or so were fairly straightforward. One screen shot, a couple of lines, and Photoshop, done. But as the levels get increasingly more complex, it was like okay, this image is getting too cluttered. I have to break it up into two images. Now I need four images. You know? It got to the point where I was needing to edit, you know, eight or nine images per level, and I was just - [00:06:43]</p> - like I eventually e-mailed my editor late last night and was like, ""Here is what I have. I can't finish this. I'm sorry."" And he was kind of annoyed, but ...</p> That's a lot, even though I had two weeks to work on it. It's still a lot.</p> Sure. Sure. I mean ... the payment for anything I do for this site, if you think of it in hourly wage basis is absurdly ridiculous, but the payment is on a sliding scale depending on how complicated the game is. And there certainly is recognition that this is a lot of work, and - you know, if I had gotten it completely finished and submitted on time, it would've been like eighty-five, ninety dollars. Which again, given the amount of time spent on it is like a crap hourly rate. But, you know, for writing gigs, writing gigs don't pay that well, and this site pays better than most, so ... like for a simpler game, you know, like there have been some walk-thrus I've done where the games were simple enough that they were like eight dollars, ten dollars, whatever, so at least there's a recognition that this is a harder than average ... [00:08:29]</p> Right.</p> But like I don't do it for the money because like ...</p> I have a Master's degree. I can earn far more in my day job. This is not - like I do it mostly for the entertainment and -</p> - the challenge.</p> Yeah. So ...</p> Yeah.</p> Right.</p> Right.</p> Yeah. And also, I had a terrible time Friday evening.</p> Yeah. I went to this event with some friends, and I went with my friend, Brenda, and her roommate, Ann. And I was running late from the start, which, you know, my bad, and Ann was annoyed with me at the start for running late, which you know, fair enough. Well, then there was the event itself, which was a book reading by a woman who is part of the, you know, Emphatic Substance Movement. And, you know, I asked what I thought was a fairly reasonable question, which is, you know, you look at these fashion blogs written by and for fat people, and they're all very feminine, very girly, and where - like where's the aspirational fat - fashion images for people who aren't skinny enough to read Mainstream fashion blogs and aren't fem identified like?</p> And Brenda's roommate, Ann, just jumped all over me for that. Another friend of Brenda's talked down to me like I was a 12-year-old, like explaining that, you know, not every blogger's fashion suits every reader. I mean there are like 400 people who post outfit photos to the Fashion Community, and of those, I may - maybe five are my personal style or maybe you just need to look a little harder, and, you know. Like seriously, come on. Really? Like I - I understand that not everyone's style is for everyone, but looking at general trends, and - like if I was just terrible, and she was just really condescending and snide, and then she was like, ""And I've been trying really hard to be tactful, but it's hard, you know."" I was like that's just so like - I want to say bitchy, but I try to avoid gender insults when I can, but really, like let's just... (Sigh) I'm trying to be tactful. It's just ... [00:11:59]</p> Yeah. And so, you know, we're standing in line to get books signed. I made a comment to Brenda, who is the friend who invited me, but, you know, well, you know, your friend was really insulting to me. I don't appreciate being talked down to. Like I don't know what was going on. I'm like these are sorts of things friends say to each other like when you're frustrated and so, -</p> - like if you're hanging out with a friend and something someone says frustrates you, you might comment about it, and Brenda's roommate just jumped all over me. She was like, ""Well, you were being really reductionist and rude. And I don't think you understand what it's like to be a fat woman."" I'm like, ""Excuse me? You don't think I understand?"" I mean I was probably the skinniest person there, but I can't buy clothes in a regular department store because the sizes aren't big enough for me to wear, so, you know.</p> Yeah. Pretty much. I just completely lost it and like started crying right there in the middle of the store, which was super humiliating for me, and so Brenda pulled me aside, and we were talking, and like ... [00:13:07]</p> No.</p> Yeah. And - like I think Brenda was just completely misunderstanding what I was trying to say 'cause she was like, ""You know, it looks like you're having a meltdown, and, you know, I'm sure they didn't mean to be mean to you, and they didn't mean anything personally, and, you know, let me give you some resources for finding fat fashion."" I was like, ""That's not the point."" Like I - I can totally understand if the answer to my original question was, ""There's just no website serving that demographic. Sorry, you lose."" Like the point - and like ...</p> Yeah. And I don't think I was being very clear about that. And, yeah, I was getting increasingly more upset. And at several points in the conversation, I completed Brenda personally with the movement in general and how it's so very extraordinarily straight, feminine centric, and Jesus Christ, it's so irritating. And (laughter) since Brenda is in fact a queer woman, that was really insulting, and I wasn't with it enough to realize how insulting I was being at the time. But once I got home, I realized, ""Wow, I was being a real dick to Brenda, who is my friend and who was trying to be supportive,"" and ... so, yeah, just completely miserable about an hour after I got home. And Dave was out of town. So yeah, I called my friend, Tom, and he came over and spent the night and failed to get out of bed until like 4:00 the next afternoon, but these things happen, so ... [00:14:57]</p> Well, it got better once I contacted this guy, Jesse.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Then I felt guilty all day Sunday because Saturday I spent the day with Tom instead of getting work done on either the wedding invitations or the walk-thru. And yeah, it's just been at this point a whole week of browbeating myself for the things I should've done already but haven't gotten done yet.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Right.</p> Right. I don't know. That hadn't even occurred to me. No, it's been more of ""Why haven't I got these done already? Why didn't I go to the print shop yesterday? Why are they not coming out as nice as I want them to come out - come out? God, I suck,"" and ... [00:19:03]</p> Yeah.</p> You're right. It is nice to have the time to work on it. If I were still working on the thesis or if I were still taking the classes this semester, there's no way I'd have the time to even consider it like.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Right.</p> I mean and I picked this up because - so, there's a mailing list for everyone who's qualified and trained to know the press. And she had e-mailed back in November asking for this job to get done, and the current print shop manager said, ""Yes, we can do that. No problem."" And they went back and forth throughout the month of January finalizing the design, and the manager was like, ""Sure. We have undergrads who would be totally happy to get this done for you over spring break."" And spring break came and went, and all of the undergrads who are active members of the chapter of our fraternity just completely flaked out because, you know, they're undergrads and that's what happens. And Vivienne was saying in a chat room that a number of us frequent semi-regularly that she was really frustrated that, you know, those undergrads said they could do it and they couldn't, and she really wanted hand printed invitations, but they were going to have to find a professional printer. And I was like - actually, just yesterday in fact, my advisor said that she was done with me, so - [00:20:43]</p> - so I can take this on. No worries. And yeah.</p> So that was - that was the 6th. I know because our paper was due on April 5th. And today's what, the 24th?</p> The 26<sup>th</sup>. Yeah, that was three weeks ago. That's not that long ago.</p> Yep. And they're still not done. I need to go in after I'm done here. I'm actually gonna grab a late lunch and then go in and do some work.</p> Yep. It's true.</p> Like I feel if I had gone in at 9:00 AM every day, I could've taken it. I could've done it in a week, but I didn't, in part because I can't get out that door that early. And in part because after three days in a row of working the press, I was physically exhausted and too sore to put in another day. [00:21:55]</p> And then I lost momentum and I had this other project that was taking -</p> - my attention and ...</p> Yeah. It's also possible that I should've recognized my limits and not taken on the walk-thru project and just told them, ""Sorry. I can't do this."" Or, you know, cut my losses earlier or ...</p> Thanks.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. They had a (inaudible at 00:23:34) says that, you know, the walk-thrus are pretty much no financial value to the site unless they go up the same day that the game review goes up and unless they're complete when they go up, so, I don't know. Something's better than nothing I guess that ...</p> Like really, I should just tell them that I don't want to write for them anymore and get off all the mailing lists. This is not the first time this has happened, and ... [00:24:03]</p> Yeah.</p> Well, see what happened was there was a Q and A session after the talk, and my question was one of many. And when I asked it, like there were cheers from several people in the audience, and the speaker was like that's a problem and I know it's a problem, and I don't know where to find those images.</p> Like I think the speaker actually understood my question.</p> And she was like, ""I don't know and that's a problem."" And I tried to recruit people to do that kind of blogging, but like it's really hard to find.</p> And, you know, that was fine. It was after the fact when -</p> - you know, this woman came up to me and she was just all patronizing, and I was like seriously. I tried to explain that no, actually I have looked and you might think you don't have a lot of role models because you found 5 out of 400, but I found zero out of thousands. And she continued to be patronizing and ridiculous to me, and that's the point where I cut that conversation short -</p> - and went to go talk to the friend who invited me.</p> Like Br - yeah. Like trying to seek support from her. And then her roommate just dropped this, ""Well, you were being reductionist and rude, and I don't think you understand, and like ...</p> And then she just turned around and walked out of the bookshop. It's like seriously, you're going to say something rude and dickish to me, not even wait for me to respond, whether - like I was still trying to decide if I wanted to challenge the content of what she said or just say something snide about her attitude. But like, she didn't give me a chance to do either.</p> Like seriously?</p> Yeah.</p> And maybe it is a tiny bit reductionist to say, you know, well, there's either fem fashion or butch fashion, and never between shall meet. But like ... I feel like A, I would expect Ann at least who has met me several times and knows me like I'd expect her to know that I know there's more than just like the simple binary between fem and butch. And also, like I was trying to ask a question quickly in a Q and A session where, you know, each question was given 20 seconds -</p> - and it's like you don't have time to go into a long discourse about, you know, all of the different variations and interplaying, you know.</p> Right.</p> Right. And I mean you could get into a whole discussion about, you know, lesbian culture, and how there's this assumption that butches are butch because they don't care about fashion, and fashion is a fem thing, and then you're into scapegoating in front of an Indian, you know, going all the way back to the Victorians and how men lost the ability to be fashionable because the Victorians decided that fashion wasn't for men. There's a whole like, you know, replicating heteronirmative gender stereotypes within the queer female community, where you have the early fems and the manly butches. Like there's this - [00:29:52]</p> - you could have hours and hours and hours of discourse about that, but not (laughing) said at a Q and A session.</p> I mean really.</p> Right. And like, I guess part of what I was asking when I was asking the question was I was hoping like there is some fabulous website that just like, I was using the wrong Google search terms or whatever, -</p> - but it turns out no, no one can find. And then, a lot of people spoke to me after the fact and said, ""Well, you know, I don't know of any queer fashion websites for fat women, but you could look at like all of these awesome websites for fat dudes."" There's like, I get that you're trying to be helpful and supportive, but, you know, this idea that if you don't identify as feminine and don't want to dress in like mainstream feminine styles, that your only option is the eight various male subcultures like - [00:30:53]</p> - but that's another false dichotomy that you can either dress like a woman or like a man. Like there's - like I feel like the - for both male identified and female identified people, there's a whole range of -</p> - how you can present yourself that...</p> It's so frustrating.</p> Right.</p> Right. I mean - I don't know. I'm very lucky in the regard that my high school was very - it's not actually queer friendly, at least accepting, and not hostile to LGBT kids. And then, in college, the - the co-op house that I lived in had a number of gender queer people. Like half the house was somewhere in the LGBT Umbrella. And all of my friends were queer or, you know, at least active allies. And so, it was just (clears throat) - I sort of - I've never had the - the need to see queer role models and media because I didn't have that in my life 'cause I always - I always kind of had that, - [00:32:37]</p> - like the entire time I've been aware of my sexuality. So in that regard, I'm very lucky, but, you know, there's also the fact that I went to an engineering school that even though, you know, we had parity in terms of male and female admissions, there was still this whole male culture, and a lot of the women I knew were very much about fitting in with the guys. And there's also this aspect of geek culture that, you know, fashion is for people who are too stupid to do real things with their lives. So there's the whole, you know, block of development for my life where I really believed and internalized this message that, you know, there's something wrong with you if you care about fashion or if you care about how you look. And it's only been like in the last two or three years that I've started to realize that - no, actually I do care about how I look, and I care about my clothes, and I want - like there's an image of myself that I want to present to other people, and I don't want that image to be, you know, a person who thinks she's above caring about this shit. [00:33:39]</p> Yeah, there's - and again, we could have a whole conversation about fashion and the distraction for women and a way of keeping women in their place, but (sigh) I don't know. It's complicated. And I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it, but I do want to take more care in how I dress and how I present myself, and that's - I don't know. I was always teased for my clothing when I was a child because, you know, my parents bought me cheap clothes that they thought looked good, but... You know, my parents would send me to school in like discount dress pants from Wal-Mart, which is just a horrible combination for so many reasons. It's like you're wearing dress pants, but they're not even quality dress pants. They're like cheap, crappy polyester, and like instead of like wearing what all the other geeks are wearing. [00:34:28]</p> And so, like I have a great deal of fear of committing a fashion faux pas, which is why most of my clothes are fairly plain like -</p> - like solid color turtlenecks, solid color button-up shirts, plain jeans. And that - that's boring. That's really boring, and I - but I don't feel comfortable picking my own exciting clothes, so that's why I really want to find fashion magazines or blogs or whatever where I can say okay, this is what people who I think look cool are wearing. [00:34:59]</p> I mean maybe I should just like get over my fear of negative evaluation from other people and say, you know, who cares, but ...</p> Yeah.</p> And I'm trying really hard not to be upset at my size because well, that way of life's made ys, but it's also not very healthy, but I don't know. There's a big part of me that wishes I could just be skinny because then there - all of these styles that look like crap on me because I'm big, and if I was skinny and had smaller boobs, that would just be fine and ... [00:36:11]</p> Yeah.</p> Hmmm?</p> Oh, yeah. Like, my parents started telling me that I needed to diet and make sure I didn't put on weight 'cause, you know, when you grow up, it's much harder to take off weight than when you're young, starting when I was 10. Like ...</p> And like I did fad diets with my mom throughout middle school and high school. And -</p> - and like eventually, I got to the point where I was like fuck dieting. This is stupid. But I mean on both sides of my family, all of the women are heavy set. Like all of them. I don't have a single skinny relative. And also, even at my healthiest, when I was working out, you know, five days a week, and eating nothing but vegetables from my farm share, and, you know, local free range, blah, blah, blah meat and -</p> - cooking everything myself. Like I was still a size 16. Like, there is (laughter) - and it wasn't dieting, but it was eating, primarily eating whole foods, home-cooked, like -<br></p> - doing everything right according to the health experts, and like my muscle to fat ratio was higher, like a much higher density, but I was still pretty big, and ... yeah. And like and on the one hand, I understand that a lot of these things are genetically determined. There's not a whole lot you can do. There's also the evidence that when I was, you know, doing the right things like ... [00:38:12]</p> Like I'm never going to be a size 4 model, you know, but there still - I don't know. A lot of things would be easier for me if I were skinnier. And it's really hard not to feel frustrated about that. And also, like conflating legitimate concerns. Like I get out of breath more easily because I haven't been working out for two years, and I really should go to the gym for health reasons. Like conflating that with you're a fat, ugly slob, and you're worthless because you're fat, and like those - like some of these things are valid and some of these things are not.</p> But they get conflated and like -</p> - it's (sigh) ...</p> Yep. Definitely. [00:39:05]</p> I really ... I don't know. I don't know if I could say that I've ever liked the way I look. Like there's always things I hate about the way I look, but there is definitely a - when I was working out regularly, and I could see defined muscles, like I could flex and see my biceps or, you know, looking at my back in the mirror, I could see muscles on my back. Like that was, you know, definitely a source of pride of, you know, I have worked at this and look at how strong I am. Roar and yeah. [00:40:30]</p> He tries.</p> It doesn't sink in.</p> I mean most of the people I've had intimate relationships with have been friends first, and none of them are what I'd describe as conventionally attractive, so like, ... so I don't know. I guess the answer to that is no. People I've been with haven't really helped because the - the things that attracted us, that - that brought us together weren't looks to start out with. [00:41:49]</p> Right. So I don't know if that makes any sense, but ...</p> I guess I've always assumed that the people I've been with are with me for my personality and not for my looks, and, you know, that's fine and ... [00:42:05]</p> Yeah, but - you can be attracted to someone without thinking they're pretty.</p> Like I mean attractive and beautiful are -</p> - are - are - are - are different.</p> Right.</p> Yeah.</p> I will do my best to remember to call one friend. I'm sorry.</p> Okay.</p>",0
1004687686.txt,"So. Babies are hard.</p> (laughing) As it turns out. I knew — yeah.</p> Yeah. And she's at the stage where she's very, very clingy with Heather Kate. Because — I didn't mess with it because she's in a different environment. So Heather will put her on the floor so that she can put her clothes on, and she'll scream. And it's like aaahhh. It's actually very funny because she's a great kid. And when she's crying or pseudo-tantrum, she's just collapsing on the floor.</p> I'm like, ""You know, I wish I could do that. I know how you feel Violet.""</p> ""If she's fussy, let her be fussy."" But we can't really do that. And then Kirsten's friend Casey is here also to kind of take care of Kirsten. So the timing turned out to kind of suck. Heather is wonderful. (pause) She's just very, very understanding.</p> So she was just like, ""Okay. Here's the plan. We can deal with this,"" very matter of fact.</p> (pause) Yeah. So I'm really happy she's here, and I'm really happy to see her. But it's also hard. (pause).</p> And she's always been this incredibly generous-hearted person who — I don't know. She's just fantastic. It's nice to be with her (pause) I'm a little jealous.</p> Not like (pause) I don't really have reason to be jealous because she — her life is hard. But the first medication she tried made a huge difference. She takes Prozac and it works — and it just works, and that's all there is to it. (chuckles) (pause)</p> Anorexia and bulimia.</p> She was bulimic when we were in high school, which I didn't know about until later. But even when I knew about it, I didn't say anything to people, which I was guilty of that for years and years and years. It's taken me a long time to realize I could not have saved her. I just couldn't have done it.</p> It's not gone. It's not ever going to be gone. But it — I don't know. (pause) I don't know why I can't do that. (pause) Why I have not done that yet. But it feels like I can't. (pause) (sigh)</p> Scared about having kids. Yeah, Heather's also great because she's not very sentimental at all. So she's both — she's very upfront about both saying — like she really wanted this kid. She had two miscarriages before she had Violet.</p> They were both incredibly hard for her. She's both like, ""This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me, the best thing in my life, the person I love more than anybody else. I love her more everyday and am so happy. And my God, she's a pain in the ass."" (laughing)</p> I'm just like, ""Heather, I'm proud about both of those things."" (laughing) It's very refreshing. Particularly because my sisters-in-law can't really — they are not willing to say the ""My God, she's a pain in the ass"" part about their children</p> It's kind of like everybody has to bow down at the baby altar, sort of thing. And I do. I like babies. And I'm pretty good with them. I like babies in the way that I like other people. I like some babies more than others. But I get along with most people like I get along with most babies.</p> (pause) But Heather Kate isn't offended when I compare training Violet to training my dog. (laughing) She's like, ""Yes, they are basically dogs.""</p> She has dogs, so she also is like — she is the crazy dog person. They are her family.</p> But, in a way that — I have never bonded with animals that way. (chuckle) It's nice.</p> But it's just exhausting. She didn't sleep well last night, so I didn't sleep well last night.</p> Yeah. (pause) I was talking with Heather on the train ride over about work and graduate school. She started her Ph.D. program either a year before me, no in the same year that I started my master's program. She mastered out. She did two years of it and was like, ""Fuck this. I'm done."" She doesn't like research. She doesn't like writing papers. She doesn't want it.</p> Classics.</p> So she got a master's degree, and is teaching high school now, loves it and is super happy doing that. We were kind of talking about the (exhale) different options, different challenges of graduate school, and she was like, ""I just didn't like writing papers."" And I was like, ""See that's the difference between you and me. I really like writing papers."" The only thing I'm really hanging onto this year is that I really want to give this paper at the SBL (ph? [00:11:47]). I really want to be in shape to write the paper and give it because I'm excited about the idea.</p> As we got off the train, she was like, ""You know, you have seemed happier talking about your work than I have seen you all weekend."" (pause)</p> (pause) I've been thinking a lot about just saying, ""Fuck this,"" and leaving school and teaching. (crying) I don't know. But yeah, I do love research.</p> (crying) I just want to be well enough to do any of the things that give me joy.</p> And I'm not. (pause/crying) I hate how selfish depression makes me. I hate it so much. I can't (pause) I can't think outside myself anymore.</p> It's my birthday today.</p> Thanks. I almost didn't pick up the phone when my dad called to wish me happy birthday because I just didn't want to talk to anybody. (crying) I hate that. (pause)</p> And I hate that I can't think about — I hate that I resent them for having these problems. Not problems, but having these other issues. Because all I want to do is be quiet. (pause/crying) I feel like — it just makes me feel ugly. I'm not that happy with myself today. (crying) I hate how self-pitying I've become.</p> Yeah. (crying)</p> Yeah. And I haven't been uncontrollably upset in the last couple of days. I've kind of kept it together, but I'm probably going to pay for it tomorrow. I don't know. (pause)</p> I like Karen fine, I would be very happy to have lunch with her, not today. It's hard for me to remember, she could have called me as well as I could have called her (laughing). I have to keep that in mind.</p> (long pause) [00:19:58]</p> The baby took a nap. The parents took a nap. I took a nap. (laughing)</p> That was really important. All we've done is - I'd said I wanted to go to church, and so we've gone downtown. The original plan was to go to the morning service because they have a nursery, and we could put Violet in the nursery and Heather could go to church. Then she was just like, ""You know, I'm going just walk around.""</p> So they hung out on the commons for a little bit, then I came in and hung out with them some. Then we went back home, and I was so tired I was about to cry. (laughing)</p> (pause) Yeah. (pause)</p> (pause) Heather is going to leave in the morning, hopefully after rush hour. I don't know when rush hour even ends, so I don't when the best time for her to leave would be. (pause)</p> Of June. (laughing) So I'll probably be gone that week. (laughing). We're just going to rent a cabin by a lake and do some hiking...</p> ...and ignore everybody for a while.</p> (laughing) That's my kind of vacation. I'm really excited about it, but there's more to plan. Yeah. (pause)</p> But everything gets done somehow. (pause) Things just keep going.</p> I wish they would not.</p> Oh just — you know you climb one mountain. Then go down, and then there's another one. All of the things you dread. They happen, or they don't happen. You know, (pause) like I always think I'm going to fail out, but I get all my papers written and the semester ends, and then I go on to the next thing. (pause)</p> What do you mean?</p> Yeah...</p> Because it doesn't matter how much that part screams, I still have shit to do. (crying) Things don't go away. The world doesn't care how upset I am.</p> (crying) Yeah.</p> Yeah. (pause)</p> I'm sorry?</p> (laughing) No. I can't read the news. I haven't been able to for a couple of years now. (pause) I think the world is coming to an end. (laughing) It stresses me out too much. I just can't deal with it. And then well-meaning people say that it's the responsibility of every citizen to be up-to-date on the news and stuff. Fuck you. (laughing)</p> Sorry I just can't care. Because I can't do it right now. (pause)</p> I don't feel that much.</p> It's more — it's just, ""Let's add 50 more insolvable problems on to the things that I feel responsible for.""</p> Yeah. (pause) This year as a new year's resolution I decided I was not going to buy any new clothes this year. I was going to either make them or buy them in a thrift store, because all of my clothes are made by slaves. And I can't do anything about that. Even doing what I am doing, it's like, ""Well, now the fabric you buy is made by slaves."" (laughing)</p> And I can't do anything about that. (pause) It's like it's only possible for me to maintain the fiction that I have any control over my own life when I don't read the news. (laughing)</p> Yeah. (pause) But it's like when I stop and I listen to the part of me that is despairing and upset and angry and crying, (sigh) stuff doesn't get done. You know? (crying/pause) I don't feel myself becoming any less upset or angry or despairing, it's just that (pause)...</p> Probably yeah. It's like all of that kind of is the framework .That's there and I know it's there. And it kind of goes without saying, but I can't pay very much attention to it. (pause) Or I will never find an apartment, and I will starve to death. (pause)</p> (laughing)</p> Yeah.</p> I don't feel like I can afford to let it matter. Yeah. (pause) (sigh/sniffling) Unfortunately, it matters whether I like it or not, evidenced by the fact that I cannot work. (laughing).</p> But you know, just saying, ""Okay, that's fair. That's fine. I'm going to go about my business anyway,"" has sort of worked, most of the time, for so long that I don't know what else to do. (pause)</p> Yeah. I mean I feel like has hijacked my life.</p> (pause) And that I (pause) you know, I'm working pretty hard. And that anything that I can think of to do, I'll try to do. But I don't know how — I don't know how to get past this. I don't know how to get better. (pause) Yeah. I would like to be at a place in my life where I could — yeah — where I could have a child, where I could have a job or a career, rather. Where I could ...</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> Yeah, and it's like the very small things that I'm trying to do for myself right now that I have to do. I have to find a place to live. I have to find a job. I have to be with people in a good way. I have to eat. I feel like even those things I'm not going to be able — I can't do if I pay attention to the part of me that's really sad (crying). (pause) Yeah. Yeah. (pause/crying)</p> How do you mean? (crying)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. It's more like I will say, ""Okay. Here is my sadness. But if I'm going to give this to you, then I have to take care of you while you have it.""</p> You know, (pause) I kind of asked my friend just to come take care of me for a couple of days.</p> But now that she's here, I want to take care of her more than ever.</p> With James, I spend time with James actually being sad, which I don't really with anybody else.</p> But (pause) I keep wanting to say, ""I'm so sorry that this is so hard for you."" I want to take care of him because ""It must be so hard for you to hear this from me. It's so hard for you that this is hard for me."" (pause)</p> Yeah. We talked about that more explicitly last night or the night before last. And I think that was good because he has said a couple of times, ""Yeah. It's hard for me to deal with you being depressed."" And so the fact that I now apologize all the time, he thought that was coming from him. I was like, ""No, no, no that's all me."" (laughing)</p> It is. It's hard. He just will always say, ""Yeah it's hard for me to hear, but it's not as hard as it is for you to live with it,"" which I hear. (pause).</p> Wishing he could take it away. Yeah.</p> That makes sense. I don't feel guilty about foisting it on you because you don't have to have this job. (laughing)</p> (laughing) Clearly you want to be here. So... yeah.</p>",2
1004687692.txt,"This pillow is a lot more comfortable than it looks.</p> Oh just this pillow is much more comfortable than it looks.</p> Okay?</p> Yeah I feel like when I have been doing pretty well for 24 hours or so I - like then I feel my sessions don't go as well.</p> I don't know quite why. The current theory is that when I'm having a good day I don't want to think about the things that make me not have a good day. I tend to be fairly kind of - I don't know - evasive; focused on the present, trying to kind of get things done. Today is a day of trying to get things done. I have a job interview today. [00:01:25]</p> Yeah for part-time research assistant. I'm probably not going to get it because it's in the professors in contemporary art, and I have absolutely no background in that. So if he has one person who wants to work for him who has any background, he's probably not going to pick me. All I can say is well I learn things pretty fast and pretty much any topic you throw at me I'm going to get pretty excited about. (inaudible at 00:02:06). So I'm (pause) anyhow planning how it will go in my mind at which, of course, it will not go at all like that. You know having imaginary conversations that I expect to happen in the next few days or the conversations that have already happened but I kind of wished went differently. (Pause) I did a lot of playwriting in college and... [00:02:53]</p> (Pause) I don't know. I like having conversations. (Pause) Yeah, this is still a little scary. (Laughter)</p> I'm more comfortable with a clearer role from (inaudible at 00:03:44). Although I mean when I was in the hospital both times what pissed me off more than anything were types of nurses, especially the people who worked there, who made this very clear I am in the role of care giver and you are in the role of sick person. And were very clear about what they wanted me to be. That they expected me to - I don't know - be sick in some specific way. Or not so much that they expected me to be doing anything active but that they expected me not to be capable in some way. I just got tired of people taking a side and saying pour out your troubles to me and I'll fix them. [00:04:55]</p> Or talking to me like I was an idiot. But I talked to... I mean after a couple of instances of what I thought was extraordinarily condescending behavior I talked to other patients and they did not seem bothered by it like they didn't seem to notice. So maybe it was just me. (Pause) I don't know maybe I'm just more either used to being the expert or used to being around people who consider themselves an expert and I pay attention to. [00:06:12]</p> And at the end of it James was like I don't think that guy's any smarter than I am. And I'm like why the fuck do you care? (Laughter) Why do you always - it's like measuring penis sizes like why is this important to you? And that's when I think he kind of recognized my criticism but still it's important to him. And I just don't think that intelligence is - you know it's one variable among many, but for him it's the variable. [00:13:14]</p> Yes. Yes. When I feel like he's calling that into question, I get really pissed off. And partly because it's such a dramatic reversal of the ways that he typically values me. And in part because... I don't know. I have this impulse to be easily cowed that he knows is kind of one of those things that got trained into me of if somebody says no you're wrong I say well okay I'm probably wrong unless I know I'm right, and then I dig my heels in, and I don't go anywhere. [00:15:46]</p> She's like but if I have to constantly tell you what I need then... But she was talking about how much she is very forthright, very confident, says what she means from everybody except for Diego. And that when Diego disagrees with her she says okay we'll do that. She caves immediately, always. (Pause) I don't know. [00:18:03]</p> I would believe him. (Pause) Have you read ""Flowers for Algernon""?</p> I think there's a movie about it, but I only read the book. I read it. It's about a man who's mentally retarded who volunteers for an experiment that makes him kind of super human intelligence. Like he grows to the point where he has surpassed all of the scientists who performed the study that made him intelligent and finds that there are errors in the procedure that are going to lead to this process being reversed. And it's told in diary forms and it follows him going from this barely literate, barely functioning adult to this amazingly intelligent man and back down again. And it was a really good book for me to read when I did it and it's like probably in seventh or eighth grade. [00:21:29]</p> Yes.</p> (Laughter) You know that this girl breaks up with him in the first scene of the movie because he thinks he's too smart for her, and she's like you're an asshole. Oh my God. [00:25:06]</p> But it's like well fuck.</p> Yeah. (Laughter) Yeah. I don't know. I thought it wouldn't be a big deal to be really poor for ten years, but it's a bigger deal than I thought it would be. I mean not big that I particularly mind being poor but because - I don't know - when I was 22 it didn't occur to me that I would come down with two life threatening medical conditions for years (laughter) and have... It didn't occur to me that I might be committing myself to a career path where I have to wait ten years to have a kid and maybe not even then. And everyone will respect me less for having children. It really didn't occur to me because I suck at money and had no financial training whatsoever. Actually it's a good idea to start saving for retirement when you're still in your 20's. I just thought oh life will be fine. [00:27:36]</p> No, less so. I do find it easier to talk.</p> Yeah. Now that you've brought it up I'm like well is this seat for Chad? I don't know. Am I doing this right? (Laughter) Oh...</p> (Laughter) Also it's going to be awkward when I start crying because then it was like everything's bringing us back down.</p> Oh no. Now I'm feeling (inaudible at 00:29:04)</p> Yeah. No, this is helpful.</p> I mean it's very different because you are talking less and (pause) I don't like that. [00:29:38]</p> Yeah. Okay.</p> Okay. I think that's partially a change in venue. Partially I'm not coming in today with here's today crisis fix it please. Yeah, so that's good. [00:30:25]</p> So yesterday you said or you asked so I don't think that I will get better. And so I guess what I've been thinking about for a few days, a week, is that there's always two sides to a statement like that. You know I'm always saying I have no options and the other side of that is please tell me more options. I don't think I will get better and the other side is please let me get better. [00:31:23]</p> (Pause) I found out there's probably not actually a causal connection here but I feel as though the more openly optimistic I am about something the more crushing it becomes when it doesn't work. Maybe this is the other side of optimism. Optimism expresses the opposite.</p> I don't know that that's actually true in that I really do most of the time just not... But it's like there's always these unsolvable problems that somehow get solved, but I don't understand how. [00:32:52]</p> Well (pause) you know like my senior year my second semester I had six English term papers to write in 12 days. And it's like how the fuck am I going to do that and I did it. It happened. It just did. It happened. (Pause) And with the depression before this I've always gotten better but there's no clear causal link. I don't know why I get better. I don't know how. [00:33:45]</p> The well part of the not well part?</p> Yes. I feel like different people. I can't remember what it is... It's very difficult to remember what it is like to not be well when I am well. And usually I remember it by describing it to myself or somebody else and then by the end of the description I'm not well. Yeah. (Pause) I'm not wanting to think very hard. Oh my gosh, what to do? [00:36:01]</p> I hadn't thought of that. I am a little anxious about being gone next week. I don't know that that would make me warier of being low here today.</p> Yeah. No I actually left yesterday's session I felt good. I felt better. Afterwards I was like wow that never happens. (Laughter)</p> So yeah. Yeah, I don't know how this week's going to go. I haven't thought much about it actually, or I haven't done much at all. I keep telling myself to be okay with the fact that James is really the one who's putting this together and keep not being entirely successful. (Pause) We're both on the same page again. We basically just want to do things that are easy. Go for a walk, sit and read, hang out. [00:39:27]</p> But... I don't know. (Pause) But when James and I are together (pause) I think we're closer than my parents ever were. I mean I'm fairly certain of that. But... [00:40:44]</p> Thank you. Thanks you too.</p>",1
1004798759.txt,"Um, so today when I left work to come over here—</p> I was having like so, like—periodically I'm having this feeling of (pause) not just really depressed, but... I guess just don't want to go. </p> So it was after I had left work, I was kind of leaving work, frustrated about something, and then when I was walking down the steps, I just wanted to sit down and not like... And it wasn't like not going to therapy, it was just like, I just want to sit down and not do anything? Does that make sense?</p> That was happening a little bit, like, before I left. (pause) It feels kind of weird to me that (clears throat, pause) it doesn't feel like necessarily anything happening that's extremely difficult. Like—I guess it's not like it's a new stressful situation. Does that make sense? </p> I guess I don't want to—I just don't want to. I was so surprised when I felt that in the morning. But also, just, other times, I kind of just want to sit down somewhere and not... I think I just have to deal with just things that I have to do.</p> Um. (pause) I don't know, there was also... Today at work was a lot of (pause) I guess just, like, stupid, like minor irritations, bickerings. Like stupid things happened, I finally had use of the cell phone, I think.</p> And Chet agreed that us meeting every time was, like, weird and stupid, so I was like, ""Yes! That's great!"" He brought it up out of nowhere. But also, there's this conference I wanted to go to that Chet wanted to send me to.</p> Yeah. And so, Chet talked to HR, and their response was, well, I'm not really an employee, I'm just positional, the Fair Labor Act says you can't send me to a conference because the conference might run more than seven hours, and I only get paid for seven hours of work. So I can't go. (clears throat) Yeah. I can, however, work an additional fourteen hours the next two weeks, and then bank that time, and then use that. (clears throat) Yeah. Which (pause) is really don't—and my other thing is, I can't report it in our time management system because it would be overtime. They don't formulate bank hours.</p> It's this weird, convoluted—and so Chet's going to be away for the next two or three weeks. And my temptation is, well, I could just say I worked an extra forty hours. And not. </p> Because no one would know. And I'm debating that. (sighs) Because I think it's really stupid. The other thing that has been frustrating to me is—you people put your problems to me, and lately I've had a lot of bad people say, ""Well, it doesn't work."" And when I ask for details, they get really frustrated and say, ""It doesn't work, it doesn't work, it doesn't work."" </p> And I'm like, ""Well, did you try..."" ""It doesn't work."" So... and so far every single time I've played on the computer, I've fixed it, so it's super frustrating. Um... and so today, I noticed one of the scanners has got a weird out of order sign. It's got a scan but one, you're supposed to date it and put your initials next to it, so I didn't know what happened and who reported it to me, and then there are these weird signs that like, you know, ""This machine is not working properly. This machine is broken. IT, we ask that you please repair it ASAP."" Normally it just says, ""The machine is out of service. This machine is not working. It will be serviced. Call for service,"" stuff like that. And the signs, do you know we disagreed about that? So at first I couldn't find who put the signs up, and I asked around and no one knew. So I'm like, ""Okay, this like, bugs. Who cares who put up signs?"" But this was printed out, so it was kind of weird. And then one of the signs was on the wall on the thing, and at least one of the computer signs had not been there on Monday, when I was done but were there on Tuesday, which was also weird. </p> And so that was part of it. For a little while I was sitting, going over this e-mail, asking the question like, ""Why did you do this?"" when I'm not going to get an answer I like. And the other thing which some library employees have started doing is refusing to troubleshoot any scanners, printers, or computers, because they feel that it's not in the job description, and because they're already overworked, they shouldn't troubleshoot. They should just put up the sign, and maybe call IT and find out. It's their form of protest against being overworked. </p> But... (pause)</p> Yeah.</p> I mean, there are other areas that aren't mine that are doing it, but yeah, they're doing it up and down my side. I get to deal with it. (pause) And also, I'm pretty sure they're... I mean, the expectation is they're supposed to try something. Like before putting an out of order sign. Especially something that super people use. </p> I actually wasn't so much not wanting to go to therapy.</p> That wasn't the thing it was for me.</p> It was... I was just thinking like, ""Okay, well, after therapy I have to pick up my furniture, my new chair, bring it home, and I have to do all these things.""</p> And I guess I just really don't want to—like it's more like there's these things I have to do tonight, and I don't want to do any of them. And like, walking to here is sort of like, the beginning of the things I have to do this evening.</p> But it's not actually the therapy part that was...</p> Yeah. I mean, we could probably say it's what comes after.</p> Yeah.</p> Like other times I feel that way, it's very much like, you know, I don't want to leave the house because leaving the house means I have to walk to the bus stop and go to work and do these things, and then come back from work and do these other things. And I just want to—I just don't want to do any of it. </p> Yeah. (pause) And also just this moment of, if I just sit down, and don't go, like physically move, then I don't have to worry about it. These things I don't want to do. It's like there won't be consequences. </p> What I want to do, I guess, is just sit down, not go, and just have everything get done, and have it not be a problem.</p> Yeah.</p> And it's also kind of despairing, you know what I mean? As well. It's just like (pause) it wouldn't help me to try and think, okay, well, how am I doing? What's going on? And (pause) you know, it's almost like I could cry. If I could—I know I say that a lot, but I would just be a mess. And the other thing circulating was, um (pause) overwhelmed. It just seemed like even though none of these things are difficult, and each individual thing is fine, it just feels like there's just too many things to do and not enough time, and I don't feel like (pause) I'm not sure I'm capable of doing it all. (pause, shifts) It makes more sense to me when it's the morning and I have to go to work.</p> But this is like, I wasn't getting upset, I wasn't upset about coming here, getting my new chair, I get it from friends who I can go and talk to, so like I get to go on the bus, pick it up and go home, and then there's... Yeah, nothing difficult. And they're things that I like. Or at least just (sighs)...</p> (shifts) I feel like I'm battling to get out this feeling, usually, actually now, like I find myself, like my eyes are red and I start tearing up. But I don't feel upset at anything (cries). Well, I mean, that's not true. But I don't know—I'm not really sure what's making me feel oh so upset, and I start crying about it. Does that make sense? The feeling of crying is separate from the emotional part.</p> Yeah, it's just weird. It's kind of upsetting.</p> (sighs) (crying) I don't cry a lot, and I don't let myself cry a lot. And usually when I do, I'm super upset about something. So (pause) I'm like, okay, I'm crying, which means... it should mean that I'm really upset about something, but I don't, I don't know what the thing is.</p> (shifts) (sniffles) Maybe, um... (pause) It's partially that, and also like, I guess I'm scared that if I stop and take care of myself that I won't be able to (pause) I guess stop. Being scared. It's a slippery slope of, ""Well, if I take this day as my off day, will I take tomorrow off the same way? And this day, and that day?"" (pause)</p> (inaudible)</p> It was, um, it wasn't a surprise. I did find it—I wasn't surprised that she hated going to therapy. That's just going to happen. I was surprised at how intensely angry she was, though. (crying) Um, one she was talking about was how people are like, oh, you know, we're sort of supporting people doing things that Ashby probably thought were very small. Like, ""You left your house this weekend. Good job."" And (pause) she was mad because she was like, ""I go to work every day, and you know, it doesn't drop.""</p> (blows nose)</p> Yes (crying).</p> Yeah. And also I think that I don't like the idea of (pause) being one passive-aggressive coworker away from (pause) like... one passive-aggressive coworker is what I can cope with today, ordinarily that's not good. </p> I don't want to be one passive-aggressive coworker away from a crying bathroom or just being really upset. </p> Um, (pause) And no, I think it's more (pause) I guess it's kind of like, I can't be really upset because there's all these things that I have to do, so (pause) I have things that need to get done. Responsibilities. I feel like I won't be able to feel ultimately responsible at the end of the week. I can't look any better.</p> Okay. And can I pay for the extra session on Monday? The extra session?</p> No, I want to pay in a week.</p> The session that I missed on Monday. </p> Okay. I'll see you.</p>",1
1004798771.txt,"Okay. No big deal.</p> That's not an issue, so. So trying to figure out where to start. Trying to decide between the person that I turned in to the police for carrying weapons on the bus is now stalking me and intimidating me. Yes, that's where I just literally came from. That's why I was like I just need some quiet time. He found me—I didn't know what was happening. I get tapped on the shoulder, smooshed on the side of the bus, the whole—yes. At this point if I didn't know better I would think I was just hallucinating shit but I know it's not. It was just a freaking scary situation.</p> Yes.</p> Did I tell you about this guy that having gotten on with his friend with it...</p> Yes, yes, yes, the police picked him up because I guess he had an ankle monitor which made it a lot easier for them to find him.</p> And he was back on the bus. And of all the places he—and I wasn't looking; I was using my iPod, listening. And I got tapped on the shoulder so I slide over to the side with the glass and there he was. And...</p> Yes but there's all these I-have-rage-problem types of things of getting—doing this and cracking his knuckles and going—you know what I mean? Like all these slightly aggression, kind of like leaning into you, doing these little intimidation tactics bullshit things.</p> Yes. So ...</p> Not a word. And then I just sat there and I waited until everybody got off the bus. I mean he got off the bus first; he even had the little card he was carrying on last time. And I just waited until everybody got off the bus and I couldn't see anybody else around before I got off the bus. I made sure everybody was vacated before I—including him—because I just did not want to—yes. I mean he was doing a lot of things that made you think that he might be a little paranoid, I don't know. I was just like oh God, not this now. I don't need this now. So, yes. He very deliberately—I can tell now. He did it because he recognized me and he wanted to intimidate me. [00:02:33]</p> He didn't show me anything like that but he did look very aggressive, very I-want-to-make-sure-you-know-that-I-know-who-you-are kind of behavior. </p> I was pretty scared. I texted my husband briefly to let him know that—at first it was I think it is this guy, yes it is this guy. That kind of stuff. I'm kind of scared. This and that. And then there was a certain commotion coming down from that. So now when I get done with this I'm going to go try to tell the police officer that did the report and all that stuff I have to let him know that he's doing that. I mean I can't forbid him from being on the bus but there's got to be something they can—to make sure he's not intimidating people like me. Yes, it was just not one of my high points. Oh God. That's not even the scariest part of the week. </p> Yes, yes. I don't know. I've got to, Friday morning we've got to drive back to Cincinnati. I'm going with some people that I knew in school. Is a un—how do I explain this? It is a little bit of a secret but it's known by several people that Sarah killed herself. Yes. </p> Yes. Last time I checked they were working on making sure that this was ruled as inconclusive as to what was the cause of death and it's possible. </p> I don't know. Something she took. Yes. So, because her parents will not take that well. They keep pushing off when the funeral's going to be because the body hasn't been released by the medical examiner. So now it's looking like it might be Sunday, I think. Yes. [00:04:53]</p> Yes, and that leads to something even weirder than that. It's just been such a freaking nightmare with everything with that. I've actually— I should start on a positive note, through. I have made the executive decision that I don't want to have anything, anything—actually I should probably explain this—I don't want anything to do with any of my in-laws any more, at all. Ever. Dave's okay with that and I said and I don't want any of our children ever to—I've been trying to play this moral high ground. I'm not trying to pressure you to do one thing or the other but I just can't handle any of this any more. </p> Well I had called her just to give kind of give her a little bit of a heads up that a mutual friend of Dave and I had committed suicide and also that there's actually been some suicides at Dave's work over the past few months.</p> Yes. Two of them at the Institute, and that's been over the past year, still.</p> Two suicides at the Institute.</p> That's the medical—it's a joint thing with the schools. That's where technically he's supposed to be. But they've had one grad student and one post-op commit suicide. And disturbingly enough my husband's being treated by the psychiatrist, at the very least from what we understand that's the first time. We were like I think that's that psychologist that was treating one of the girls that committed suicide too.</p> One of those people, yes. Yes. We haven't had that officially confirmed but he used to see her in the waiting room occasionally and she's dead now so you know.</p> Yes. So anyway, I just wanted to kind of—his stepmother is a licensed psychiatrist. She's a practicing therapy—I don't know. Something...</p> Something like that. Something that has some kind of hokey master's degree kind of that you can get through the mail or online these days, yes. And she has some other things too. But, you know, I just wanted to sort of put it on her radar because Dave's, there's a lot going on with him. I felt that they should really know this just because I don't really believe he's suicidal but I think that right now he's bleak. He is very—he has so much, he's so flat, he's zoning out. I mean so flat that nothing makes him happy, not food, not his favorite shows, he's so flat that he's really making me worried. And she said some things to me that really bothered me. </p> That's where he works. I mean, yes, it is a big building but that's not the building.</p> Yes. And that's one of the ways statistically, that 1 percent of the people who have appointments, is in that group is now dead because of 200 people, 2 people dead, yes. And then she sort of kind of implied that Sarah sort of made her own choices and that we have to respect them and that's sad but there's nothing that we could've done or—and I understand being told there's nothing you could've done, but more or less...</p> I mean they're aware that all of us have a little bit of guilt but not the same thing. It's the oh I should have, and it's not like we ever thought we would keep anything from happening but it's regrets that you have when anybody passes away. [00:10:08]</p> Yes, and Dave looks up to her husband and...</p> And then I find out that they had bouts with infertility and—I mean this whole thing, there's a lot of things like this. And I thought you know what? And the funny thing is, is that one of the things that's really upsetting him the most is the fact that she was what he perceived to be mean to her when we were in college. It's actually now that this is all coming out and we're finding this out it's actually that she was very insecure because of lots of reasons. Like technically she was at the school across the way and just crossed the registration thing and she always felt like she was inferior to certain people. But she always liked him; she just was on guard a little bit and she didn't feel as comfortable. </p> Yes, because you don't break confidences on that kind of stuff. But he felt like these are things that really ought to be known. It's not like she would—she probably wouldn't have minded. [inaudible at 00:12:03]. But you don't immediately go and tell somebody that. So he mentioned—I talked a little bit about sometimes she's a little bit hostile but it really wasn't the fact that—it's more that she was just on guard or being—she was so used to being told how dumb she was. Not by any of us but people in her life that she was a little bit on guard when she was around certain people.</p> Yes. And so but yet she didn't—she knew us and we liked her but she was always a little bit—she never really felt good about herself. And knowing this and knowing now that it was an obviously long, life-long depression, never feeling like she was worthy of anything, this reflects a lot on his mood. He sees this. He—Dave's never handled—He feels like he's an imposter amongst others. A lot of people perceive him as being angry when he's just nervous or—you know what I mean? I was told I ought to tell her this stuff and she basically made me feel like crap afterwards for ever—all I wanted to do was personally put it on her radar because he pretends to be something different when he's on the phone. He just does that; it was learned behavior. </p> Yes. Well I've met other people that inaudible at 00:14:52] like when I had to switch...</p> My friend John said I should just tell people my sister-in-law died because it's true. I mean it was my—I was involved in this fraternity; she was involved with the fraternity. It's a fraternity that's married to the public. He said just tell people your sister-in-law died; it'll be a lot easier for them to understand. And it kind of works that way but you know what I mean, it has a very close feeling towards that. But it's just—it just made me feel so freaking atrocious. And then she had to bring up work at that point and how much Dave's dad is looking forward to his new phone, along with a couple of other things. I think she was just trying to make small talk to sort of ease the way out, that kind of thing. And I was just like I was so mad at myself because you know what? They would never, literally never call me if I didn't initiate anything and I don't initiate very often at all. </p> And I'm just done. I'm really done. And the worse thing is I don't ever, ever want those people to have anything to do with our children, biological or not. One because they're so freaking flippant about the possibilities of ever having children because they're—like the whole concept of well I don't think that the people—his mother or his stepmother saying things like I don't' think it's a really good idea for you guys to adopt but I guess the people at the adoption agency will figure that out. Like—because Dave's depression. I'm like you know what? Dave, I mean, everything is like, everything—I have to occasionally feel like I have to pause and turn to other people if they're around and think did I just hear this? Is there—am I just making shit up or am I escalating this more than it needs to be? And as far as I can tell I'm not, maybe slightly but if I did I'm remembering reverse word order that makes it slightly more dramatic. But things are not like—I mean this is so freaking screwed up.</p> But it is and I'm okay with that. And I'm not sure I'll want to talk to people about it because most people don't get—I mean I tried for years, went through a lot of questions, and I've just got to get an easy story straight. Not like a lie but something that's simple and easy for people to understand because everyone wants to know. Oh, you're going to see them? When are you guys going to visit? I say never, never. [00:18:18]</p> He has to make his own decision for the rest of it. I try not to pressure him. That's the biggest reason why I let myself be hurt over and over again is I never want to be that spouse who makes you stop talking to people. But you know what? It just—it's just that bad. It's just that bad.</p> And so—you know it—the whole thing is just so, I don't know. Everything about them is just so—there's something broken and disturbing and that's been haunting me for a really long time. At one point Dave—something led to another, led to another, so he decided to look up—his mother gave her house to Dave's sister when, right about the time that we got married. </p> Yes, we got married. So the issue is she's having her baby and all this other stuff and so she gave it to them. In theory she was going to be paying them an amount for her rent but you know that stuff never really happens. And whatever it was it would never be the right amount.</p> No, no. Dave's mother moved away at that time I think she was somewhere and gave the—oh that's right, she wasn't living there and gave the house to Dave's sister. So Dave's sister's living in their childhood home for free because you make a couple small payments and then you kind of forget about it the rest of your life. But, yes so anyway she's living there and he looked up and I don't remember exactly. He explained to me what it was that led to this. I think it had something to do with the limited weather or something like that. [00:20:33]</p> Because they make me think that I'm acting like a drama queen and therefore when does a drama queen hyperventilate over something that happened in 1998 and throwing up in a trash can over something that happened in 1998? That definitely sounds like a drama queen thing to do. That and I don't know.</p> I mean I have nightmares—if I let myself, I will become a freaking basket case over it. And so I think that talking about it doesn't make it any better. I think talking about it just aggravates it more. And I'm not believing that it's it for all things but I think that that is—there's nothing that I can do or say—because I talked about it a lot—nothing I can do or say to make it any better and I never, ever thought that any of this behavior was okay, ever. And so...</p> It was very, very traumatic. I don't think I can explain this because it sounds ridiculous to say that kind of thing but if I let myself I can get myself really, really upset about the whole thing. And so I was angry that I let somebody do this to me. And I was just kind of frustrated so—more than kind of frustrated. I'm just so over all of this, I can't handle any more of it. And quite frankly the few things that my family have said that they know about and that kind of thing for what they—because they have to translate it into something that they can understand. They're not really good with dysfunction; they don't really understand it very well.</p> They actually can't though, with them. They just don't get it. They don't understand at all. And that's why I don't give them a whole lot of details. They just cannot fathom—they don't think it's like—they can't translate saying oh there must be something else in the story or anything like that. They just don't get it. The only thing that they do kind of understand is why they don't, no one takes care of Dave and his family.</p> I think that they don't—I don't let them know enough of it to be horrified about it. I mean what—I think that they think that because of, they think that my parents are taking care of him therefore they don't need to take care of him. That's the only thing that they can really understand. And the idea of okay, Debra's parents got it, they're closer. They got that one. They got other kids, my parents only had one kid, that's the only thing that they can even remotely understand. I've talked with my dad about why he never did anything to do with family law or anything, any of that kind of stuff, because he just he couldn't handle it. The sheer concept of dealing with any of that kind of stuff is just...</p> It's upsetting. He has no idea—he can't understand why in the world people would behave in the way that they did and he felt like he couldn't adequately represent clients because he couldn't be able to understand enough about their motivations. He couldn't put himself in their shoes at all. Why in the world would you ever do that? And so he just refused to have anything to do with that kind of stuff. And it just—they love Dave so much. I mean they're not always so good about it. And they actually admit, we didn't raise boys so we don't really understand what guys like for Christmas or whatever but they do just fine.</p> Yes, exactly, yes. And they're very funny about it, too. But it's—overall they look pretty good. They're lives—they just, and to be honest I don't really want to make them sad about it because I think they will be very upset to know that their daughter's been going through this without saying anything to them. [00:28:09]</p> I mean I'll let them know that I'm under a lot of stress but I don't want to—they just don't need the details. There's certain things you can't unhear.</p> Some things you can't unhear.</p> Also it's one use of privacy of details.</p> They'd be awful supportive of me but they would also—I know that my mom would be very much upset that I let myself get beat, taken advantage of. Not upset with me but just upset in general, sort of troubled. And, I don't know, like I said I just—there's few people that really know about what's going on. One of the first persons we're going to pick up along the way, she says you know if you actually really understand the whole background of Dave's family, there are two different directions he could've turned out. Then of course she doesn't hold back, she's a civil engineer so she knows everything. She said he could've been in one of her kids that liked her animals and turned out to be a psycho, or he could've turned out to be completely different than everybody else in the family and very sensitive person. I'm glad he's not the psycho. But she says but for a like a couple of things he could've turned out very different and very screwed up. They—the fact that he turned out okay is apparently okay because no harm no foul. [00:30:34]</p> I'm not even going to have anything to do with them to tell them I'm not going talk to because why bother because they would never know.</p> Yes, why would I tell them that? I mean they don't care. Not only that, but they don't—what is different from being a strange woman than the way it is now? Before I talked to her, I talked to her probably in 2002 on the phone.</p> Yes, yes. But I'm just, like I said I'm exhausted. I need to take care of the people who make me feel good about my life. And they've never made me feel good about me.</p> Yes. For the most part like I said it's not as bad as all that. Like I said, it was just really, really, really acute back in 2000, 1998, and then like I said and part of it was it was so messed up with like I said having my gallbladder removed and all this other stuff happening that I sort of dismissed a lot of it as being also partially due to the stress of this, that and the other thing. [00:32:20]</p> If I think about it, it can be like it's happening to me literally at that second over and over again. That's why I don't want to think about it. I mean I relive it like it's happening in front of me. I don't need that. And maybe that's—I don't know. I want to focus on the people around me that makes me feel good about myself like I said or who actually care about me. And I just feel like I'm done not wasting anything on other people like that. So that's the big things so far. There's about a million other little things that have been going on but...</p> No, no, no. It's a combination of that I'm starting to break things with steroids and also I am, because I've been off of the—because I was sick last week, I went off of the immunosuppressants and I got a big what's call rheumatoid nodule which is basically in the joint a fluid. The [inaudible at 00:33:59] system gets in there and makes a giant cyst-like thing and it's real painful. So if I let anything touch it, it hurts. Unfortunately, I don't know if it'll go away. It may be there permanently, I don't know. I've got to go see the—the ones on my feet are there but they stopped—I mean they hurt but I've stopped being bothered by them. The fact that it's right there makes—I have to keep—I have this on here so that—I turned on my shower and I had screamed bloody murder. I opened up a bottle of—I can't do much of anything else. This is supposed to help me at least until...</p> Yes. Also like I said there's a little bit of a stress fracture in that finger too. So yes, good times. [00:34:45]</p> But yes, like I said it's just one thing after another after another. And none of them are individually are that bad but boy. Oh I forgot to tell you also, I have no bank account. My bank had—what do you call it—a hostile takeover, yes, and, yes, and so—my bank was. And one week they took it over and so basically everyone who had free checking because you had investments with them, they just wrote you a check for what you had and just [inaudible at 00:35:29]. So I found that out Friday. Yes. So I have no checking account. Yes, tomorrow I'll have one.</p> I am concerned that—I don't think he's at risk to hurt himself now. I think that he's at risk right now for over-reflective behavior that can lead to more self-destructive behavior if that makes sense. Doing stupid things, acting out, driving too fast or whatever. Basically being reckless. Thinking, getting stuck in his own head and not seeing the world around him. Possibly with the stupid things that will bring the house down because he's thinking about this and forgets the water is on the stove, that kind of thing. I don't think he's actually at risk for hurting himself right now. But, yes. I think that especially right now, the number one reason why is because he knows, he's seeing what's happening to those survivors and...[00:36:51]</p> Well I mean he's saying that his stress of [inaudible at 00:37:02] not even being able to be near his wife's body because of the coroner's inquest. Can't even bury her. That's a very real thing. I think that inaudible at 00:37:16] that that's—yes.</p> Twice a week, yes. So—and they've been talking about this.</p> Yes, he said he's been talking about it a lot.</p> Yes, yes, yes. The last time I saw that guy was in the [inaudible at 00:38:04] so. On top of it my husband gave me a zip car in theory somewhere in the Square to get me. But that's just mostly so we can get groceries. Ah, got a car on the way, so yes. Oh by the way, just as a quick side note, I don't know if this will make it worse or not if the guy actually asked me what happened to my finger I was actually going to tell him that I was at the range and I had a trigger accident. That could actually work either way. I've got friends that used to do things like women would read gun magazines on their metro to keep people away and it worked out well. [00:38:39]</p> So I actually thought about that. I said you know it could go either way but I was thinking about that but I said if he asks that question I can always say I was at the range practicing and had a trigger accident. By the way I've never actually shot a gun. I've been around them because I [inaudible at 00:39:00]. </p> Oh yes. You shoot your textbook—they're not into shooting any real targets. You shoot your textbooks after you're done with your classes. They have a thing where you can go down there and—yes. It's more about killing your textbook. It could've been what I was worried about too.</p> I'll see you later. Thank you. [00:39:29]</p>",2
1004798765.txt,"Magic. </p> Umm. (pause) So yesterday after I got home—</p> (pause) I don't know, I was (pause) still feeling weird about (pause) my friend potentially not (pause) [inaudible [00:01:11] thought my friends didn't want to hang out with me. Although, for whatever reason, this morning when I woke up, I was like, ""Wow. So that was (pause) really not what was happening,"" which was good.</p> It was nice to wake up and feel a little less crazy about it. Umm. (pause) So one of the—I don't know (sigh) so Ashby and I have our disputes as we do, and (pause) </p> Yes. I don't—we're not (pause) in some ways we're a good roommate match.</p> In other ways we're really not. </p> And those being (pause) her worries that everyone is judging her based on how clean the house is. And by clean, she actually means cluttered. (pause) So if there's anything on the TV stand, it's disgusting and filthy. But if it's not, then it's awesome. The TV stand could be dusty and have cobwebs, but if it's free of things on it, then it's clean. </p> Like we have a broken ironing board that is (pause) in the up stage, in the unfolded stage in the dining room. And I was like, ""Wow. That's kind of—its' broken. We should really get rid of it."" She wanted to get rid of it before, but that was only because Ashby's going to be upset that there's this ironing board in the dining room. And then she started going on about how that was crazy, of course she wouldn't be upset about ironing room—an ironing board. </p> Yes. </p> Yeah. Like with each other. </p> Yeah, she likes to fly off the handle. And I really, really don't like it. (pause) And just sort of the general (pause) she's worried that no one likes her. Sometimes she'll get (pause) like really fixated on that, and then sometimes anything that I do is proof of how much I hate her. (pause) And she won't tell me that and so we're just...</p> So... umm. (pause) I don't really know. But we get along with other things...so. But I do worry that she's—I worry that she's building up anger and resentment and it's going to just explode. In part because (pause) she's mentioned I think her last two housing situations kind of ended with her having a huge fight with her roommate. </p> Right. And I'm like well, ""Then again, one of those times you were 23."" Meh. </p> It's been four years. (pause) Yeah. (long pause)</p> I mean, also I've never lived without roommates, which (pause) I think it was normal. (pause) But periodically I think, ""Oh maybe I should experience life without roommates."" (pause) I don't know like grownups don't have roommates or whatever. I actually thought that. (pause) So initially I was roommates with friends at college. </p> And I decided to experiment with people—like complete strangers from Craigslist. </p> (pause) Yeah. </p> Right</p> Right</p> I do agree with that. </p> Taking up space emotionally or physically does feel (pause) difficult. (pause)</p> I don't (pause) think so, but (pause) I don't know like I have a hard time conceiving about how that would look. </p> I guess then, yes in that that's kind of how I always feel taking—when trying to talk about my feelings with other people. </p> (pause) So I guess yes and no, it's not unique. </p> I don't know. </p> It's just such a (pause) I don't know (pause) like that's pretty much how I talk about things. It's hard to (pause) figure whether it would be more or less so I guess. </p> Although you know I am less worried about imposing or talking a lot about something depressive. (pause). </p> [inaudible [00:16:52] why Ashby hadn't, or why I have a hard time talking with Ashby. </p> When she (pause) she tends to express herself about most things very (pause) intensely. Like really hyperbolically and very...</p> I don't know. </p> Dramatically. Loudly. (pause) Seeing how she's a sports fan and screams at the TV. (pause) and other things, but (pause) so (pause) I don't know. It's—partially I feel like I never know when she's going to suddenly get really—like they'll be some weeks she'll be really angry. (pause) And also just I don't know, it feels really like (pause) I mean, big for lack of a better word (pause). </p> Yeah. </p> And also (pause) her life is never—like nothing satisfies. So </p> Not only does she take up a lot of space, like the more space—like if I give her—I'm like, ""Oh I'll give some more space."" It's like it will extend to fill. </p> Umm (pause). </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. My mom was kind of—is very much like (pause) like she's very big, and then any available room is sort of like she wants at it too. (pause)</p> I don't really know. (pause)</p> Yeah. I think so. </p> Yeah. I mean, (pause) I think that pretty much does describe it, her. I mean, the few times when she does get very like (pause) [inaudible [00:22:12] your feelings. It's like to me, I'm always like, that out of everything that's the things that hurt your feelings and it really bothers her for a long time. </p> But yeah. The way she was around her mother's death was (pause) (sigh) kind of weirdly, grimly closed off. </p> Yeah. Because it was very like (pause) I don't know. (pause) She just—I mean she was (pause) obviously no—she's obviously sad—it was just like (pause) it was really grim and just this like (pause) ""We're not having emotions. We'll have none of this""</p> (pause) And then she was mad at two of her siblings. They had a totally typical sibling fight over (pause) whether one of my aunts respected one of the other aunt's kids for having nonacademic jobs and being sporty. Which I think is an argument they've had for like a decade. My mom was really mad about it. (pause)</p> And she was also (pause) really weird about things that my grandmother wanted like me to have or my brother to have or my other cousins to have. (pause) </p> (pause) But I don't know why. She was just kind of intense about it. </p> Yeah. I feel like sometimes (pause) I'm sort of like, ""Okay guys, let's have emotions."" And my mom's like ""No."" And my dad doesn't really comment. And my brother's like, ""You know. emotions can be good."" (pause) His wife [0:29:39] is really expressive, but she's nice. I no longer feel like the lone crazy person feeling things. (pause) </p> And I was thinking about how (pause) my dad's health is not as good as my mom's. So [inaudible [00:31:08]. (pause) And thinking about him being sick or in the hospital and how it's going to be really just awful to deal with. (pause) Because my mom won't want to- probably won't want to tell my brother and I. Won't want to be upset or sad or just like ""Uhh."" (pause) I don't know. I think my dad would be more likely to sort of express himself. </p> But I'm also—I think, ""What would my mom focus on?"" </p> And uh (pause) It hurts. (pause) (sniffling)</p> Being worried about my mom?</p> Yeah it just—it's hard to think about. Yes, with dad, but also because (pause) they both just don't want to tell us [inaudible [00:33:34] </p> Or they'll like say something six months later. </p> So I feel like—I don't know. It makes me feel like out of (pause) this important thing that's going on that (pause) I mean it was like—I don't know—my mom sort of—the year after my dad first retired, my mom then told me that he was really exhausted and slept all day for like three months. (pause) </p> Yeah. </p> Umm (pause) So (pause) yeah I don't—I feel like my dad is totally someone who would still [inaudible [00:34:36] days forever. </p> So (pause) It's like hard to talk to him about it, talking about his heart. </p> And also (pause) when we have, (pause) my mom usually gets (pause) really mad that we're talking about it. </p> And we'll usually then talk about how she thinks it's stupid to have a gravestone or marker, because you're dead so who cares? (pause) And my brother and I [inaudible [00:35:22] really, ""Well maybe we want to go to your gravestone."" And she just sort of grumbled in [inaudible [00:35:31] fashion and I'm like, ""Okay I guess that's what we're doing."" (pause) </p> So I don't know. I mean obviously we can just go out and do whatever we want. But...</p> It's still (pause) really sucky to deal with before. (pause)</p> Yeah. </p> (sniffling) </p> My mom has really vocally said that it upsets her. (pause) The idea of (pause) her parenting being criticized by my brother's psychiatrist or therapist or mine is extremely upsetting to her. Like that's one of the few times that she's really sort of expressed emotions that's even close to what she's having. (pause) </p> And the other thing, which (pause) my brother and I both encounter is—although he more so than I—(pause) kind of pathologizing [ph? [00:39:40] my parents interracial relationship...</p> ...for being the reason why my brother and I have [inaudible [00:39:45] problems. </p> Yeah. (pause) What is it, two psychiatrists sort of insist that's why you've got [inaudible [00:40:04]. (pause) Yeah. I mean one of them was at Dartmouth, and one of them was elsewhere. So, yeah. </p> No, I would have [ph? [00:40:21] stuck to you if you had. </p> Yeah. So and in both cases that we're talking about, my brother wasn't getting good care because the person was really focused on that. </p> Yes. Wait, actually no. I have a [inaudible [00:40:54] appointment on Monday</p> Morning maybe?</p> I can't remember if we talked about it or not. </p>",2
1003269453.txt,"Hi.</p> Yeah, I know, right. Sorry I'm late.</p> I was rushing around.</p> Nothing. I just - I had to go up…</p> No, today?</p> No, I didn't get it.</p> I don't know. I think that will - it would say on my phone but sometimes…</p> That's all right.</p> Sometimes if I'm on the phone - (inaudible at 0:00:51.7).</p> Okay yeah, because I don't have a message but - no, I said you don't have to call me back. We would talk about…</p> Yeah, I figured it would be fine.</p> No - yeah, I can imagine. No, I had to go to my sister's apartment - it's really my apartment.</p> No, the older. The LaSalle Street one we don't get - we don't move until the end of this month.</p> So it's in Northwest and I have been fixing my resume. Well one, for the Finn thing and two, because I have to start applying to jobs and like whatever.</p> Yeah, well I have a couple of issues as usual. It was something - okay. Well first I think this control issue of mine that needs to be really like addressed because for example today, I did not hear from Ferñao.</p> No, no, no like I've told you, even those times when I've gone crazy, like he's eventually called. So it's not an issue and it's not like a power struggle where like…</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> I wasn't. I mean he normally calls at the time that he called.</p> But I think it's just the fact that like everything is in his control. Like it's when he wants to call he calls.</p> And I can't stand it sometimes. It's not that I can't (inaudible at 0:03:33.9)…</p> …and sense it but like it's really frustrating. It's frustrating.</p> I mean.</p> I know, and it's really frustrating. And the thing is like then I start - oh, this is what I wanted to tell you. Then I start thinking like well - so he only calls me - he calls me when he wants.</p> …catastrophic thinking.</p> You know what I mean?</p> It's my lip gloss.</p> Yeah, it's like - it's not lip gloss it's like ChapStick - I don't know what to call it. Whatever, it smells good.</p> Yeah, it's strong. It's weird, yeah.</p> I think - I don't know if this is going too far, but I think like in the end I don't have any control.</p> Oh, what prompts it?</p> Yeah, that I have to wait.</p> Yeah. But I don't know if this like calling thing - I mean it's certainly an issue because I'm getting whatever about it.</p> Yeah.</p> Control.</p> Both. I mean…</p> …really.</p> Yeah, that I think more.</p> But only until like a certain point - at a certain point in the day. Like when it's like okay - like maybe I have something that I want to ask him, it's like okay, I can't call because.</p> I don't usually because I usually just whatever.</p> But I mean I've told him like…</p> Yeah and I…</p> Yeah but - yeah, maybe once or twice. But really 95 percent of the time he's called me or more than that.</p> Right.</p> Anger.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, yeah I should be able to talk to him when I want to talk to him at least once in a while.</p> Yeah. This is mainly the situation itself.</p> No, no because…</p> No it's not anger towards him.</p> If I felt for a second that he was like abusing this privilege - like I didn't really want to say privilege, whatever - I would be angry towards him. But he's not. [0:08:03.1]</p> Yeah, today especially.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. It's more just like I should be able to talk to him when I want, period, you know.</p> And then it's the catastrophic thinking after that.</p> Right.</p> I do know that.</p> I do.</p> No - well yeah. I think that's - well I don't know. I think so actually. I think that's part of the problem.</p> Right - yeah, exactly.</p> Exactly.</p> Exactly.</p> Yeah and I think…</p> And I think it's - yeah, it's definitely true. There's no doubt about it. And this experience especially like the trying to go back to Portugal and not being able to made it the clearest it's ever been.</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Yeah. Well it's - and yeah, it's definitely anxiety.</p> Yeah maybe.</p> It's just that I don't know - maybe I'm not recognizing it. I don't know how - I guess - yes I do get angry, I do get angry and I'd like to work on that. [0:10:01.2]</p> No, I don't think that. Not that it's not fair that I've been put in this relationship. I think it's not fair that the situation is the way that it is which…</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> No, because the reason why that's a thought is because of the catastrophic thinking. It's like they go like this. Because then I start thinking this situation is not fair because what could happen is blah-blah-blah-blah, you know.</p> Yeah.</p> I don't know. I don't know why I feel that way but I think it's - I'd like to blame it on a little expression we have in English that is, where there's a will there's a way.</p> So I…</p> Yeah, exactly, which I know is not true. I mean there are plenty of people that work their asses off at things and either don't get it or whatever.</p> What happened was that - well I started working with this one like group. And the woman that I was like directly under - well I wasn't good at the job.</p> Right, I mean…</p> No, that's true.</p> It's true in that situation, yeah.</p> Yes.</p> I'm sure I can think of other…</p> No.</p> I'm not even close.</p> If I…</p> Yeah, exactly. But if I don't care…</p> …I'm the worst worker in the world.</p> Right.</p> Right, or anything.</p> I don't know but I think in my brain what I start thinking is that the phone issue like us not being able to speak whenever we want whether it's him calling or me, is a stressor.</p> You know what I mean? And because of that it's not - I mean it's a little bit the control, but it's also just like even if he wanted to call anytime he wanted he couldn't, and it's like a stressor. [0:14:02.3]</p> No because number one he doesn't have Internet in his particular room in his house, like it's ridiculous.</p> Yeah. But anyway, when we do talk it's always about like the apartment, the visa, and it's like I don't know.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Because in my very dysfunctional brain I think that if we don't speak then that means because we have spoken every day since we've been separated that something will clear - it means something is clearly wrong.</p> Yeah, I do.</p> No, it's not stressing me out. I do want to talk every day. Like I - we don't have stressful conversations even though we are talking about annoying things.</p> Mm-hmm, yeah.</p> Yeah, sometimes.</p> The thing is though for me to tell him oh, could you send me a message to let me know when you're going to call?</p> I think it's kind of embarrassing. (LAUGHING)</p> Well the thing is what also pisses me off…</p> What?</p> Hopefully. No, I'm just kidding. [0:16:02.8]</p> But the other thing is that because I don't have a job right now and I have no focus, I feel like this whole thing is becoming my focus.</p> He's normally calling at like four o'clock, three o'clock, two o'clock our time which is like six, seven, eight or something like that there.</p> No, of course not.</p> No, I wouldn't pick up.</p> Yeah.</p> Usually - yeah, usually. Or whenever I have the time to call him back I'll call him.</p> Right, right.</p> Yeah, but that's like then I start thinking crazily again. Like I can't pick up the phone when he - if he can only call at this particular time because of his situation, and I can't answer at that particular time because of my situation, then when do we speak?</p> No.</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> No, I know.</p> No, it wouldn't.</p> But then I feel like if I'm lying…</p> Yeah, he knows.</p> No, I don't think so. He knows that I have these worrying problems but not about this in particular.</p> The thing is…</p> …like I would love to and I don't feel like I can't tell him things or whatever. But because we're not in the same country I feel like - I mean, I don't know. [0:18:55.6]</p> True, true, which is another problem.</p> Yeah.</p> Well actually I don't know if I like those. He - I don't know if it's an imperfection.</p> It's cute. It's kind of cute and kind of not be cute.</p> Right, but he's not perfect and I still like him even though he's not perfect. And there's a lot of like - for example…</p> No, I think he can but…</p> Yeah, definitely.</p> I don't know if I think of it as perfect, but it's like my best self…</p> …and in control of any negative things, yeah.</p> The things is well I don't know if it's that but if I do make a mistake and it's, you know, not something little and silly, then I'm so hard on myself that I think that even if other people don't care - don't whatever, I punish myself so much that maybe it makes me think that other people look at me that way, you know what I mean?</p> No - I mean I don't know it depends. [0:21:08.7]</p> Yeah, some of them. I mean not all of them but some of them, yeah.</p> I tell them and they probably could figure it out, you know.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Right, exactly.</p> I know.</p> Yeah.</p> He wasn't angry with me because of what happened. He was angry the reaction that I had when - after it happened.</p> Right.</p> Like hysterical like…</p> Not angry - he wasn't angry. He never actually got angry with me the entire time but he just felt like it was too extreme.</p> Yeah, I'm surprised that he wasn't even angry or - because I would have been livid.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I just…</p> No.</p> No, no, I'm sure he wouldn't.</p> Yeah. I can't and it will take me a while, you know.</p> Of course, I mean he knows I'm not perfect. I mean it's clear. And I don't…</p> Exactly, yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, it's just that I don't know how to like not try to be that way, you know what I mean.</p> I don't know, I never thought about that.</p> Yeah, I would die.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I couldn't do it.</p> I couldn't.</p> No, a stranger probably. No, I don't know. I don't know. I think that maybe Ferñao…</p> Yeah.</p> I don't know. I mean I've done that to - I mean I've done that too. I mean…</p> I don't know. I think it's just a comfort thing. [0:25:16.7]</p> Yeah, it could be.</p> Yeah, that's what I feel like really.</p> Because that's - I think it's because when I do even one little thing, I'm so hard on myself that and it's so extreme that in my head it seems like even bigger, you know what I mean.</p> It is not - it is not working at all.</p> No, of course.</p> No, I want to change it.</p> I want to change it. Like for example…</p> the thing is I - is I know I'm not perfect. I know it. But obviously I try to be as perfect as possible, you know what I mean, in front of people.</p> I mean…</p> …maybe they just don't care.</p> Yeah.</p> I don't know. I mean they just don't care. They don't…</p> Yeah, they…</p> Not doing stupid things that's funny and not a reflection of their whatever.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, well…</p> Yeah. But also, I mean, the things that Jackass people do are like that's voluntary. They're trying to look stupid and be funny or whatever.</p> But having an anxiety issue that's not like a one day thing, is different, you know.</p> Yeah.</p> I think that's the problem.</p> Yeah.</p> Right.</p> Or I have to.</p> Yeah, yeah, yeah - I see.</p> No.</p> Or failure, yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Right, yeah.</p> Yeah, I think that's better. Yeah, it's better.</p> right.</p> Right.</p> Yeah, right. Yeah, I know it's definitely more realistic.</p> If I change it to a preference?</p> Yeah, I mean no anxiety. Almost no anxiety.</p> Yeah, concern but I mean not anxiety where it's like…</p> If I couldn't - maybe like disappointed.</p> Yeah, disappointed.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> I know.</p> No.</p> Yeah, it's unrealistic.</p> No, it's not.</p> No, I mean it might, yeah. No, it's true. It's annoying that I know all of these things but yet I can't - you know, not that I can't but I haven't been able to. [0:31:09.5]</p> Right.</p> Yeah - yeah.</p> I don't know, I mean I think - I feel like I have like okay - for example this is really 0 you're going tor really think I'm crazy after this. But - so obviously I can speak Portuguese because I've lived in Lisbon.</p> To - sorry?</p> (inaudible at 0:32:10.8) keeps going. We speak English because I was - he was my student, that's how we met or whatever, so yeah.</p> What?</p> No.</p> No (LAUGHING). But you know what I mean, this is similar to what we were saying about just going what to someone on the street and saying, I'm Laura, I'm neurotic.</p> Yeah, exactly.</p> Yeah, I know.</p> Yeah, that's obvious.</p> But it's also…</p> My Portuguese is crappy because I was always so nervous about practicing that I - I mean I know a time, I can understand whatever. I can speak but it's very difficult because I haven't practiced.</p> Yeah, I don't know.</p> It would be the end of the world I think.</p> No, not at all. In fact if I spoke any Spanish to Ferñao he would probably be the happiest person.</p> Yeah, probably - probably.</p> I couldn't. I couldn't. I won't be able to.</p> I don't know. I don't know. It's - if I could - if we could accomplish one thing like in the next few months or whatever…</p> …it would be to - for me to get over it.</p> For some reason I would prefer you to think of me as shitty because I won't do it than for me to actually do it; I don't know why.</p> It's not. It's really not good at all.</p> yeah, I do.</p> No, it's hard - it's hard.</p> No, I think I would die of embarrassment a little bit inside.</p> Yeah, I'd get over it.</p> I guess.</p> His opinion if it sucks as the worse Portuguese anyone has ever spoken, he will still be so much happier that I tried.</p> Yes, I do - I do.</p> I don't know. It's just so hard, this particular thing especially. I don't know.</p> Right.</p> Yeah, I know.</p> I know. I know that the speaking Portuguese issue if I could work on that…</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Yeah, I do.</p> I know. I know.</p> I know.</p> I know. But then I start thinking like well, I've wasted so much time being worried about it and I could be so much better than I am that now I'm even worse than - you know what I mean?</p> Like it's just (inaudible at 0:36:54.8).</p> Yeah.</p> Really? [0:37:21.6]</p> Oh, okay, so then the next week. So Thursday, right?</p> Thursday at seven, okay.</p> Okay.</p> I don't know. I just - I wish there was a magic answer.</p> No.</p> Right.</p> Right.</p> No, I wouldn't think you were stupid.</p> Right, exactly, that's it.</p> No - I'm kidding yeah. Yeah, of course.</p> No, no, but I know what you mean. No, it's true I wouldn't think you were stupid, I would just, you know.</p> Yeah…</p> …in certain ways.</p> Yeah.</p> Much easier to talk I think. Because a message I would think it…</p> That's the thing. I think if I look at it like that like one minute, you know, or two minutes or whatever.</p> Yeah, exactly - exactly. It seems more bearable. And I think once I get over just a shorter - short time, I could maybe.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> I know.</p> I know. And the thing is like he speaks English far better than my Portuguese but he makes mistakes.</p> And it's not like I ever - I just think I'm so much of a better person than some other people. (LAUGHING).</p> I know.</p> I'm going to try really heard. I can't make any promises but I really am going to try.</p> One or two minutes even. Or one - if I could do one sentence - like a full sentence.</p> Yeah, all right.</p> All right, so the following week Thursday right?</p> All right. I'm so nervous about my homework.</p> Oh yeah, I can do that.</p> Oh really?</p> Oh my god. So just this, right? Just me fill in the bubbles? Oh god, it is long.</p> All right, I'll see if I have enough time.</p> Yeah. I jut have to get back to my sister's apartment before 6:30 because I stole her boots. And if she finds out…</p> Yes, they're real nice. They're so comfortable.</p> This is the way out, right.</p> All right, thank you.</p> Bye.</p>",2
1000013415.txt,"It is hard.</p> It is hard - it is uncomfortable.</p> The thing about hiring someone - the equipment, Beth's teachers from (inaudible 0:26). There was no artist and she has the same problem as an artist, having to make herself, come out with a system to make goals - I am kind of loosely following it through Beth - and it works. But no one...the thing is I don't really need her for that. No one can make me do the goal. I can have the plan but if I don't follow it, what is the difference? Only me can make me sit down and do the work.</p> Right.</p> I hope I just keep remembering that. If I get to this (inaudible 1:16) report. Once I sit down and write, that it is good.</p> I will give you the check and then we will see about next week.</p> Why I cannot get the project to work.</p> Yeah, so what have I to do?</p> Okay. I will claim it.</p> Do I get release papers.</p> It says you can cancel at any time.</p> How are you?</p> Because I was here last Tuesday. You guys are swamped.</p> I don't want to be here today.</p> Too busy. I am running here, I am running there - I am running all over the place.</p> (Inaudible 3:06) and riding all the way back down. But then I was here.</p> It has nothing to do with you. What I am saying about that, I am thinking: ""Well, alright, I don't have anything to talk about."" And she will say: ""Well, what is that about (laughs)?""</p> Yeah. Nothing is really bothering me right now - I feel really good. I don't know.</p> Yeah, you told me you don't.</p> You said your job was to dig up things. Is that a new clock?</p> You said your job was to dig up things. I don't care - well maybe there are some bad things in my good thing.</p> You did. You said it was your job to dig up things - not bad things but things that were maybe bothering me or maybe they are hidden. Maybe I misinterpreted it then.</p> I don't know. You just seem like you never wanted to.</p> That is my interpretation. What is that smirk for?</p> Well, first I did part of my show down at Double Door - the show that I am working on, which is good. (inaudible 4:43) they are giving me 10 minutes. They are giving me (inaudible 4:47) as a standup comic and there are funny magicians and they do sketch comedy. That is kind of scary in itself. I mean, I will do it but it is just scary - really putting myself out on a limb. Will I be good? And thinking: ""I don't know if that is funny - does it have to be funny? Will people understand what it is?"" Because they are coming to see these sketch comedy artists and my act is definitely not sketch comedy. It is pretty much what I would call performance art.</p> It is good - it is a risk. I got an audition for an interview with a commercial agent - just now I got off the phone - it was really nice. It is really funny. When I get up every day and I say: ""Something terrific is going to happen today."" And it does. And yesterday I was coming home and I said: ""God, I (inaudible 5:51) today. Well I guess something new terrific happened; I got paid, I cashed my check. That is pretty good."" </p> It is chance. Well, it is not chance. I have been working real hard and putting it out there. Still, when I think of Phil and I think of me in the show, I would be backstage talking about that actor and that actor. Because of my own insecurities. Phil is just nice and fun, people are attracted to him. They are attracted to me but not in the same way.</p> Not joking. I am talking more about like this is our...it is different when you are doing it in a critical way in a sense that you can talk about another actor because you are going to learn about it, discuss it. That is fine but not because where it would come out of me during that particular show because I was unhappy.</p> Oh yeah. That is...I have to learn to keep my mouth shut - about that stuff.</p> Because I don't feel good about it. I don't want to be a light actor like that - that gossips, talks bad of people. I feel like I am a criminal committing a crime of the tongue. </p> No, I just don't feel healthy about it. I feel, like, poisonous when I do it. I remember coming into work the other day, I was so furious with my boss. A (inaudible 8:09) who is getting paid to work 40 hours is maybe working 20 while I covered his ass all the time. I came in really angry Friday, all pissed off and bitching and everybody. I went home and thought: ""I hate feeling this way. I either want to change it or do something about it.""</p> Yeah, hoping that something will come out of it.</p> I don't know.</p> Yeah, I guess I feel I don't deserve it.</p> I don't know...be happy. Feel like I am deserving for God and the universe to give me things...because I complain too much.</p> Yeah, too cynical. I mean, you were talking (inaudible 9:41) to help me get this...I figured I would really pick people's brains. I got this guy a job at Union Bank & Trust and he - I have known him and his girlfriend; actors for a long time. He works in commercials in television. So I just said: ""Well, I just went to your agent. (Inaudible 10:00) been happily, married away."" And I was thinking: ""What am I going to do when I get in there asides just be myself even though I can't be anything else? People can't really see me in two minutes. Like if they came to work with me, they would see me. I can't go into an office and sit and talk to somebody - I hate it. I don't know how to be myself in an office situation like that.</p> Because that is the feeling: ""I am not good enough. I am not talented enough. I am not personable enough."" I don't know how to be myself so I figured: ""Well, if I can't be myself I don't really deserve this agent anyway.</p> Do you not understand that?</p> You know, like. If I am not going to get this job - this agent is not going to send me out and sign me - then it really isn't that good a news anyway. It is not good fortune to fall upon if I am not going to get it anyway.</p> Because I am not good enough. I feel maybe I am not comfortable in his or her office because I don't feel good enough.</p> Do you not see how the two coincide?</p> Let me know what you don't understand. (11:58)</p> I really don't know how to help.</p> No, I just have really long opinions about six o'clock every day.</p> No, no. I do want to talk about it. I feel that this is something I don't like - putting myself down. I really don't have anything to justify it with. Why should I feel like I am not good enough? It is like I am talking to this actor and I am putting him on a pedestal Because he has always been in commercials and films. I am talking to him and this guy is 40 years old and he is this scared and insecure little boy. And vulnerable. He is just like everybody else.</p> I don't feel that way today actually. Talking about the good stuff, for some reason, is stuff that bothers me about me. </p> To dig up.</p> Yeah, not to annoy me but it is your job.</p> I am not trying to prevent you at all.</p> I am not. I am saying: ""Look, here is how I think I am f***** up because I don't think I am good enough for this stuff that is befalling me which is great stuff that I really intellectually know I deserve but since I am thinking: ""Oh my God, I am not good enough. I am personable enough. I am not a good enough person."" And I should be able to get this agent.</p> No, dig away.</p> No, I do.</p> (Chuckles.) Why is that?</p> I mean, is that a bad thing?</p> I am not being open.</p> I am. Why do you feel that way?</p> I don't know. I feel open. Maybe I not looking or responding open but I do. I really don't know what you want me to say. I didn't feel like...I didn't want to come in...but I don't feel I have consciously tried to avoid you.</p> I guess Because I have to take time to sit down and the other way I keep moving. Not that I consciously think: 'Oh boy, if I go there I am really going to have to face my problems."" I don't consciously think that. I just think: ""I keep moving - I like being that busy."" So I am busy that I don't have the time to sit down and think why my life is this way or that way. Besides, I like it the way it is. I am doing all that I can for it. I don't want to keep questioning it but if I have idle time, I will start pushing that. Like the same thing as I said before: I don't want to work with catering and waiting anymore but at the same time it gives me something to be at every day - the other way is harder. I get the same way now. (18:11)</p> A weight - my responsibility to you.</p> How do you feel about that?</p> Does that make you feel responsible or...am I the bad guy?</p> I guess that before I thought about: ""Well, why would I come in today?"" But if I say, ""well, I have don't have anything to talk about,"" what would you say?""</p> Again, I think I do. I am not consciously saying that: ""Oh, I don't want to talk about things that hurt.""</p> I am not faking that I don't want to go there but maybe I don't. I really don't know.</p> Now stop asking me (chuckles).</p> Whether or should go there or not. I just really don't know.</p> And then maybe I can tell you about all the good things that will then come around to that other thing. Okay?</p> My friend Missy - we went out to dinner - who comes here. Her husband who comes here.</p> (Inaudible 20:53) Missy says: ""You are starting to sound like, you guys, your therapy is the right therapy and right medication because all I do is cry the entire time."" And I said: ""But my therapist would love that I cry (chuckles)."" And I said to Martin: 'Did you ever cry at those?"" And he said: ""No way."" And then Missy said: ""Oh, from the time I walk in to the time I walk out, I cry."" So I said: ""Well, you are going to have to go and see Rosemary."" The other good thing was...</p> That was just fun - that was good. (21:28)</p> Yeah, that is in good fun.</p> Okay, Go ahead.</p> No, I am teasing.</p> No, I am aware of my avoidance.</p> Yeah, definitely. That you want me to go there - to experience my feelings which I think is good. I like that.</p> A little bit. As humorous as the image of me running around in a tutu and a little bell around (inaudible 22:16) and you locking the door behind you: it is funny but do I really want to do it here?</p> I have got a little baby picture. (inaudible 22:31) I mean I do - I do like that.</p> No, it is not the way that you go about it. It is my responsibility...I am feeling a heavy responsibility when I come in here - like I said last week - to perform. Not perform - deliver; come up with the goods. And that is pressure to me. I didn't say that you did it - I think I did say that but I don't mean it - I feel that is what I am supposed to do. I am trying to get a (inaudible 23:34) ""I really like her; the way you work."" I mean we were talking at the table and I said: ""I really like it. I am finally learning how this therapy is working."" That is for good for me, as opposed to somebody telling me: ""Don't you think if it made sense if you did all my (inaudible 23:59) It is a combination of what you do as well. (Inaudible 24:13) So I met with my family. (24:17) </p> We had a great time. I decided we had to have a minion even though it only refers to deaths.</p> A minion is 10 people. Like when somebody dies...I know when my father died you had to have at least 10 men - 10 people - there to say a service. So It was my cousin's 20th party at this restaurant but it was really, really good. My mother is trying very hard. I told you I spoke to her. She made confessions and I made confessions. Actually, it was the first time I was proud of my family - proud to be part of my family. It was nice. We will see what happens. I still want to be real guarded. I don't know if I saw you since last time I drove the train. I think I am cured. I can say thus far, I have been cured. We took the local down to the Eternal Flame and half the stop was in this complete u-turn which I was not even aware of and we were just stopped on the way back. So it kept stopping - two or three times - and it was like: ""What is your level? What is your level?"" ""I'm disappointed - it is only a four tops."" ""That is all?""</p> The whole week I keep it charted in 15 segments. And I said: ""I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am probably going to have to cut you loose pretty soon. You are going to have to get your 50 bucks from somebody else. They said: ""No, that is the best compliment that I can get."" I just need to do it on my own without him now. Even if he is in another car, I am pretty sure that I can. I mean, I know I can. And he said: ""Well, that is really surprising."" And I said: ""If I can sit on a train for a half hour from 79th Street to 101st, there is no reason why I can't sit on this train."" I am so proud of myself because in the past I always thought I didn't have discipline. I didn't start, I didn't finish. And here is something that I had a problem with, I sought out help, I did the homework, I had the desire and I fixed it. I am just really, really proud of that. I said: ""You see Ted, you can talk yourself out of that. This was chance, this was luck - this was hard work.</p> And courage. And it has taught me so much - as I said before - it has taught me so many other things. To think about not wanting to go and do that show; I know I can do it because if I can do the train I can do anything. That is my Vietnam; that is my gun in the mouth.</p> Thank you. And I tell people that...well, they don't quite understand because they don't understand the fear - of having fear. (inaudible 27:22) When I go on the subway, I am always looking at something - the shoes. Same thing as an elevator but without that panic, you wouldn't understand.</p> Yeah, it is good. I mean, I still have apprehension. And he said: ""You will have that for a long time because you taught yourself to be apprehensive - that makes sense."" Because I just want to feel like I don't think about it but he said: ""Yeah, that takes time. And as long as you go and you can deal with it, that is the thing."" I have found it easier being stalled in a tunnel than I did sitting on a train for a half hour because it was so long - I just wanted to get off of it. Because it is such hard work. so this time I really just want to go and not take levels - just sit there and soak up the ride or do what I do. He said I can always call on him. I just want to be able to share that with other people. I mean a lot of (inaudible 28:30) although I wouldn't pretend to be one but I just wish I could help other people deal with those fears. I have a good friend, as I said, that cannot get on an elevator but she won't even take his number down.</p> No. I wish I could be helpful but she had never come against a panic attack because she is never getting on an elevator. I think once or twice a month she has to take an elevator. I think she waits and waits and waits until it is perfectly clear and holds her breath. The last time she had to get in one of those coffin elevators in a beauty parlor - a salon - and she went up there and stayed there for two hours. She wouldn't come down. Finally, the maintenance man had to get in there with her like this. I know how scary those lifts can get for her.</p> Desire and also I knew that I could learn to teach myself to think differently. And that is what it was for me - to stop thinking about it. The one thing he said to me that would help me more than anything was not the stalled train - it was my interpretation of the stalled train. That was on my way to (inaudible 29:54) That physical reaction comes from something that can happen. If someone came, like Colin Ferguson with a machine gun, I would have back up - I would have something to deal with the situation. I would have him to deal with - I could attack that situation. This is something you can't touch - it is just fear. And that is the worst thing. I really believe God brought me here so I could have panic attacks, so I could face it, so I could improve other parts of my life. I was trying to write a mission statement the other day - my mission statement - and I couldn't quite come up with it. I couldn't come up with an entertainer, which is not good enough. I don't think God put me here to be Al Jolson. I was trying to think about really why I was put here - what my mission is and how it is to help people through...what? I don't know. Entertaining somebody sounds too circus. And it is really difficult. I can't define what it is yet.</p> I know it is to help make people feel good about themselves. I didn't know how to do that in (inaudible 31:15) but I don't know...through my energy; through my passion; through humor - I think that is what it was - through my salesperson skills. I always loved Les Brown, that African-American motivational speaker. He has been on TV lots of times - always wanted his job; he does a great job. He travels the country and makes people feel good about themselves. Everybody learned. He grew up with his grandmother or something from rags to riches. I always really liked that and I hope that one day people will come to me and say: ""How did you do that?"" Makes me feel good to make them feel good.</p> No one would believe it unless I had it. I don't know how to get involved in it or should I just call the ADDA - who I am involved with and am a member of - and talk to them and see. They have groups with many people who are success stories. I mean, I can't imagine being agoraphobic but Cory has (inaudible 32:52) This woman is just learning to get out of the house. I know where it comes from but I can't imagine somebody ever doing that. (33:03)</p> I get sick when I relax. I need a vacation for my vacation. It is hard for me to just go. This was actually a very good week though. Having seen (inaudible 33:39) was enough. I am not single. My daughter. When am I ever going to get the house and the car? When am I ever going to stop worrying about money? Stupid stuff - I am doing all I can. Sixteen hours a day, whatever it takes to get up at 5.30 to go the gym; come home and work on the voice work; send out resumes - I am doing all night (inaudible 34:04). And realizing that, yes, my day job takes up more hours but I don't have the time or the energy to put the equal amount into it every day.</p> Most people look so sad. It almost hurts. I don't know what bothers me. It is hurting that it is: ""Okay, I am giving up. I am giving over to this job thing."" Or that it is I am putting more time into this. Maybe I am holding onto the job for a reason, I don't know. I don't know how you do that. Did you clean yourself out or are you just accepting or am I just saying: ""Okay, I am going with the flow. Get in the boat; I am going where the seabird goes.""</p> I don't know how to distinguish the difference between trying to...I don't know how to put this whether I am trying, but I am going to come up with a really good way and you are going to help me. I don't know how to decipher the difference between br-br-br-br-breakfast - the American Express way. You want it? You buy it. You go wherever you want - this frenzy. I will just go wherever the tide takes me. I have control and I have the orders and I can do what I want as long as I am not (inaudible 35:18) my will but I am not going to speed the whole way - I am going to float down.</p> Between breaking and putting on the gas pedal.</p> I think so.</p> Yes, and it is also:"" Have I been doing enough?"" Being, for me, is harder than just doing.</p> I am trying to just ""be."" (36:03)</p> But I am ""doing?""</p> I was just thinking now (inaudible 36:50) ""This is good, settle down. This is just so great that I could figure this and I left work and I am not going back.""</p> I am. It has just hit me. I was like: ""This is all good. This is very stimulating."" I wasn't taking time out. I didn't want to - I wanted to do this. It is good for me.</p> Which is?</p> I don't know what you mean by that.</p> And?</p> Yes, I agree with that.</p> Into soaking up the space.</p> I guess because part of me would think...I know intellectually I want to have the space but the other thing...""Well, those are good things but I wanted to talk about what is bothering you."" Even though that needs space too. I don't know what I am talking about.</p> I don't know (chuckles). I thought I had a point - I just lost it. It is true: just like in here and outside once I just sit down and breath and be an adult, I am pretty terrific. Oftentimes - and more and more - I like myself. I do - I realize that I am pretty swell. I believe in myself. I told you about my (inaudible 39:10) allergy, didn't I? (39:12)</p> Say that again.</p> Yeah.</p> Well, I don't know - it was dragging at straws or throwing air or what.</p> Well, I am definitely...what is that?</p> I am definitely influenced by you or other people. I am trying not to be. In the sense of how you feel. If you are feeling shitty that doesn't mean I have to feel shitty.</p> No, there is not an awareness.</p> No, I didn't say that. I meant I am trying not to be influenced. I am influenced by other people. I am learning in here that if that doesn't sound right to me, then that is wrong. Let us not go that way. You are going the wrong way from there. But I also know that, yeah, I am influenced, you even said it to me - you reacting this way to me because you think I should go that way.</p> Well it takes me half of the sessions to get there or whatever. It seems to me that the latter part of our sessions is more truthful.</p> Because it feels like we are going through quicksand at the beginning.</p> Right now I feel good - stimulated. It is like we are both not interested in driving. Did you notice? (42:00)</p> Do you really?</p> In what sense? What all is going on in here - me?</p> I would imagine talking to me, it is probably hard to make sense a lot of times. I switch around; I do things like mental acrobatics. What happens a lot - I will tell you exactly what happens a lot to me; just to me - what happens for me is that you will throw the ball at me and I am trying to figure out exactly how I feel - I am. I am not quite sure sometimes. It is not like I am trying to give you the answer you want, I am trying to really concentrate and think because I will say to myself: ""Am I really covering up how I feel?"" Because I know I do that.</p> Right now I am.</p> It is contagious!</p> (Shouts) ""Welcome aboard! She is coming.""</p> Welcome to my world (chuckles)! Well, I know because a lot of it Rosemary is...my head is fascinating everyone. It is this brain. Am I saying that because that is the way I feel? Am I saying it Because I want you to feel good? Am I saying it Because someone else is saying it? Am I saying it because I am trying too hard? I mean, I know at times in work - I have to play games at work - because it is my job and I know when I am doing it there, well I am kissing somebody's ass. I have to do it sometimes - pretend that I like people sometimes when I can't stand them. That is much more cut and dry for me. </p> What is up?</p> Oh, it must be painful (chuckles).</p> No, no.</p> Oh golly, what did I do?</p> ""Yeah, well I wasn't quite sure if it was a great impression darling (ph)."" I don't know - all this school work and I haven't learned a damn thing (chuckles).</p> I don't know.</p> I have to.</p> In the beginning I find myself very calm. I will just sit here and you are looking at me and you are going: ""Start."" That is the sense I get from you. ""Go - the light is green."" And I don't know where I want to go. What do you say to that? How do you feel about it?</p> What I just said about.</p> If I said that, so Rosemary, you would say?</p> Well, if you sit in a driveway you are facing the same way so you are not directly looking at someone.</p> That is not true.</p> That is not how I deal with it.</p> It doesn't seem to be as difficult for you as it is for me. You seem very comfortable.</p> I feel the same way at auditions. Even though someone may be hoping that I am going to be the next John Travolta or whoever walks through the door, I still feel this gigantic magnifying glass being held up. And I know that it is my interpretation of the situation. I want to see what I can do. I want to see who I am.</p> They are sussing me - it is a fact. And it is my interpretation of what that sussing means. I guess what they are saying, well they hope I am really good but that puts a lot of pressure. I don't know what they consider really good.</p> Does that mean I should try to evoke or...see what I am saying?</p> It does because I can't be me when I have got that pressure on my head. You know: ""Go be you."" I cannot do that. Only when I feel relaxed and in control.</p> And I haven't figured out how to deal with that situation.</p> I feel I don't need this. Well, I am uncomfortable. My friends, my family, my work. How do I learn to do that - just be, I don't know, what is your suggestion?</p> Cory.</p> Thanks.</p> I think so. You know, I think I have a job that night. (50:24)</p>",1

[Silence from [00:15:28] to 00:15:41]</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm (barely audible).</p> Hmm (ph — barely audible/pause) okay (ph).

[00:25:03]</p> . . . um, yeah, and not to put too fine a point on it and, (audible sigh/pause) I don't know.

1000016551.txt,"Well, I was making a fondue dinner last Saturday, and it's weird...</p> I fondued the thumb and these two and my wrist, so I really...</p> Weird, you know. That's one of the things I have to talk about. This is really another kind of a hectic week. I don't know, like I couldn't comprehend it, you know. I really couldn't figure it out. It was like for five seconds I can't account for, you know. </p> Well, the one that had been on the stove.</p> Right, right. She says it was sitting there very neatly. But when I turned - I think I turned to go into the living room, and she was right beside me, and I don't know if the grease spattered or what. All I knew is I had been nervous that day and, like, my right hand was real shaky. And it was all of a sudden, like I knew I was going to spill it.</p> Oh, yeah. I was holding the fondue pot with this hand. What I can't remember is I still had both pots, like if I was trying to decide whether to pour more of it into it. And as I turned, Anne was standing right beside me, and I don't know if I knew I was going to spill it or not, but all of a sudden she darted away from me, because I think she sensed I was going to spill it. You know, it was just - it's as hot as it can get. And then I must have panicked and thought I was going to spill it, too, but then it was like I went up like this is the only way I can reconstruct it. 0:04:45.1</p> The stuff came shooting out and it went all over my hand, and my first reaction was just complete calm. All I did, I dropped the pan and I jumped back, and the first thing I did, I just opened the refrigerator and stuck my hand in the ice tray, you know. And I looked at it and I said - I knew it was bad. And I stuck my hand in there, and then my first reaction was, ""Well, I can't go on the ski trip,"" and then I thought, I says, ""I don't think I did that on..."" I said, ""I think I did that on purpose,"" you know. There was something about it. It was like I knew it was going to happen and I stuck my hand in the refrigerator. And I had this funny feeling, like, did I drop it on myself? Because I had been kind of nervous. And then I said, ""Did I drop it on myself because I was afraid I was going to drop it on Anne, or did I really want to throw it at her or something like this? You know, it was weird, it was just weird. </p> Yeah, yeah, because I knew, I knew when I handled - I'd handled grease, you know. It's not like I'm a dummy around the kitchen. I've handled grease. You know, it's not like I'm a dummy around the kitchen. On Vicarage (sp?) I had French fries twice a day for 365 days. I know what I'm doing with grease. 0:06:13.0</p> Yeah. Well, you know, this thing about like last week. Well, I mentioned, when like I stuck my hand in there and then my first thought was, you know, I says, you know, ""I think I did that on purpose."" Then both the girls that were over there, they just - they were trying to reassure me that it wouldn't be so bad and all this, which was just irritating to me.</p> Yeah. Oh, I knew - well, the first thing we did, right, I went to the hospital and they treated it and they said that - the last time I was there - I can't go on the ski trip. I was just going to go to ride along, but no, they say that it's a huge blister here and they're going to open it on Saturday and then if it doesn't heal then we've got to do skin graft on it.</p> I couldn't shake this feeling, you know, that I had done it on purpose.</p> I don't know. That's why when - I think it had something to do - well, like last week when I was talking it got to the point where - I was talking about why the kids were always chasing me at home, and I answered that I had a big mouth, that this was why, and how that's one thing, but I don't know how to explain like on Saturday. Friday night I was with a different girl again, and when I came back I don't think I really wanted to be with Anne. 0:08:38.4</p> Yeah. And I had - it was like a kind of a guilty feeling. </p> No, I didn't want to be with her either. I didn't really want to be with either one. But it was like when Anne came I was nervous and she was like, you know, just helping, you know, getting stuff ready, and she bought a bunch of stuff, but I couldn't shake this feeling, I mean, you know, being - uneasiness or guilt or something.</p> Yeah. I was too uptight to enjoy myself really and I had feelings like - just like negative, negative kind of thoughts, and there was no reason for it, there's no real reason for it. And the only thing I can think of with the grease thing is that it maybe momentarily flashed in my brain to drop it on her and maybe...</p> Yeah, it was like maybe this is what I wanted to do, but I can't admit that to myself, that I even had that thought. And then it was right after - if that happened, then boom, you know, it came splashing down on me, you know, as though it's almost like to pay for that if I thought that...</p> I don't know if I'm just (cross talk).</p> Yeah. I don't know if I'm concocting things or... It's like I almost have to conclude - and I'm trying to think if I conclude this. I talked to one of my friends at the bar and she said - you know, she said, ""You really hate yourself,"" and that's what I thought too, you know, I had thought this before, but it scared the hell out of me that I hated myself to the point of really messing myself up good. I don't think I wanted to mess myself up that bad, if I did. That scared me, because that's the first time. You know, I went back and I was trying to - it was about 3:00, 4:00, when I got to sleep, was into bed. 0:12:01.1 </p> Yeah, or they didn't understand that I - they dismissed the idea as ridiculous almost, that it could have been on purpose, because I couldn't shake it then after that. You know, I'd keep saying, ""I wonder if - what unconsciously I was trying to do there."" But they just - that's not the way people think. You know, you don't do things like that intentionally; it's an accident.</p> He didn't say too much. Mitch is the kind of guy that will listen and not say too much about something most of the time, and then I didn't press it after that. I figured, you know - because I was so confused about it. But you know, what it wound up doing was really scaring me, and like I thought, well, if that's so, you know, what is to keep me like from making an idiot move in the car? It was like I wound up distrusting myself almost in regard to two different people. I know this like last...</p> Yes, well, I can't separ - I can't figure it out. Maybe I really am. Maybe that's why, you know, I reacted so strongly. Because there was absolutely - you know, I did not get bumped. It was spattering a little.</p> Yes, underneath, you know, it's like underneath.</p> Yeah, no, because...</p> Yeah, I don't want to admit that, because I wound up burning myself, and to admit that I did have potential to do that... And actually, some of the grease things, when they hit the floor, might have splattered on her leg so there could have been... But then why would I want to do that?</p> Because I was irritated with her all night.</p> I thought it was against her, but then I said it doesn't make sense, though. She's not - you know, she is in every way not being an ass, not making an ass out of herself. 0:16:21.5</p> No, it didn't. </p> Yeah, right. To me, logically, there was no reason to be irritated with her. And the only reason it struck me as so weird, I guess, was because I had somehow - somehow I had a guilty feeling, because I was with somebody else last night and then here I was with her. It was almost like I had a - it was like a social convention, I needed a date, and I had asked her out for the previous Wednesday when Mitch and his wife could not make it, and then we had delayed once more, and then finally we could all get together and that didn't...</p> That's a good question, right? I said it was a social  - </p> Convention.</p> The way it came about was that I had asked her over for a fondue dinner. Then I remember, ah-ha, I talked to Mitch and Kim about coming over; I'll combine it. So we combined it with a movie on a Wednesday. But their little baby got sick, so we postponed it until Saturday, so it was actually like a hanging-over thing. But I do have a feeling, like when I go with them I always have a date. 0:18:47.7</p> And always a different one. I don't think I've ever - oh, no, yeah, two years ago I did; I was dating a girl solidly back then. That's the only time you've ever seen me with a girl I think more than one (inaudible at 0:19:07.4). So I don't feel...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, yeah. Maybe it's like some kind of - fulfilling like an image they have of me; you know, a new girl every time. Kim always chuckled about it.</p> Yeah, almost that way.</p> Usually when I'm with a date, you know, with them, I'm sure the date must get the idea that she's just an appendage, a real (inaudible at 0:20:16.2), because most of the time I'm paying attention to either Kim or Mitch and talking to them. And I'll try to include her once in a while, but most of my experiences are common to those two, and the girl has to feel outside. 0:20:30.0</p> Some of the time because I was dating a girl, like when we went to a social - </p> No, no, Saturday night was a different thing; it came by coincidence.</p> Yeah, but then we postponed until Saturday, and since I had asked Anne I said, ""Okay, we'll make it Saturday."" It's not really like I - I sometimes ask out girls like it's either just to be with somebody... It's like I don't have that much interest in them and then I feel bad about that. I found with Anne last night - and I'm sure I indicated something to her that I wouldn't be seeing her again for a while, too. I mean she picked that up, and actually last time we had a fairly decent time. </p> And I didn't (inaudible at 0:22:23.6) to me. Now, that wasn't then. That was even embarrassing. I get embarrassed just thinking about it. It's like a girl's got a fifth on how I assess a girl. She's got to be perfect in every category.</p> It's the same thing I do, you know, with - well, like I really explained last week, with most people, you know, I assess them.</p> No, men, too. I assess you, you know.</p> Yeah, I think that's so. Because with women, unless I can find some area of weakness, something that bugs them more than - they're not strong in, I start feeling uncomfortable and I usually will give up rather quickly if I detect that immediately, bingo, and then detect no areas of whether uncertain or, you know... 0:24:29.0</p> Yeah, maybe because I'm so much afraid of being weaker. Yeah, I have that. It's like always a contest, you know. I guess I never thought of that.</p> Well, how do I win when the girl is stronger? If I perceive her as stronger, she wins.</p> Okay, Sylvio, yeah, but Sylvio...</p> Now, that comes close, because... That thing you said, I never lose though...</p> Well, I've done that a hell of a lot. I've only truly felt like I've lost once, and that was with Jackie, because the only time anybody ever told me face to face without a whole lot of pressure from other sources, you know, that she didn't want to date me anymore. That, you know, just about annihilated me. That was really hard.</p> No, no, no. Just...</p> Yeah, well, I excused that because (inaudible at 0:28:11.3) but I didn't...</p> Yes, she was, one other guy, who she was infatuated with, but you know, she was dating other people, too. You know, I must be getting close to something, because I'm trying to keep it away and then, you know - I can't fit it together because if - if the woman is strong, it's almost like I react like a little boy, almost across the board, but if she's weak I do the same thing, too; I react like a little boy both ways... 0:30:11.7 </p> Because, just, you know, he before - you know, we'd get together on social occasions, like maybe once every two weeks. But now, like, sometimes he'll call up and say ""Would you like to go out, you know, to eat,"" or something like that. Or I've got friends down from Hyde Park, you know, and usually if I'm reading or something I almost would rather read; it's like I don't want to be bothered.</p> Oh, I can. Sometimes I do. Most people I can tell them. I've got this other guy I met at a bar - well, this is Jay - and he'll call a lot. But you know, a lot of times I just don't want to be bothered and I'll just, you know, think of either an excuse or I'll say I can't tonight or something like that. You know, it's like almost impossible for me to accept, you know, like feelings that somebody cared. Just, you know, it doesn't make sense, because on the one hand I ask people all the time for what shall I do and all this sort of thing, I don't want it to do that. And on the other hand, you know, it's really hard for me to believe even that anybody really cares. And I don't know, maybe it's myself, too, that... You know, I can say with my mind, like I really think I don't feel very good about myself or I even hate myself; I can say that with my mind. </p> What?</p> Yeah, without always having to...</p> Yeah, belittle or like in anything that I did it was always - you know, when I really did something well, I've done a few things well, and when I did, the smaller I was the more I just couldn't accept it. I'd just say, well, you know, or else I'd get embarrassed. I just couldn't say ""Thank you."" I could never say ""thank you."" </p> Yeah. It was a fluke. It was a fluke. I can't really do that; it was a fluke. And I don't know why it is I can't - like what I'm trying to do is remember. Maybe that's not the way you do it. I can see it now in waves; I don't know that I can feel it that much. I have a - like one of the things I think I fear about therapy is feeling something. I don't want anybody seeing me feel anything.</p> I have to recognize, you know, that's one of the things.</p> Well, I know myself like, I guess, feel I equate with tears, you know. I don't want anybody to see me cry. I cry, I cry maybe twice a year, but I only cry alone.</p> (Inaudible at 0:37:50.9)</p> No. I haven't marked those down on my calendar. But you know, when I cry I've got these weird things. There is a record by Joan Baez, and it's one of these - what are some of them? The green, green fields of home. You know, it's about a guy that's in a - about a guy in a prison, and he comes home, and I always think about going back to my home town and it always makes me sad and I sometimes cry. And in the last five years I cry about - maybe even before a lot. </p> I don't know if it's that so much, or maybe it is, but it seems to me like - almost like since I'm no good anyway... I guess that's all it seems like; since I'm no good anyway. I remembered another thing. When I was about in ninth grade I got in a fight with this kid, and I talked about this before, but I remember a thing I said was that ""You haven't been through the suffering I've been through,"" as though I had suffered a lot. And also, he was bending my arm and I said, ""Break it off, break it off,"" and I really...</p> Huh?</p> Yeah. Where the hell had I been through this suffering? I mentioned that I didn't have a father then, but that wasn't the thing I ever actually thought about, that I can remember, that I didn't have a father. So where the hell... You know, I can't... It seems to me that it's somewhere there. 0:42:41.3</p> Yeah, you know, actually I think that is what's happening. You know, why do I feel like - see, I don't even know - why do I feel like shitty about myself then? Why do I feel - why do I do things - like for what? I was set up in that job. You know, I'm going to try to get back in there. I'm going out there today to pick up my check, but I don't want to go into that now, I wouldn't even try, but, you know, why am I so afraid... 0:44:35.8 </p> I never thought of that. The first part I've thought about, not really, you know, the part about proving what the hell it is to be a man, one of the things I thought about was like a man must work. I says, okay. Technically, you know, that's one thing I think is for real.</p> A woman's job. Yeah, that's really a  - </p> Yeah, I never thought of that. I've heard it described in those exact words: ""It's a woman's job."" </p> A policeman, a woman. This is a year ago. She described it to another person as thinking about it as being a woman's job. I guess what I think of as a man's job is something, you know, like competition, business, stuff like that, but I hate that, and maybe I don't, but I've always thought of business as the shittiest thing I could ever get into; I hate it. I says, what do you come in on, what are you coming out with, products or something like that. You know, this is the way I've always thought. </p> It's shit (inaudible at 0:49:56.5).</p> Huh?</p> I was going to go back and see if I could get back on that job. 0:50:14.6</p> It's like I rationalize leaving and I rationalize in going back, too.</p> To this damn job. And if I don't, my goddamn hand is going to come off. I don't know.</p> Hmm?</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I think it - I asked one of the interns about it and he said that he thought it would; that (inaudible at 0:51:50.4).</p> No. Well, the P&C staff director that first night, you know, it's a nuisance.</p>",2
1000133921.txt,"Oh, a new mike?</p> Different?</p> Oh, I thought it was a different color before.</p> Oh, I really did. Must have been the tabletop that it was resting on. I didn't want to come here so much today. It was like an obligation. But now I'm relaxed more about it. I had no specific reason. It was just, I made myself get tired. I guess it was because I still had stage fright. 0:01:25.6</p> So. But now I'm just laughing at myself because it's so repetitious. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. It's not very pleasing to me. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah, partly I didn't want to come here because it's so far. But that's probably not why. I wanted to take a nap but I don't think that's probably why I didn't really want to come. 0:02:28.0</p> Oh well. It's not bad now. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. </p> Well I live on the North side. </p> Well, I thought I was making them up. I thought I was making myself tired because the same thing happened on Tuesday. </p> And usually I do take a nap after school if I don't come here. But usually I'm not tired when I lay down to take this nap either. </p> So that's why I felt that. </p> And the drive. It is long. But if it were something that I really wanted to do I wouldn't mind, I'm sure. 0:03:37.8</p> I was trying to think of a parallel. Like it was, the only thing I could think of were things that friends made me do that really didn't want to do but I felt like I should. </p> I guess I feel I should do this only there's nobody I feel like I should do it for but me. And therefore I don't want to do it. I'd rather take a nap. </p> Yeah but I feel the same way as I..</p> I can just think of doing things with friends that's all. I just didn't want to do it. 0:04:23.1</p> That was exactly the same kind of feeling I had today. </p> Yeah. I don't know who's obliging me. Yeah, the other day the thought struck me that I although I semi-trusted my boyfriend, I mean this came into my head that I felt that I trusted him and then immediately on top of that was the thought that I really don't think that I trust very many people. And maybe it's men, I'm not sure. Probably it's men. 0:05:15.2</p> And in fact I can't remember the last person that I've trusted. But I don't know why. </p> I've nothing else to say about that so I..</p> No. </p> Oh no. I'm afraid of it. </p> Well I feel that he's going to let me down. And I don't know. I don't know how or why. 0:06:19.1</p> I trust him with my feelings. That's the thing. More than trusting him what? To not go out with other women, or trusting him to do what he says he's going to do. I can't trust him with my feelings. And I must have, fuck, had them, must have had something happen a lot of times or something to make this seem like such an astounding thing to me, that's all. It's probably not that astounding. But it really struck me. </p> Yeah. Yeah I guess that's it. I mean to him. Yeah. </p> Yeah. </p> I trust him not to hurt my feelings. That's what I mean. </p> More, to, or is that the same thing? </p> Um hmm.</p> What ever you know. Yeah, yeah. Not make fun of them, maybe, I don't know. </p> I didn't follow you either. </p> Yeah I just didn't, yeah, the very last couple of things you said. </p> Yeah, maybe that's it. When I was thinking about that, something really dissimilar came into my mind. </p> When I worked, I worked for an insurance company for quite a while. And I was a claims adjuster. And I was always like the star, I mean I always did a good job. And then I started going out with this man in the office, this married man. The one that I dated for so long. And it was oh a big messy thing, a horrible thing. And it ended up with both of us getting fired because of this. And that, that was a horrible experience for me. And it was a horrible, not because of getting fired. It was like, it was like, I don't know. It was very personal to me. It's like I was personally what? Like let down? I don't know. I personally lost faith in my boss. And it was really unrealistically shattering to me. I can remember meeting people on the street from that company a long time after that happened and getting very upset when I saw them. Really upset. And that, I don't know if that's related at all. 0:10:26.8</p> My boss, one day I didn't go to work and my boss came to my apartment to see, oh to see if I was there with this man. And then the next day we got fired. I mean I wasn't there with somebody, but it didn't matter. So that was when I felt it was him especially. </p> I don't know either. I guess it's not important either. 0:11:07.3</p> Yeah it was. Yeah, it was like he personally, what did he do? I don't know what he did. He let me down. I don't know exactly how. It was like he and I were very good friends until this happened. Maybe that's it. </p> Yeah, yeah. And then he did that. </p> Yeah, oh yeah. It was ridiculous. Yeah, oh well. </p> Oh well, I don't have anything else to say about it. I don't even know why I was thinking about any, oh wow. </p> I mean I guess that's silly to think about trusting people or something. Maybe I was very naive, I don't know. </p> Um hmm.</p> Um hmm. Yeah. </p> Yeah. Let's see. See I guess I know you should, you should, I guess this is what I think is that you shouldn't need other people, or maybe I feel that it's weak to rely on other people but I want to. To a certain extent anyway. 0:14:41.1</p> If that makes any sense. </p> And I don't know what I'm talking about really.</p> Yeah. But I think that it's ok to need other people if you're, if you can get along without them. Then to be able to get along with them is fine. </p> But you shouldn't just rely on them. And maybe that's what I was doing, or do now. 0:15:35.3</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. </p> No it doesn't. I don't, I really don't think that's good. But I guess that I do this, or feel that I have to do that. </p> Yeah, I, yeah. Does that make sense?</p> I don't know. I guess what I'm asking you is isn't that the right way to be? That's what I'm asking you. </p> This, what I said.</p> Um hmm. See and I always thought I could get along by myself. </p> Yes it is. I always have gotten along by myself. Maybe it was like I was forced to and didn't want to, maybe. </p> I was a fairly fat child. And I really think that had a lot to do with that. Like I didn't go out a lot. I wasn't real fat. But I didn't go out a lot in high school and stuff. And I think I probably really wanted to. </p> I know I did. I can't remember being upset, real upset about it. </p> But maybe I was. </p> Maybe that's, and when I was younger I was alone all the time because we lived in a resort town and in the winter there was nobody else around. </p> So maybe I was just forced to. But I always thought I could be on my own but I just didn't want to be and now I'm almost the other way. 0:18:34.1</p> I feel like I need somebody else. </p> Ever since I've been, I'm 24. And ever since I was 21 I've had a boyfriend almost all the time. And I think that's almost wrong from what, the standpoint I'm talking about. </p> Yeah, I don't think that I felt lonely. But I think that I probably was. 0:19:43.8</p> Yeah, that's right. And now I don't know why I'm talking about this issue.</p> Well I can't see where it, I can't see why I should be because I guess I wasn't, I was just restating what I already thought, that's all. I wasn't, sometimes as you talk you think more and you learn more things but I wasn't then, that's all. </p> Yeah. </p> Now I want to play a toy, I don't know what to talk about. </p> (chuckles) Now I want to play a toy, I don't know what to talk about.</p> I was feeling that I wasn't performing well because I was talking to my roommate about all this trouble that I had Tuesday. And she said that happened to her once. But I can feel it happening all the time. </p> Yeah.</p> Oh yes. I mean I'm not progressing very well I don't believe at all. </p> Oh yes it did. (chuckle) She had a jumping off point though. She was getting a divorce. She had something to talk about. </p> Right. And something traumatic happens to her every week. </p> (chuckles) No, it's just..</p> No, I can't. And I don't know why I get so upset about it. See that really bothers me that I get so upset. I was getting upset on the way home from school today. I mean, yeah I was. And it's about performing, I know it is. </p> I don't know. I don't think that, I don't think it's necessarily you really. </p> Maybe it is you.</p> Maybe it's me. </p> I don't know. There are a hundred names running through my head. </p> Pardon me? </p> Yeah. It reminded me of this dream I had about my mother and I wanted to tell you about it a week ago.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I mean I forgot it Tuesday when I was so stymied. It was right after I was here and I was, maybe it was right after I saw my mother. Anyway I had this dream about my mother. She was a flat, like a pancake doll dressed in pink. And with a coned head on. And her hair was there and, but her eyes were full of hate. And then it would flash to her as she really was and she was saying oh, it wasn't true. But then this doll would come back on full of hate. So maybe I'm performing for my mother since that's the strongest thing that came into my mind. I don't know. 0:25:28.8</p> It doesn't make any sense to me at all. </p> No it isn't.</p> Well she's not here anyway. I mean I..</p> No. </p> Yeah. I mean I never see her. I mean once every two months. That's what I mean. 0:26:06.8</p> You know what?</p> That sounds too Freudian for me to say it, but I'm going to admit it, that's the truth. </p> Oh I don't know. I don't know. I don't know very much about that. But it just you know. </p> It means that everything, almost everything that you do has a meaning first of all. And that it's all related to your childhood and sex</p> That's, that's what I..</p> Yeah. Like having fate govern your life. </p> Yeah. Or being predestined. That, that, yeah. </p> Yeah, yeah. </p> No. It's a very comfortable idea to think that you don't have to do anything. But no I don't like it. I reject that. </p> Yeah. Like behavior patterns. I wonder, do they, are they, do they always start in your early childhood really or can they be developed on like when you're in puberty or something like that? I don't know. I just (inaudible at 0:29:08.4).</p> Let's see. Maybe if you're aware, really aware. More than just saying well I intellectually accept that it's fact. That's different I think than really feeling something. You don't follow that?</p> And really being aware of it. Maybe if you're aware of something you can change it. And the reason that I ask that is that I don't understand, if you think that, that when you're very small how you can really remember or know. 0:30:02.0</p> You don't?</p> Um hmm.</p> I don't remember a lot of things, that's why. </p> So how, if I don't, if I'm not aware of how things that I do started, or why I do things I do, how can I hope to change them. I think. Maybe that's not true. Maybe. </p> Maybe. But see that has to be true because I intellectually know about my compulsive eating. I know about that. I've read a real lot about it and I know about it. But it doesn't help. </p> Or about just, yeah. 0:31:13.3</p> Well I think I do. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. </p> But it's not a blas� how can you change. </p> Yeah. That's true. </p> (chuckles) No. No, I was just, no, I don't know what I was asking.0:32:15.3</p> Maybe I was asking. Maybe I just, maybe I'm looking for, you know, a goal or something. Instead of just being relaxed and I'm not. And I would think, I thought, that I would really like the opportunity just to talk to someone about myself. But I'm finding out that it's very difficult. Maybe I think that it's pointless. </p> Yeah, I did. </p> My reaction to what you said was that, you know, that you were rejecting me. </p> You were telling me, yeah, that I was right. </p> Oh, bad. </p> Sad. I don't know. </p> You to say?</p> Maybe just add at the end that that's not true. </p> I don't remember what was said. </p> Wait. </p> And I have to tell you back what you said to me? 0:35:14.0</p> Ok. </p> What I thought you said?</p> What I'd like. </p> I understand how you feel but you'll find out that it's going to be good.</p> Yeah. If you just relax. (chuckles)</p> It made me feel better. It made me feel more relaxed. </p> I was reassuring myself. I don't know. No, I don't know if that's right. </p> Yeah. I felt like I wasn't on the wall. That's the truth. I mean I felt like I wasn't, I don't know. </p> You know, strapped to the wall or pinned to the wall. </p> Yeah I didn't. </p> Um hmm. </p> I fell like I'm expected to do something. </p> No I didn't. I should have felt more but I didn't because I wasn't me, I was you. </p> I don't know. 0:39:01.8</p> I don't know. I was trying to think of all the things that I felt.</p> I said I was trying to think of other times that I felt like this.</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. I know, I know that I had them but I can't think of anything. There are times that I physically felt like going like this.</p> Like this. </p> No. Moving my head but my body's held in a vice. </p> Get your chair back. </p> Yeah I don't care enough. </p> I don't care enough. </p> Yeah. That's where you're supposed to be. It's like my kids in the classroom. They want their desk in rows instead of in circles because that's where they're supposed to be. </p> Yeah. I don't really ascribe, subscribe to that. </p> Yeah. I am ashamed of my feelings a lot of times. I know a lot of times people have feelings that, you know, probably aren't acceptable. Like maybe, I don't know, an extremely (inaudible at 0:41:24.7) A lot of times I'm very ashamed of my feelings. 0:41:29.0</p> Yeah. They're always awful to me. Even though I'm trying to hide them I feel like they're awful to whoever else is around. </p> No. If I hide them, they don't know. But I want to express them a lot of times but I don't.</p> Yeah but I don't know who they're awful to. Maybe they're awful, I don't think they're awful until I think about the reaction that they'll get. And then I think they're awful but I don't think..</p> Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I used to be real kinda spontaneous. Maybe I got that done a lot. I don't really remember. </p> No, but I, I know that, I know that I was a lot more (inaudible at 0:42:47.6) for sure. </p> And I suppose that's normal but I still want to do these things. Whatever they are, like, just silly things like when I'm walking down the street or something I want to go, I wanted to run down the curb. That's a silly example. Or when I'm happy I want to hug someone. </p> Um hmm. Because I don't think they're acceptable. Yeah, I don't. I don't that's all me. Maybe it is but I don't think that it is. </p> Yeah it is. And I think what upsets me, yeah, what upsets me is that I still have them. Like I feel like I should have outgrown them.</p> Uh huh. Except I act out anger, but I do it badly. I mean what I think is badly. I try not to show it or else I will take it out on an inanimate object. Or if I'm very angry I'll probably cry. </p> But I won't do that in front of anyone. So I guess that's the same thing. I'm still ashamed of it. Like I cannot, it's very difficult for me to say something in anger. In fact I don't know if I hardly ever do.0:44:55.7</p> Yeah they do. Maybe I feel if I talk I would, yeah, I feel if I talk I would say something very hateful or hurting which I really do feel is wrong. </p> And like with all these other things that, I feel that if I, yeah, I could go to extremes. Which probably isn't true. But that's the way I feel though. 0:45:48.3</p> Oh but for all the other feelings too. Not just anger. Does that make sense?</p> What other, I don't know. What other feelings you have. </p> Yeah. </p> Uh huh. Yeah I feel like I could keep it up for a long time. Way past it's normal limit.</p> I don't know what a normal limit is.</p> Yes. And then those, that's probably not true because I don't do any, or very rarely do I do these things. So that's probably why I feel like that. </p> Um hmm. For everything. </p> Um hmm.</p> Um hmm. Both. When I was in the country visiting a friend just a couple of, last weekend, I was out running around in the woods with their ten year old child for like two hours. And, no I didn't feel stupid then. But, I mean that's the kind of thing that I'd do when I was young. </p> Oh yeah. I did. I mean we weren't taking a walk through the woods. We were running through the woods. </p> I was acting like a child, yeah. </p> Um hmm. Yeah, I feel that most adult people don't do those things. Maybe they want to. I don't think they want to though. </p> See that's the thing. </p> Um hmm. </p> Yeah. Except like for expressing love. I'm afraid to. Really. The same as anger, or probably the same amount, I'm afraid. </p> Yeah. I feel that once I let them know that I get it done almost sloppy. </p> Um hmm. </p> No, this is good. Who wants a puppy dog? I don't even want a puppy dog. </p> No it isn't. I feel nicer but I don't know why. </p> Um hmm. More relaxed, that's..</p> Internally. </p> Um hmm. Because I, I just, I've never said that before that's all. Like, and I was only just aware of it the other day. </p> Yeah, because I knew that you weren't going to laugh at me for saying that. The times when I feel the most stupid are the times, I think I've said this before, when I say something that I feel fairly strongly. And I've been watching myself do it for the past several days. And I, you know, it's like I have this, I have a physical reaction to it. And it's almost like kinda silly but it is. It's like, it's like when I buy a gift for someone I'm very excited about it. But when I give it to them, I like want to run away. </p> And I want to run away. </p> Because I don't want to see their reaction to it. </p> Yeah because I'm ashamed of it by the time I give it to them. But before that I was happy about it. </p> Maybe I feel like that or something. </p> Or not like it. </p> But be too polite not to, no they wouldn't laugh. I'd just know that they didn't like it anyway. 0:52:57.2</p> I really can remember, this is something that I can really remember. It's coming home from school and telling my mother about things that I was excited about. And she would say, ""That's nice."" And that's all. And I can remember that, it happening in high school for sure. And I, and I think that's when I started to, when that happens to me it's like I have a constriction right here in my chest. I really do. I mean it's just a physical thing. And I know that's when that started. 0:53:38.3</p> Yeah. I'm sure that's psychosomatic. It doesn't matter that it is or not. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. Kinda. But the only times that you put yourself on the line really are the, when you're saying things about yourself that matter. Otherwise you aren't putting yourself on the line. I mean to me that's true. </p> Oh yes, but that's, hmm. That's an extension of your feelings. </p> Um hmm. What I meant was it's not like in a job. That was what I meant. I'm done. 0:55:49.7</p> I said I'm done. </p> Yeah, I don't, I don't want to start talking about something. Is that all right? </p> No. Now that's not true. 0:56:23.9</p> I felt like I had to go on and on. </p> And I knew that the time was almost over so I wanted to stop. </p> No, I don't think so. </p> Oh yeah I..</p> The sixth, yeah. </p> Ok. Here's my coke. Thank you.</p> Good bye. </p>",2
1000016545.txt,"(Inaudible at 0:00:22.4) beat that thing?</p> Yeah, that's fine. Christmas cards?</p> Have you ever done anything with dream analysis or anything like that?</p> Okay. I was talking to a friend of mine who's trying to get into - I think it's this Jungian Institute. He was thinking about. And he attends these - I think it's called the ""Analytical Psychology Club."" And we were just kind of talking about - apparently, what he does is write down - you know, he writes down his dreams. So I thought I'd try it. 0:01:38.3</p> But I could only recall the last one. So I was really groggy, but I wrote it all down. And it's really kind of - it was really kind of funny because I was real tired, then I felt it rushing away, you know. And, you know, I was trying to catch it and I knew it was slipping back. And - but I did catch it, I just want to tell you. 0:03:44.2</p> Let's see, I was sitting in an office. And one thing I thought I'd never dream about is work. I never can remember dreaming about work. But I was sitting in this office and it was on the second floor and it was by a window. But I couldn't see out the window. And I was sitting at a desk, and it was a big old wooden desk like they have at Public Aid. And I thought I was sitting in the West End office because I thought I was half - the West End office is a Public Aid office, and I thought I was halfway there, except for things that happened later in the dream. I must have been only - well, I know I was on the second floor.</p> Yeah. 0:05:31.5</p> He was big but he wasn't fat. And he asked me if, you know - and so I dialed this number, and there's some things that were a little hazy. But I got the person on the phone, and it was, like - I think it was, like, a small house where - not so much, I didn't see the house. But for some reason, I could see who I was talking to on the phone. And there was music in the background like when my ma used to wash clothes, and I'd wake up in the morning to that kind of music. That's the only thing I could associate with that. And then the woman that answered was a middle aged woman who wore glasses.</p> Yeah, I saw her.</p> I saw her on the phone. And I don't know how that worked. But I saw her and I talked to her. And she started asking me questions like, how old is the child. And I didn't have any idea and I felt like an idiot. And so I asked this guy, how old is the kid? And he said nine or ten months. And none of this makes sense because I never give a male worker a nine or ten month old baby. And I said nine or ten months. And then she said, ""What's his problem?"" And I didn't know what his problem was. So finally I called...</p> Yeah, right. And I - it was like a feeling I get sometimes when I talk to really professional social workers on the phone and they ask me questions like that. And then - so finally, I don't know if I called the guy over. Anyhow, he took the phone and he - I don't know what happened after that. And then later - I don't know what happened then. But later I saw him and I said, ""Did the kid get accepted?"" And he said yeah, and then I got mad because he didn't thank me, and I thought I had done all the damn work on it. 0:07:40.2</p> And then I was - it was weird, I was walking - right after that, I was walking a little. And I happened to glance my right and there - you know, like, on an escalator - you know, the escalator, the chutes the corridor thing. Well, it was stairway, it wasn't an escalator, but it was a stairway to the entrance of the building. And the - to the entrance of my office building, it was the same office. But the West End office, we were on the five - on five floors. I don't know of any stairway just like that. And the stairway - I looked straight down and there were two people down there. And there was a woman. And the woman's face I remember, it was nobody I knew.</p> Yeah, right. And it wouldn't have made sense because it wasn't the couple that had accepted the baby. It was this woman on the phone. And of the - there were five people in the dream. That was the end of the dream then I woke up.</p> The big guy and had a partial face. The woman on the phone, all I remember is glasses. And then the woman on the steps was the clearest face of all. And the man that she was kind of tugging on the sleeve had nothing. I don't even know what shape he was.</p> And I was the fifth person in the whole - oh, and there's one other thing I didn't say. I can't remember if this was part of the dream, or if this was part of what I wrote down about the dream. 0:10:55.8</p> I don't know if that was the thing, - I don't know if that was the thing, like, with the baby. There were other - you know, the woman I kept thinking was my mother, the woman on the phone.</p> Yeah, but see, she was, like - when I was talking to her on the phone, it was like talking to a professional person, like a foster home mother.</p> Yeah, and she wanted - she was asking all these questions. And yeah, that was strange too. It was, like, a private home and yet, I was supposedly calling someone for a professional - you know, like a - when you call an agency or a independent - you know, like, let's say an orphanage, you would talk with a professional. When you talk to a foster home mother, though, they are rarely trained professionally. 0:12:49.0</p> I've never known any to be. And yet, she was asking me questions as though she was a professional, yet I know it was a private home and they had this tinkling music in the background. I don't know, that's - you know, I don't know if it was all part - it had all be part of because it all happened in the same office. I'm not that sharp on, you know, really getting, you know, remembering it clearly. Like, I wouldn't do it every day when I get up (inaudible at 0:13:31.3).</p> You tell me, that's - I don't - nothing seems...</p> No, it was not - it did - it was not my mother. But, like, the association with the laundry room thing. The woman's face was similar, but did - wouldn't have talked like her.</p> Yeah, it...</p> I don't know why. I think the reason I think it was my mother was because of the impression that the - oh, it was like a laundry room. And then this isn't - you know, it doesn't make sense either because why the hell would I call a laundry room? My ma was a homemaker.</p> And yet, you know, it had the association of the radio, you know, or the music when my ma would be washing in the morning. And the - for some reason, it was confusing there, but I thought the woman was a laundry woman. And yet, the picture I have of the woman is that she had speckled black hair with gray in it. She wore glasses and she had on kind of a maroon - I don't know if it was a business suit or what. And she was sitting, but she had stuff all around her. I remember that too. She had - I don't know if... 0:15:20.2</p> Huh?</p> Yeah, yeah, except she didn't...</p> Yeah, and it didn't make any sense why - if I say it's my ma, you know, it doesn't jive.</p> Well, why would I call my (inaudible at 0:15:55.8) - I don't know anything about dreams. But why would I call my ma, you know, if I'm at work? Supposedly, the dream is - you know, you hang together on your - I don't know if dreams are supposed to hang together or what. I know totally nothing about - I never remember my dreams. The things I remember most was the feeling I had when the guy didn't thank me. And I says...</p> Okay. But - the woman - it doesn't even - it doesn't, you know, it doesn't - I cannot figure it out. I think it was my ma but it didn't look like my ma. So it couldn't be my ma.</p> It didn't look like her. It wasn't my ma. It wasn't my ma's - unless I wrapped her up in something else. It was a woman I didn't know.</p> Not in the dream I didn't.</p> Yeah and when I tried to figure out whether - in the dream it was a woman I didn't know. But there were little things around it, like, the radio, the music.</p> Afterwards.</p> In the dream - in the dream itself I - it - you know, it seemed to go together. Things just happened. It was crazy the way it happened. You know, it - to me it - in the dream it was just a very, you know, rational thing to have happen.</p> And with the baby I can't remember - okay, well, I'll try (inaudible at 0:17:44.3). There were little segments that, you know, I can't pin down as to why I don't think it was my ma. Things were all around this woman. Like, I think there was a - an ironing board in front of her, a basket to the right of her, some crap like that. And yet, she was answering the telephone and talking. When my ma would work things would be, you know, very proper and she'd have plenty of space to work. You know, for some reason, I don't want to call it my ma.</p> Well, I don't know. It's just so covered up.</p> Yeah, but how can my mind make, like, an imaginary person that I've never seen up, you know?</p> Okay, in the dream I wanted to talk to that lady to find out if I could get a friend's kid accepted for placement. So I was, like, looking to her to provide a home for a kid. And I was doing this for another worker.</p> And she made me feel uneasy by asking me questions.</p> Yeah. But the reason I felt uneasy I don't think was so much because of, you know, the fact that there were questions, I felt uneasy because I didn't know the answers.</p> And so I had to keep asking this other guy, you know, ""How old is the kid, and what's the matter with him?"" And, you know, questions which any idiot...</p> That one wasn't answered. That question wasn't answered. It was at that time that I can't - I don't know if I don't remember or if it phases out.</p> But somehow he got the phone and completed the conversation.</p> Well, no, I finally - you know, I - the feeling I had was that, you know - I can't remember. After the second question, ""What's wrong with the kid,"" then I just - I somehow - you know, I said, well - I put the phone on my desk. I says, ""You take it.""</p> I don't know if it was that so much, it was just that I didn't want to be bothered anymore asking all - you know, she was asking the questions. I can't do it. If it would have been my kid I would have known.</p> (Inaudible at 0:22:01.9).</p> No.</p> Oh.</p> It might mean something, but I really don't want to - you know, it sounds too crazy.</p> No, I don't want to think about it. It...</p> How do you know it didn't - you know, how do you interpret them, though? How do you know?</p> (Inaudible at 0:23:06.7). I don't want to (inaudible at 0:23:08.3).</p> Because I went - I went at it from a lot of angles but not from that angle.</p> The - okay, if I was trying, you know, to - if I was trying to get myself in, you know...</p> Yeah, she asked typical questions.</p> That any foster mother asks me when I pick up the phone.</p> Yeah.</p> That - I didn't even think of that. And not only that, but it would have been - oh, yeah.</p> Okay, I'm not trying to get out of it. I don't think I am. But I did another thing yesterday, which maybe precipitated it. You know, don't let me off that in case I want to get off because I got a feeling I want to get off that.</p> But yesterday afternoon, I sat down and I typed, you know, all the things I could recall in any way came across my brain. And on some of the things, like, for instance, the phrase I keep repeating, like, I don't really understand why I don't take respon - you know, all this (inaudible at 0:25:59.8), you know, just, you know, popped out so many times. When I got to that section, you know, where I was typing away on that, I somehow got around to the idea that - well, it has to do with sexuality. 0:26:30.3</p> And to have confidence...</p> In your own balls and stuff like that. And I - all of a sudden I thought back to a time when I was circumcised. I was circumcised I think when I was four or five. And the conditions under which I was circumcised was, my ma told me - we lived in a small town. And she told me that we were going - we were going on a holiday or we were going to some place to stay in the city and it would be lots of fun. And there would be a nice room and we would have candy, you know, all this stuff.</p> Yeah, and nobody told me. When I got to the hospital and I was taken to this damn room and nobody told me. Nobody even told me it was a hospital. You know, I didn't know what was going on. And I was real little I remember that. And they took me into this room, and they still used ether in those days. And, you know, they put this crap on my nose and then this nurse started talking dumb talk, you know, about bicycles and things like that. And I remember she told me to count down from a hundred. And I got to 97 and I zonked out. 0:28:34.3</p> Hmm?</p> No, no, and...</p> Well, and what it does - you know, what it does is - well, you wake up and, you know - and you don't even know you're going to get cut up like that. And - oh, and you're vomiting too. You're really vomiting.</p> Yeah, yeah, and well - when I typed it up I was - I just got furious because I never realized what this did, like, to my ideas of trusting people.</p> I don't think at the time I ever - you know, I didn't - when I woke up I was mad. You know, I remember just being really mad. And my ma - I don't think my ma had an explanation. And now when I think about, I think it was like, you know, being castrated. And - you know, and I don't understand to this day why it was done...</p> Why it was done so late, yeah. Why wasn't it done right away when I was born? Why - you know, I don't think there was any - I can't remember going to any doctor before that.</p> No, no, I don't think he was alive anymore. I must have been five years old.</p> Yeah, but she didn't tell me, she didn't tell me anything. She didn't - she didn't...</p> Worse than that - worse than that, I wonder why she did it. I really wonder why she did it.</p> Yeah, I - to this - well, I never even thought about it. But I remember things, like, in gym class, you always had to deal with - you know, when I started gym class it was about in seventh grade. And in gym classes, I kind of ran over this too. It was a big deal, like, how big your pecker is. And if you're small, the guys laughed and I was pretty small.</p> Right and they can give you a shot for that, but they got to get it there, otherwise, you can become sterile if that isn't done.</p> I didn't know any of this. I didn't - I didn't, you know (inaudible at 0:32:23.8). But I didn't know any of that.</p> And when I came back home I had to tell my ma.</p> I think it was just a general physical. I was also sick a lot when I was a kid.</p> This was just a...</p> Yeah, and also there was no pubic hair yet.</p> I don't know if it was in tenth grade. It was, you know - it was when you were already in the area where you had gym class. And so he says, ""Well, we can give you a couple of shots."" So he gave me a couple of shots and then things started happening. But - oh, and I had to come back home and I had to tell my ma that I had shots. I had to get shots because, you know, things weren't growing right. Which is was another - but, you know, I couldn't face her. I told her when I was in the gym. 0:33:12.3</p> Oh, really. Yeah, and then - well, like, in about two hours yesterday afternoon I just sat and thought about that, you know. And I - as far as my trusting, you know, people especially women, I don't think I trust them. It really caused me to wonder about - and for instance, when I did - when this girl did get pregnant, you know, why was I such an idiot, you know, to get her pregnant? You know, I didn't take any precautions at that time. The thing with my ma...</p> Okay, now...</p> Okay, all that - that stuff - I had other things, there were other things to that. Because I was trying to figure out, like, in high school I didn't date girls. And I says, of course, I probably didn't if I had - I was living with my mother, my sister and my grandmother, was the three biggest influences of my life.</p> Yeah, my...</p> Yeah, well, that I didn't know till later, but I had this bad experience with that. I never - you know, I never made any of the high school girls - none of them, my sister had (inaudible at 0:34:57.0). All her friends were good looking chicks, (inaudible at 0:35:00.6) all the time. 0:35:05.7</p> I had another word for her too, I think ""liar."" I think that was the other one too because she really did lie. You know, she really did lie to me.</p> I can't understand...</p> Huh?</p> Not liar, but I was feeling something before about - about that I just - that I don't trust now. And I really don't trust - it's hard for me to trust a girl. I'm not so sure if I trust men either, but I - a woman...</p> Yeah, I don't trust...</p> I (inaudible at 0:36:42.6).</p> The only way I could...</p> The only way I can soften that is by saying that...</p> Because I'm trying to understand my - you know, my ma. But I don't know, she...</p> Yeah, I know that, you know.</p> I don't want to believe it because then I would think that there were other things going on in the back of her head that were much more than just a liar.</p> Why would she really have me circumcised when I was that old?</p> I don't know if - like, she's not that sophisticated a woman. It would have to be on sheer instinct.</p> But if that would - you know, if that would serve to - I don't know (inaudible at 0:38:20.0).</p> She doesn't read ""Reader's Digest.""</p> She reads the local paper period and she listens to the TV.</p> But then, why didn't she tell me that's (inaudible at 0:38:45.3)? Unless, you know - unless she thought she couldn't get me there.</p> You know, like she'd done all along.</p> Then it makes me feel bad just to...</p> Well, she's my mother first of all.</p> I don't know. I always want to - I'll - you know, I'll think of things but then I'll - I always want to excuse them about her by saying that - you know, things like she was doing her best, stuff like that.</p> Which doesn't change...</p> What she still did.</p> I still think that, you know, there's something more than she was just, you know, trying to protect me because I really don't - her ideas then of protecting...</p> Well, no, it makes sense to me, you know. The reason it makes sense is because, like...</p> I can think those, I can't feel them very easily, though. I can think - like, I - yesterday afternoon I thought a whole bunch of other things that, you know - that kind of just ran off that thing. Now I don't know if I was hunting for things or what, but that would have followed from that, which I could think, but my anger was really just at the point of when - well, I think because when I woke up from ether I was so mad.</p> I just - I can't think of anything rottener to do to a little boy at that age. I think I must have been five. I mean, that to me was just a - it's like every time my ma has done that. Like, when my sister got pregnant. I didn't know a damn thing about it, and I came walking in like a complete ass, and there's my sister, you know, about seven months pregnant and I didn't even know about it. You know, that's her (inaudible at 0:43:15.6).</p> Yeah, yeah, that's (inaudible at 0:43:23.3). Yeah, my sex education was confined to one sentence when I was in ninth grade. And a big hairy promise to always be a gentleman, that was it, you know, one lousy sentence.</p> I think I said this last time when I was home over Thanksgiving, I asked my ma, you know, what was my dad like, you know, and how affectionate were we and all this shit? And she said that in their household, you know, affection was considered a sin, affection, you're not screwing, just affection.</p> And...</p> Well, probably pretty good. I think my dad was a good, you know - I think when she...</p> I don't know. I remember my ma screwing once (inaudible at 0:44:18.6).</p> I don't know. That's one of my earliest memories. I don't know, I never told her. I wonder what she - I should test her on it just to see what she would do. One time when I was going through these think back deals, we used to live in a little house that was separated. The kitchen was separated from the living room by a curtain. That was our first house for seven years.</p> Sex was late at night, never tell the kids, all this sort of thing. Don't tell your mom and dad about it. Oh, God, she'd never tell her mom and dad if she had a boyfriend. It was a big scene when she had to even do that. But anyhow, one night I remember. It was one of these late at night things. And all I heard was the screen door open and I heard low, muffled voices. But it was some guy and I know they took out the - we had this little rollaway. 0:46:13.5</p> Oh, God, (inaudible at 0:46:40.4). Oh, I was - no, I was - I must have been jealous. And I thought she was getting hurt. I think that's...</p> I want to reject that, but I was crying because I thought she was getting hurt.</p> Maybe, I don't - I don't know about that. But I just remember that and I know my ma didn't know that I knew that.</p> That she - she - well, she's never known that I knew that. Somehow I think I knew who that was. That's maybe a - that same day, it seems to me on the same day that that - I don't know, this might be just trying to pile something up. But on the same day that that happened, a person had stopped an old car earlier in the afternoon. And it seems like it was my father's brother. His name was Donny. But I don't know if that happened on the same day. 0:49:09.3</p> I don't know, it flows together, I can't remember. Because I didn't recognize any voices, I don't remember any voices. But it seems to me he stopped there that same day and he only - all I remember is his car I don't remember him.</p> Um-hmm.</p> I only met him once and he was killed somewhere. That's - you know, that's the way it was. It was always - both of my ma's boyfriends that when they were finally introduced, it was a scene.</p> A big scene, first time, both of the ones she ever dated for a long time.</p> First time it was a - you know, I knew he was coming, it was the same damn thing. She would put the kids to bed and, you know, he'd come in late at night. And she'd think we were sleeping, you know. I don't know how dumb she thought us kids were. But I usually - I don't know, I usually couldn't go to sleep then either. I don't think they were messing around or anything. And - see, usually what I could anticipate on which night this guy was coming. And usually I'd go over and sleep at my grandmother's. 0:50:44.8</p> And on one night I was balling again and I left. And I just stormed out of the house and I ran over to my grandmother's house. And then I told my grandmother that my mom was seeing this guy. And I must have said something like I wasn't welcome around there or something like that. And then my ma came over that night and, you know, introduced him, like, you know, guilty as hell kind of thing. And the other time was - it was a similar sort of thing.</p> Yeah. Oh.</p> What can you read on the dreams? What would be a good thing to read on them, is there anything that - or is it more of less what I think the dream means?</p> There's nothing really to read?</p> Maybe I'll snatch (inaudible at 0:52:24.6). Do you ever interpret any of your own?</p> Yeah, same to you, have a good Christmas.</p> See you on the 7th.</p>",2
1000017883.txt,"Something very interesting happened Saturday. I came to a conclusion why when I was at my sister's and I couldn't understand that ... like I was really uptight. I stayed with a sister, a step-sister, for a year and a half and I brought my girlfriend, who I live with out there for a confirmation. So we're sitting at the house and she sees (ph) all the hiccups (ph) that went back and forth (chuckling). And I never realized them so strongly until I could just sit back and analyze a little bit. Seeing my sister get real jealous and things like this and seeing my brother-in-law ... (chuckles). My girlfriend walked in and he was like ... (chuckles) ... you know ...</p> Well ... no, no, no, no, he was like ... let's see, I think they were discussing something, and she said what set him off is she crossed her legs - she has very sharp legs - and she says after that, Jesus Christ, he wouldn't leave her alone! (chuckling) And it was so funny. And I saw it and I noticed ... he used to do this to me too when I was living there. ""Come on out and listen to my piano,"" and all this baloney. And I said to myself ... and then my sister calls me out of the room, you know, I was out there too, and she says, ""Oh, I just wanted to ask about when your taxi (ph) is,"" all this baloney. In other words, she knew I was out on the porch with her husband, and she didn't want me out there and I knew it. But I don't think she knew my girlfriend was out there. She'd be even more worried! (chuckling) But it's just like ... I realize now like when I was there, how it was that I couldn't really ... I can't really explain, like whether it was a feeling or whether it was ... like what it was, but I didn't realize how hung up I was being there even. And it's like now I see it, like for a year and a half, it was like, Jesus, you couldn't talk to him and if ... I noticed sometimes she went out to the store and he had me in the back porch listening to some music and he was talking to me in the kitchen, completely innocently. He didn't try anything, he never tried to kiss me, he's never tried to do anything. But right away, you feel that, like she's walking in and it's almost written all over her face, ""What were you doing with my husband,"" you know? (chuckling) Only talking! [0:02:11.5]</p> Yeah. And that's why ... and this is like maybe the first time ... I mean, I did know she was jealous. I knew that before. But I didn't realize the extent of the animosity going back and forth even between the two of them. She's always cutting him down. He holds his temper, he doesn't cut her down. But it's like, you know, he holds it inside. So in other words, he's got the feeling reaction, maybe when nobody else is around, he cuts her down. Things like this. So I just thought, ""Jesus."" </p> Yeah. Right. And I guess ... you know, like I'm not completely over things. Like last night, I know when we were ... my two friends and myself, we have a crazy relationship! (chuckling) First day we meet, we go out and eat dinner together [my two married friends] (ph) and they're like ... it's so great, though, that it's just like a relationship where I still say I care for him more as a friend, not because he's a man, but because of just some of the things he did, like with the pizza last night. We said, ""Let's split the last piece three ways,"" his wife says. He says, ""On no, you girls didn't have as much as I did, so you split it."" You know, things like ... just little things like this, but you notice them. Just like real sweet things like that that he does and this is one of the reasons I think he's a little bit closer, but they're real, you know, really, really close, like the three of us. [0:04:40.7]</p> Yeah. When he's talking, I would. But I mean, it doesn't hurt me like it used to. I still find myself saying ... a little voice saying, ""Well maybe if I pay a little bit more ... LOOK like I'm paying more attention or that I'm more engrossed in what he's saying, then maybe he'll ..."" But I figured, ""Now look, maybe whatever he's got to say at this time, has got to be said ... or should be directed more towards this person than towards the other person. So what's the big deal? Or even if he did think she was cuter or more sexy or whatever the thing is, so what? But it's like, I can still feel it a little bit and then I stop myself (ph) and say, ""Uh uh, no, no, no, no. Not this again. Just because he reminds you of your grandfather ..."" and I think that's what it is, it's like I want all the attention. And you say, well, you know, you can't do it, so, it still hurts a little bit. I'm the first to admit it, but it's like, when he pays attention to me or when he comes up after class and says something to me, it's like ""Oh!"" (chuckling) But it's not as bad. It's not like a real rejection just because he doesn't talk as much to me. I don't ... you know ... and I really feel good about that because at one time it would have hurt me like hell if I liked somebody that much and like he didn't pay any ... he pays attention, but not quite as much. One time, boy, that would have killed me, destroyed me utterly ... [0:06:33.3]</p> Yeah. Yeah, I do see that. I suppose if I were completely over this, it wouldn't even bother me, or I wouldn't even bother to look for it. But I guess it's because I'm not quite ... not quite over that. I'm over it enough so that I know that what I'm doing ... at least I know that I'm trying to do something for whatever reason. At one time, it would just be like ... like I would think I wasn't good enough or something like this. It would be that type of an attitude. Now it's not bad, it's just that I understand that what I'm doing is looking for attention from this person who reminds me of somebody else. And so it's like when he doesn't pay as much attention, it's just a little bit of a hurt, but I know why, because this would be like saying my grandfather came back and now he doesn't want to pay any attention to me, you know, and I understand this. But it's still like I find myself still just falling back a little bit into trying to [play up] (ph) something he WILL pay more attention and then I say, ""Oh, the hell with it!"" And the funny thing is when I say, ""the hell with it,"" and start relaxing, he pays more attention to me. (chuckling) It's so dumb, that I realize that I do it and it's like (inaudible) oooo, what you're saying like this. And all of a sudden saying, ""Oh, the hell with it,"" you know, start smoking my cigarette or drinking my coffee, and then he turns around and says something to me. (inaudible) [0:08:06.9]</p> Until like my girlfriend came out with, ""Oh, I've known him for a long time, he's tried that baloney with me,"" and it just ... just a little twang there and I could still feel like I was second even on this, you know? (chuckling)</p> I mean from an idiot that you couldn't care less, just the idea that he hit her before he even hit me. And it's like ... that was the only thing that really bugged me.</p> Yeah, it was such a dumb thing and the guy was not worth two cents as far as in that area. He might ... he's a very helpful fellow, a very nice fellow in his own way, but like, oh ridiculous in that emotional feeling.</p> Yeah. Right. In fact, the funny thing is, is I did kind of like him when I first met him because he was very nice and very friendly and he introduced me around and he helped me with tumbling (ph). Really nice guy. And then he comes out with something [that was, jeez that was so uncool] (ph), he just went CHOONG! And blew everything we started. But I mean it was just that little twang when I found out ... it was almost like he does it ... see this bugs me. Again, with my boss, it was the same way. I didn't mind the idea of him even so much when I found that he was playing, you know, he was trying to play around and see what he could get for nothing. But it's like the idea is that when my girlfriend came out and said, ""Well he would have done it to anybody,"" that's like saying, ""aw s***,"" like ... if I were some kind of special challenge or some kind of different thing, it would be okay. But it's just like, ""Aah, you're just like (ph) anything else"" anything marked 'female' I would go after. And it's like ... it makes me feel so low</p> Yeah. That's true. Like it wouldn't make any difference what body was there (chuckling), that's what he was after. It's female. Good. But it's like ... that really [kind of bugged me] (ph). And it bugged me again the other night when I found this out. Just a tiny bit. It wasn't as bad as it was when I found out that my boss was doing ... my boss ... and I was so mad because I won't pay any attention to him. I went out to dinner with him a couple of weeks ago, and he went to say good night to me and he went to take a hold of my arm and I shook his hand and said, ""Thank you very much for the dinner"" and he (inaudible) (chuckling) And he went, ""Oh. Okay."" He didn't try anything. He didn't know what to do or what to say. He didn't ... it was really funny. And then ... I guess ... see, he left me because he had to run for a train and I wasn't finished eating. I said, ""Okay, good night."" I'm drinking my wine, I didn't care. (chuckling) To hell with you. But it was like ...</p> Yeah.</p> Right. Right, right, right. In the end, he's going to be the one that's not going to know what's coming off and it's not going to be me, because like ... it's like ... I guess he figures ... and maybe that's why being an older man and playing around with a young girl, he doesn't expect ... well I'm not really that young, but I mean, you know, proportionately, I'm a lot younger than he is. And girls in their early 20s usually are pretty na�ve yet, you know, where fellows are concerned. Like that one day (ph) you know (chuckling) ... it's so funny that I won't play and I don't WANT to play his game anymore, which is something. He'll still sometimes come up and try to take my arm. [And I say} (ph), ""Will you be good?"" (chuckling) (inaudible) He's goes like this, he goes ""Uuh."" </p> Right. In some way, and so then it was like ... I guess everything just followed (ph) through, you know, you feel like as a little kid ... because I was raised on the type that you do something wrong, you get punished, that type of thing. And it's usually ... it has to do with physical. Like if I was really bad, my mother would spank me and things like this. And so I guess that's where I sort of transferred over to a physical thing, you know, in that way sickness, because I did something to my mother and then she got sick or something because she didn't ... you know, something on this order. And I don't know, it's funny, the last time I saw her there was something new when I left her. Like I hadn't felt ANYTHING, like ... Jesus, I went out there all the time and I never felt anything and like the last time ... and it almost didn't sound like ME, it's weird, like sometimes you have something rehearsed, ""Now this sounds good so I'll say it,"" you know. But like this just came out, and it was really kind of a beautiful way, just ... it just came out, I just took my hand and I put it on her cheek and I said, ""Remember, Mom ..."" what was it ... oh, ""Remember, Mom, that I love you, I really love you."" And it just came out. It wasn't something that I had practiced or anything. [0:18:13.4]</p> Yeah, and that it wasn't something like saying, ""Yeah, I love you,"" or, you know, because that's what she wants to hear. But it's just something that came, it seemed like, from very deep within. It's finally starting to get out. And it just came. It just came out. And it was really ... I thought it was kind of a beautiful thing that it just ... I could really start to feel with her, or for her, or whatever, and not just like ... I don't know, the way I used to be was just ... I'd go there because it was an obligation or whatever, and I didn't really care. And I guess that's maybe why when I saw this other girl that was kind of like that too, it was like ... ""I care about me, what's going on with me, and I'll smile and I'll be nice to you, but like I really don't want to help you or I really don't want to communicate with you. I don't care. I just want to get to be best or whatever, or I want to improve and I don't really care what kind of interaction I have with you."" And I kind of felt like ... this is why when I saw her, I kind of realized that I was like this myself. I wanted people to come to ME, and do things for ME, or help ME out. But I didn't want to come out and go halfway to people. </p> Yeah, I feel like I'm starting to break through. I remember a couple of weeks ago, I felt like running. It was the weirdest thing. Not running away, but just running, because I felt free. I don't know what I had gone through, whether it was in therapy or I had been thinking about something at home, but it just ... I guess I just came to some kind of a conclusion or resolution or something. And I just felt so free. It's just like ...""Aah, I want to run and feel good!"" And it doesn't ... [0:20:19.6]</p> Yeah. Right. It's kind of weird. I don't understand ... this is like a symptom, I guess, with me usually, is that ... well of course I was at my sister's and smoking like a fiend and eating and everything else because of all egos (ph) are running this way and that way and the other way and you're going, ""Aaaa..."" (chuckling) ... But Sunday too, I found myself so depleted and everything that ... well part of it was a little bit of an inferiority thing too. There were two things. My girlfriend was going to have this one girl over and is very sharp, was in her modeling class, she's doing all sorts of modeling. She's very sexy, very pretty, the whole baloney, you know. So she was going to be over. And I remember my girlfriend ... first of all, I didn't like the idea that she had told me before, ""I'm having ...,"" she said, ""I'm having company Sunday."" I said, ""Good, now I have to figure out what I can do Sunday so I'm out of the house."" And then she asked me like Saturday night when we get home and we're ready to go to bed, ""Oh, if you want to stay for dinner, you can."" Well I mean you know she told me like three days or four days beforehand that she was having company and then she asked me at the last minute if I want to stay. Well I didn't like that, for one thing. Because it was like, ""Well I'll throw it in because after all, you did ask me to go to your sister's so maybe I should be nice ..."" you know, it was almost like she felt like she had to pay me back, and I said, ""The hell with that."" </p> Yeah, because all these things were hitting, but what I realized, when I came home, there wasn't anything near like I was afraid to say, ""hi,"" to her, and there was even a fellow there who I'd known before who I thought was kind of sharp and who used to go with one of my other girlfriends. And like when I walked in, it was like ... I guess now it was because I had like refurbished whatever I had within me something, that I could just walk in and I said, ""Oh hi!"" and went and got myself a drink and sat down. And there was no problem. We sat and talked for about a half an hour and she went home. But it was ... you know, I could feel that before it was like ... I guess maybe mostly it was just excuses, like, ""Well I can't get along with this girl, I'm afraid of this, I'm afraid of that, and I'm afraid of the other. I've got to get out of the house."" But I don't know, I guess that's when little things like that can bug you and sort of bog you down and things like that with friendships even and communication. I find myself doing that. I'll pick at little things and they probably won't be the real reason for why I'm feeling the way I am, but at least now I know that when I get like that, I've got to get out. I don't want to have any interaction with anybody. I've got to get out by myself.</p> Yeah. And it's not only that. Sometimes it's ... that thing was so irrelevant that I don't even think about it, it just ... you know, just ... it's almost like an excuse, you know, it's like I'm thinking now I've got to think of some reason why I'm so uptight or something and then I've got this one and that one and the other one. Look, I've got four reasons, you know? And I guess, but when you come right down to the whole thing of it, it's like the real reason is, is there's just nothing more in here to give. And like I would just be faking it, you know, whatever I have, and I just have to get out. I have to be by myself and learn to whatever again. [0:24:09.1]</p> Yeah, it does. Because otherwise sometimes you don't know ... I don't know, yet, anyway. Sometimes I might be on sort of a halfway right track but not completely. Like with little things, I don't mind changing my life for little things. Like sometimes you may do something that really irritates somebody. Well if it does, and you know it and they tell you or whatever, well you're going to stop it if it's not something that's completely inherent in you that if you changed it you'd be changing your whole life. And so you just stop it. And so ... like this is why I think it's nice and that if you're doing something that people really react to and it's nice to ... I think it's nice too for them to say something and then you can feel like, ""Well, this is a good quality that's there."" [0:26:12.2]</p> Yeah. And I probably looked just as bad. (inaudible).</p> Yeah. And partly, she's coming out of it a little bit, she's coming out of the bag she was in and now she's getting fellows too that start ... you know. But still, it's like when they go to parties, like it's a little group from the office all sit together and she's one of them ... sit together and the girls fall all over the fellows and I think, ""Oh you dummies, Monday morning are you going to be talked about in the back room!"" But it's like ... you know, now I can do that. At one time if somebody, no matter who he was or where he was or whatever, if he started to pay any attention to me, it would just be like ""Ahh!""</p> Yeah. I do feel that way. But my girlfriend says, ""Sometimes I feel like ..."" what did she say ... ""I put more worth on you than you do."" She says, ""Not so much anymore, but it's still there a little bit."" It's like ... there's still inferiority complexes that when I get next to somebody I still kind of compare when they're very much higher than I am. It's still a little bit, but it's not ... it's not to the point where it's sickening, you know, (chuckling) when you're like, ""Oh Christ!"" You know, you put yourself next to them and ... ""Okay, 80 percent when you should be 95,"" you know, all this. And it's just like I can really start to interact with people. Like with my teacher on Saturday, she's such a great girl, and yet like ... my one girlfriend says, ""You know, like a year or two ago, you probably never would have met her because you weren't open at all. Now you're starting to open just a little bit. It's going to take a while, but you're starting to open a little bit."" And I said, ""Yeah, I can feel it now, because these people that are there, that can give or can whatever .. whatever it is that attracts people together is there."" And it's like ... things like I think there's going to be like a lasting relationship with lots of people now. Maybe not for life, but like something that's ... well I don't know, like Chrissie last night came because my hair is always falling apart when I'm at the gym place and she brought me these bands, these little bands. And it's just like ... people will do that and then next week I'll probably find something that I can bring her or do for her or whatever it is, whatever presents itself, if I notice she needs something or whatever, I'll see if I can take care of it or get it for her or do whatever. But it's like, I haven't really experienced this type of thing. I've experienced people who were like me, you know, they'll talk to somebody and they're very outgoing, I mean I never had problems when I went to a party or wherever talking to somebody. I always ended up talking to somebody. But lots of times like after the party, I just walk out and that would be it. You would never see anybody again, you would never ...you know. [0:30:14.2]</p> Yeah, it's like ... and I feel like it's not just going maybe this far, but going lots further and not being ... see my big thing was not that I don't think it was even so much not being able to communicate, even love, but it was almost like a fear of it. And yet, I don't know, a friend of mine said too that sometimes ... we were talking about my home, and she said, ""Well, how come you feel like she took her love back? Usually somebody has to do something in order for you to take your love back. You can only give so much and then finally you just say, 'That's it. There's no more to give.'"" And I said, ""Yeah, I did get to be very sullen and very ... like in a shell. I was like by myself. This is why I say I reminded myself of this Laura that she can smile very superficially, she's very nice and everything, but no communication, I mean it's like you talk to her and it goes CHOONG! Or CHOONG! But she's here. (chuckling) And it's like ... and I guess maybe that's partly the way I was. I don't know exactly WHY I got that way, but I do know I was like that. I was so much in a shell for a long time. People couldn't even touch me, I was like stone, really. And then when I went to Mrs. Mower's, it got to the point where ... well she was very nice and she was very grandmotherly and everything, but she wasn't strict enough, which is funny because like the other place was too strict. This place wasn't strict enough, it was like she didn't really care, you know? </p> Yeah, and I tried to open up a little bit, but as soon as somebody would do something that I would think was turning against me, that would be it. You wouldn't get ... they wouldn't get the old proverbial ... what is it ... to forgive seven times seven? It wouldn't be that. One time, that's it, CHOONG! That's it. You know, you've crossed me, that's it, no forgiveness, I don't care if I misunderstood. Whatever it is, you're dead. That's it. And ...</p> Yeah, and it was like, I felt this, like I was ... I wouldn't let you get real close to me. If you get just so far, but then if you did anything ... anything, it wouldn't be ...I used to hang around with this one girl for like three years and I saw her the other day, she was going to have a ... I guess her baby died and they had to take the baby from her. She was only two or three months along in pregnancy. And I saw her and I could play cards with her. Partly I threw some things out that I wanted to see if she would think and communicate with me a little bit in that area. She couldn't. It was right away, it was like, ""Oh, Jesus."" I said something about Chrissie [getting this] (ph) (inaudible) and they're throwing pennies and we were playing this crazy game, we'd throw pennies and if you get a seven, so I said ""Oh well you were a racist anyway, Lincoln"" you know, I'm throwing this stuff in. And I was doing it partly to be funny or at least to get a reaction or to ask ... have somebody say, ""Well why did you say that?"" or ANYTHING. But there was like nothing there, so I threw out a couple more things, you know like, ""Well maybe they'll catch this one, at least."" I wouldn't care if she turned around and said, ""What the hell did you say that for? I don't believe that,"" and then give some whatever why she believes ... But nothing. And I thought, ""Well I can't communicate with a person on this level like 'oh, my baby does this and my baby does that and my husband's doing (inaudible)"" [0:34:34.3]</p> Yeah. But you know the one I would like to get back with a little bit as far as being a friend is my sister Michelle, because I started calling her that now again. Like for a long time, I didn't want to, you know ... well, she's my step-sister, whatever, you know, I lived with her for a while, if I have to say that. But now ... I told Jodie, I said I would really like to get back with her because ... okay, so she's emotionally kind of mixed up. But out of all of them, she can give love freely, I mean really give love. And not ... as many times as she's been knocked down, which I think is really great, she's in still need of love. And she's not completely jealous and things like this. Like my sister wouldn't even ... you know, she didn't want to give my godchild around to other people, like all the people that were there ... hold him for a little while and things. She puts him in this damn playpen. I was so mad Saturday night, because here he is, there's my godchild and he's sitting in this stupid playpen. There's two other babies there, everybody's holding the babies. Not my son, or my godson. But it's like she's saying, ""This is mine. You can't have it."" And I thought like I would have been just the same way. [0:36:14.4]</p> Yeah. And this is why it really bugged me. And she tried to do something to me too when I walked in the door. I would never have realized because I would always have felt guilty. We were late about 20 minutes. I mean the transportation was bad Saturday night. We had to take two buses and two ELs. They wouldn't even bother to pick us up from the station or anything, so you know, like, all right, so we were about 15 or 20 minutes late. I had done lots of things for that ... that party. You know, like I baked a ham and all sorts of crazy ... well, it was canned but it was a four-pound ham and things like this, and I had done lots, and I bought lots of things for it. And I walk in the door, and the first thing she says (angrily), ""Boy, if we had to depend on you for our dinner, we wouldn't eat at all."" And things like this. You know, I'm not like saying well I'm glad you could make it, it was such rotten weather, or ... you know, something like this. The thing wasn't supposed to start until 6 o'clock ...</p> That's right. And here you are, you spend half the day looking for stuff for them.</p> And it was like a hassle. That's why I think I needed that day that next day, I needed six or seven hours just for me, and to hell with everybody and everything. I just had to get out. 0:38:05.6</p> Well what makes me so damn mad is that I took it! It was like I was so afraid of rejection that it was just like rather than be rejected, I would take any kind of bull that anybody threw out. It's not even ... </p> Yeah, I'm angry at myself and ...</p> Yeah. I'm angry at myself in the fact that I put up with it because it lowers my self-esteem, my respect for myself, but it's not only that. When I do that, when I let her walk on me, all I'm doing is reinforcing what she does to her husband. He won't talk either. He won't talk back. He'll just go along. And if they do start a fight, she almost always comes out with the last word. And he just says, ""Oh the hell with it. I can't talk to her so I'll just walk away or just let her think she won."" So she stands there victorious, she thinks, and she's losing her husband day by day. If he wasn't so much in debt ... </p> If he wasn't so much in debt, my sister wouldn't have a husband right now and I know it because he's a good looking guy, he's pretty intelligent, he's not real educated or anything, but he's pretty intelligent. And he's good looking. And he's just a nice guy. When he comes off his hard exterior that she helps put him on ... like when we went to leave, he walked us to the door, and my girlfriend noticed this and I've always noticed that he's been very gentle with me too, not with her. He's not gentle with her because she's not gentle with him. But it's like he walks out and he said, ""Well make sure that you girls now take it easy and be careful going home,"" and real soft and real nice. That's not the same guy that talks with at other times. And it just makes me so sad that they ... partly I guess it's because it's kind of a selfish thing thinking like, this would have been me. It would have been just about the same thing because like I had the same hang-up on guy's got to be mine and this has got to be mine and that's got to be mine.</p> Yeah. I guess that ... I didn't think of that ... well, I did know that he was sometimes in his own way kind of mean to her. That's usually when she was around, like he would say things like, ""Oh, she's got a job,"" he wouldn't say anything bad about it, but he says, ""Yeah, she's a make-up representative,"" it's like Avon and that type of thing. He says, ""Yeah, well, it keeps her busy anyway,"" you know, like ... like it wasn't really something that he thought was important at all. Like she really couldn't do anything ... see they're both in their own way trying to get attention. It's not just her. Like he with his music, because he can play by ear, first thing he does is he wants everybody to get out there and listen to him with his music because this is something he can do. </p> Probably. It's probably ... that's true because if I just try to take it objectively, I can see that he's just about the same. They're both vying for attention. He feels hurt because the baby doesn't like him as well as her, and she can gloat because he does. And it's like, when I see that, then Robin is so smart, she's another one that's like in that type of a situation that's really sad and I can kind of feel for her because she's so darn smart and so darn sensitive and then Wendy is so darn selfish, and I didn't realize this before, but this is probably why she says things like, ""Oh my mommy doesn't love me"" and I noticed it when Robin got something like perfume, she got (ph) a little bottle. Wendy starts crying because ... and Robin's confirmation, she happened to get this perfume, and Wendy didn't get any, so she was crying about it. And then her mother turns around and rather than trying to explain it to her, my girlfriend Jodie had to explain the difference to Wendy afterwards. After she'd gone through the crying bit and the whole baloney, she just sat her down and said, ""Look ..."" You know, my sister gave her some perfume, which is ... it takes care of the need for the second, but the next time the same thing's going to happen, and you're going to have to do it for this one because you're doing ... And Jodie just sat her down and said, ""Look, if it was your birthday, would you expect everybody else to get presents?"" And she said, ""Well no, because it's my day."" The kid admitted it herself. And then she says, ""Well then why should it be any different when it's Robin's day?"" She just walked away, because she's a smart kid too. She's smart enough that even at six years old or five years old, to understand it if you sat her down and talked to her. [0:44:31.7]</p> Yeah. And it's like I'm really breaking away. My girlfriend said something pretty nice too on the way home. She said, ""Look, if you ever get in any kind of trouble, go to my mother. Don't go back to that place whatever you do!"" Because she could see what I had been living in, and I can see it more now, it's very funny, than even when I WAS living there, because it's a little bit removed from (inaudible) and I'm not used to that kind of thing anymore. And then with Jodie it was just doubly good because I could just sit back. This way, if I was quiet, I sat kind of back, I could see more what's going on. It was more over her than me this time. And I realized that the same thing had happened only I had been the object of it. And I thought, ""Oh Jesus, no wonder there's such a problem!"" And I don't know, it's just like, wow, my sister doesn't get straightened out, Jesus Christ! I really feel ... she's not happy, and I realized this too, like after a long time, I was never happy with myself, never. No matter what I had done, if I won some kind of a contest or whatever, like a shorthand ... we had an (inaudible) for law firm secretaries. And my one girlfriend walked out with Miss Law Firm Secretary of the Year and it was like tied for almost half an hour between her and I. [0:46:10.5]</p> Yeah. Not thinking that, ""Gee, that's pretty good to get the whole award for the shorthand."" No. Couldn't think that way. All I could think of was (mock crying) that I could have won the crown and I didn't get the crown. (both chuckle) So I'm no good. </p> Yeah. Yeah, it does. Then again, it was a nice night like this and I ended up being unhappy. And I thought ... I thought to myself, ""All this wasted day. Why be so unhappy with this?"" But it wasn't just the outside thing because I was unhappy with myself. I didn't really think that there was anything there worth being happy about. And it's still ... it's still hard at times. Sometimes I get depressed and I feel like I wished I hadn't been born a certain circumstances that I had been born in. Things like this. But on the whole, it's a little bit easier to accept. </p> You don't know what.</p> Yeah. I just sit there and go, ""Well I should do something, but what do I do?"" But one thing I realized too that I never got the training when I was at home ... because when I quit working out, I had to go in and talk to the head instructor. And I was thinking ... I really was thinking of doing it, it wasn't the idea that I wasn't, but I probably would have ended up NOT doing it if Jodie hadn't said, ""Look, you'd better get up there and tell him you're quitting."" I said, ""Well, okay."" So I went up there and I got him a card and the whole bit. And I was so ... I didn't realize how scared I was. I just remember myself all the way up there rehearsing in my mind what I was going to say to him and how I was going to put it so that he wouldn't reject me. I realize afterwards it was like so that he wouldn't really like turn on me and say (growling), ""Why did you change?"" or something like this because I go ""Whoa."" Or part of it too was like, how do I say it so that he doesn't feel like it's HIM that I quit for? So it was like two things. I didn't want to be hurt, yet I didn't want to hurt him either, because he was a good teacher. There was nothing wrong with his teaching. </p> I couldn't convey my idea the right way, yeah. And this is why I think all the way from work over there in the morning I had been thinking, ""How do I say it in the right words?"" </p> Yeah. See, I wanted to get so ... well partly, see I guess maybe partly because I wasn't completely honest. I mean, I'll have to be perfectly honest that there were some things in his teaching that I didn't like, the way he taught compared to the person. And that type of thing or like in a school or whatever you're going to, you have to use comparisons. And I like the discipline that my other teacher had, like he'd go (clapping sound) and everybody was down and watching. There weren't these people pushing you or getting in front of you and things like this to see him, and the sensei ... I found this out later on though that the instructor doesn't do this. It's just the way he inspires. He doesn't talk real loud or anything and people HAD to sit down and watch or they couldn't see what was going on. </p> And I didn't want him to know.</p> That wasn't the only reason. There were things like ... I don't know if it was running away, and it might be. Maybe this is partly the way I feel, like I'm doing better, maybe I'm not doing as much better as I thought I was, but it's like I didn't want to be in the same class, I didn't want to take it just once a week because if I just took it on Saturdays I would be like SORE for two days afterwards. So I wanted to take it twice a week or three times a week. But I couldn't because like they were on ... my two girlfriends were in the Monday and the Friday class. And I said I do NOT want to be in the class, I don't want to like feel myself or like feel inferior because like the fellows are paying more attention to the two of them or that like the teacher ... one teacher likes one girlfriend and the other teacher likes the other girlfriend. So you know, like, it's like, you would be there, you wouldn't have much attention paid to you or anything else. And I said, ""Look, I don't need this kind of thing."" And I WILL find myself doing that, saying, ""Well which one's for me? There's got to be somebody here for me."" [0:54:24.4]</p> Yeah.</p> Right. And it wasn't really my back. I didn't care. I was pretty good at the gym. I like working out. But I also like running, so there's no problem. I switched over and I like (inaudible), in fact, I think I like aikido a little bit better because it's not as rough. I do admit it was kind of rough. But otherwise, it's like most of it was to do with the human element. And it's just like I didn't like the idea of being put in competition all the time, because that's what more or less I'd have to do to get any attention. Let's face it, if somebody emotionally is involved with somebody else, they're going to end up spending more time with them and you're going to be pushed aside a little bit. And not that I liked him, in fact the funny thing is, is that I never did like that instructor as far as ... she thought he was so sexy and I kept looking at him and going, ""Okay ... I don't know what you see that's so sexy about him, but okay. If you say so."" (chuckling)</p> No, I would rather just have it ... like I would ride off into the sunset and nobody has to know anything.</p> Yeah.</p> Well I felt lots better after I had told him just for the fact that it IS very impolite. I had thought of taking a class because I still had one left out of the 25 that I had paid for already. And I was going to take it on a Saturday and then tell him. But the big thing was you see, my back was supposed to be bothering me. That back comes in handy for everything! You know, I came out for therapy because of my back, I get out from this because of my back! (chuckling) [0:56:10.1]</p> Yeah. It doesn't inspire me to go back because again, it's like they're talking to me, but like my girlfriend is very sexy, my girlfriend is very ... like lots of people really like her. But it's like I don't like the idea of walking into a class and everybody saying, ""Oh hi, how are you? OH, where's so-and-so? How is she? When is she having another party?"" And all ... you know, not like ""When are you two having another party?"" because I LIVE with her! And I was co-hostess of the last party. But it's just like ... I don't know. Or one of them said, ""When are you two having another party?"" and I said, ""Well I don't know, it depends on what dates Jodie can figure out too."" He says, ""Oh, well she runs all the plans? Well maybe I better talk to her."" Things like, you know, like ...</p> Yeah. That partly, and partly that I didn't like the way it was said, even at the time. You know, like, ""Well then maybe I'd better go talk to her as long as she makes all the plans."" Well she does make most of the plans for judo parties. And she does know these people lots better than I do. So like, when I said that, I just, I didn't mean that I don't do anything, I just meant that she usually decides the date of the party, whenever she's not busy and whenever everybody can come. And then it's fine. But I didn't like that, and I thought to myself, ""Well look, if I have to go through this all the time now and have to start PROVING myself that I'm ... like I can give and ... I'd still be competing with her because like people put us in the same categories too because we're roommates. Which is bad too, they seem to compare us. I've seen this. They don't compare Eliza and Jodie, but they seem to compare me and Jodie because we live together. And I said to myself, ""Oh Jesus, I don't need that kind of stuff. I'd be a lot better off just going out on my own.""</p> Yeah. And I mean it's fine, if they want to have a party or whatever, fine. I'll be there and I'll help out. And if I see these people just socially, that's fine too. Like we'll probably be going out Saturday night, my friends from running, my two friends, we'll probably go out Saturday night. But it's just like, it's a nice feeling to know that I can have my own friends and I don't have to fall back on her friends and sort of be like the extra, and that's the way I've always felt with her, you know, like, ""You're here because you're my roommate and it's a nice thing to be ... to do or whatever to help you out because you're such a poor little kitten, you can't get any of your own friends so like, here's some of mine."" I mean it's a nice thought of sharing, but it's like saying, ""Well, you can't get them any other way so ... (inaudible)""</p> Yeah. Right. Like for a long time I didn't realize that I used to think it was so nice and I couldn't understand why I felt almost again inferior because like naturally her friends would care more about her than me, even if I was ...</p> Well ... yeah, it would be like ... right. Right. Right, because if you're really close to somebody as a friend and you just meet somebody ... first of all you just meet somebody new that you've never met before, you can't really like them that much because you don't know them. So it would always make me feel that way, like ""Oh, s***, here I sit."" Sometimes somebody might be nice and say, ""Oh, how are you doing? Are you still with us? Oh that's good."" And then go back to talking to her. And it's just like ... and then I try to put on the big intellectual front so that at least I might look smart or something. Maybe then they'd look at me or talk to me. </p> Okay.</p>",2
1004824681.txt,"One thing that I've kind of noticed this week is that I feel kind of disconnected from—normally I would think of it as kind of feeling not in my body, except I'm very conscious of my body and things. I feel disconnected from how I'm feeling. When we've been talking it sort of feels like, not like I'm talking about someone else, but that there's a filter or a foggy window or something. [00:01:13] I thought it would go away but it hasn't and it was very frustrating. I was kind of thinking maybe it was just from calling my mom—like disassociate a little bit—or the election; but all of those things are over. Tonight it was weird. I kind of felt neutral about it. I kind of didn't get too into it until 8:00 or whatever. I just wasn't very engaged. I wasn't paying attention. I did have a brief freak-out when I called her about it but, other than that, I was just ""mehh"". I woke up this morning feeling very much like I wasn't sure if that all happened. I didn't feel connected to it. [00:02:29]</p> Everything that happened. The election stuff, yes; but I also felt like I didn't feel very connected to anything, like to what had happened this week. (pause) </p> It's global.</p> Yes.</p> Exactly. It's very much variable. It makes sense that it would be connected to my mom or connected to the election, but I'm out of dramatic events happening. This morning I went to see the specialist I'm seeing for my hip pain. She came in and sat down and she's like, ""Okay, so you're ready for the trigger-point injections?"" which she hadn't mentioned before. I don't like needles. I mean, no one likes needles, I don't like getting shots, but I had no emotion about it. I was just like, ""Oh, I didn't expect that."" I didn't feel nervous or worried or upset or anxious, I just felt like it was happening to someone else almost. (pause) [00:04:55] I don't know. It's definitely I don't find it incredible. Yes, it's totally snowing. No, no, no. It started around 2:30.</p> I was at a friend's house and we were kind of like, ""It's raining."" Then we went outside and we went, ""It's snow."" I wasn't happy about that. </p> About what I'm feeling? Stuff?</p> The other thing I was thinking about was that I work outside a library class and she's making us work in groups; but she had made us work in groups for all our previous assignments because she thought it would be helpful. And it's honestly only helpful if you live on campus or are a full-time student. If you're only on campus one day a week it's really irritating. So we had an extension on it because half the class was having a melt-down about it. Two people said they were in tears about what was going on in the assignment, so we had an exception. I haven't started it. I kept putting it out and I'm working with other people so usually that will get me to work on something if I don't want to screw over the other people I'm working with. [00:07:09]</p> No. Again, I just don't feel urgency or immediacy. I'm like, ""Ehh. There's a homework assignment due."" The thing is actually due next week. But I'm just kind of like, ""Ehh. That's happening."" I was going to work on it tonight but now they need me over at the school early. I'm going to sit in the library so I have less of an excuse to not work on it. I can procrastinate about homework like nobody's business, but usually I'm aware of that procrastination. (laughs) [00:08:07]</p> Yeah. I'm just like, ""Oh. I don't want to do this. I don't know what to do."" I'm just thinking about it and all the reasons why I can't do that because I have to mow the lawn. And I'm not really thinking about it. I was thinking about it last night mostly because a friend on Facebook said that she was having a hard time working on her homework since the election. I was like, ""Oh, yeah. I have homework that I should be doing."" Some of it is the reason that she wants us to work in groups is that the exception is none of us has ever done anything like it before—and I have, so I'm kind of like ""Mmm."" [ ] (inaudible at 00:08:57) assignment at work. Give it to someone else to work on this. That's weird. It's also like class 1:00—4:00 and then I have physical therapy until 7:30. I thought just because that was the only time I worked that hadn't stressed me out yet. I kind of realized that there are only two busses I can get home on, blah, blah, blah. I could take a cab. Today I went over to visit a friend of mine, Jersey. She has a prosthetic leg. She's not been wearing her leg and has only been in her wheelchair, so it's very hard for her to leave the house for the last week and a half. [00:10:14] I figured she was at home and I'd go over and hang out talking to her. I felt like pretty much into her and the conversation we were having, but still felt a little distracted. I enjoyed visiting her a lot. I always like seeing her, but this time I was also feeling like I wanted to go home and take a nap. ""I really want to ride home because it just started raining and I don't want to take two busses and walk."" Blah, blah, blah. The last half-hour of the visit I was just thinking and counting down wondering if she'd actually give me a ride so I could just get home and do whatever for a little bit. I was tired and I did take a 45-minute nap, but I didn't feel sleepy. I more just felt like I wanted to lie down for a little while, if that makes sense. [00:11:42] It wasn't like I wanted to fall asleep, it was that I wanted to not be doing anything. I didn't want to read or watch TV. (pause) [00:12:55]</p> Not really. I was thinking about what to make for dinner a little bit, because it's cold. Then I need to do the physical therapy exercises today, but that's kind of about it. The other thing I was thinking about was when I first got over to Jersey's and was talking to her, I was talking about the trouble the STI/STD class—how intense it is. It was a class about STDs.</p> Yes. It was really terrible. I was telling her about it but I also felt a little like I couldn't even joke a little bit, like I was over talking about it even though we were busily mocking it. The reason why it was so terrible is that it is something relatively new to the area, someone who Paige who has been looking and talking to grants groups to teach classes about STDs. She perched SMOB. She perched I think all the local groups. My friend and I were like, ""Let's go."" She's $25 per person for the class. Let's see what she's like as a [ ] (inaudible at 00:14:46). [I hope I have the time for] (ph) my two STD classes. But, whatever. The setup was crappy. It was at her house, which was a coop and people were still eating at the shared coop brunch/breakfast when we got there, which was confusing because I didn't know who were residents, who were people attending a class, if we were supposed to eat some of this food, like what was going on. They didn't really have seating. It was weird. It was one of those moments when she started rattling off her credentials. She was rattling off a bunch of medical procedures, among other things. She was like, ""Oh, I've done this and I've done cardio and I've done pap smears and I've done HIV testing,"" blah, blah, blah. [00:15:55]</p> I asked for clarity. I was like, ""That's a lot of things that you've done."" She really read off like 15 things.</p> Well, that was what I was thinking because I was wondering, ""Were you present? Were you arranging it? Did you do that?"" and she said no that she had performed paps and had done HIV tests. There is one type of HIV test you swab so anyone can swab. I just felt pretty sure you'd be a nurse or some other person like that, in which case you probably wouldn't be out of a job right now. Also what is your medical background? She said she's worked for the State of Michigan, she's worked for Maine but, again, it was kind of unclear like, ""Are you a counselor? Are you an educator? What are we doing?"" She started talking about herpes one and two like, ""Herpes one is really common. It's a cold sore. Most people have it."" I'm like, ""Yes, okay. I'm with you on this."" And then she was saying the State is stupid to try to not get Herpes one because everyone has cold sores and you can just get a cold sore. Blah, blah, blah. I'm like, ""I don't really agree. I'm not super concerned about it either, but it's a thing that you try to avoid."" [00:17:52] The next sentence was, ""The medical community isn't concerned about herpes, therefore none of us should be concerned about herpes one or two. Besides, they are both really common so there's no way to avoid getting one or two, so you might as well just accept that,"" which I definitely talk with people who are already paying for themselves that they're both really common. They're both really easy to transmit. Most people don't know if they have HSV two or one. I'm not concerned about it, which is fine for an individual to be saying that, but for an educator just a blanket statement, she didn't qualify it at all. She said it was the same as getting a cold and it's not. Then she was explaining that she doesn't tell people that she has HSV one but that she has cold sores because they freak out if she says she has herpes. I'm like, ""Well, okay, but you should maybe tell [ ] (inaudible at 00:19:10) that's misinformation."" At the rate she was talking she made it sound as if, ""You know if you don't want to get HSV two, you just have to wrap yourself in plastic and never make out with anyone ever again."" [ ] (inaudible at 00:19:31) I kind of pushed back and she, again, was like, ""No. It's just things."" I then went on to ask her about transmission rates because the way she was speaking, it sounded like if you make out with someone who has HSV one or two, that just happens instantly. She wouldn't answer my question. She had this long like, ""Medical studies are corrupt and people always lie about their sex lives,"" and on and on. I'm just like, ""Great. Okay, but I'm sure someone has some statistics somewhere."" She went on about it some more. What she was saying is that she doesn't feel that the studies actually have accurate information because people tend to lie about their sexual behavior which—sure—but they can say that much more concisely and there are still the statistics. [00:20:38] There is still information even if you think it's flawed. She spent 45 minutes talking about herpes and her end game was that it's just like having a cold, like if you have a cold you don't really know that you're infectious. Her point was about shedding (ph) like whether or not you're having an active outbreak. She was like, ""Well, you don't really know necessarily like when you have a cold you are contagious for two days before. You don't really know and maybe you go to some party and then you're like, 'Oh, shit. I have a cold,' and half the party caught a cold."" I was like, ""Yes, but, your herpes is for life. A cold is not."" She was like, ""Yeah, but [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:30) unless you're immune suppressed or pregnant."" Even if that were true, you can become immune suppressed at any time in your life and pregnancy happens. I think her class was supposed to be geared towards kinky people, towards queer people, towards [ ] (inaudible at 00:21:54) people. One of the things I was asking about was, ""This is not a typical population so, even if you're telling me the medical community in general isn't concerned about the average person's exposure to herpes, no one here has an average sex life."" Stuff like gay men are having crazy syphilis outbreaks that no one else is having, so gay men need to be more aware of that. Blah, blah, blah. It was great. The friend that came late ended up passing me a note saying, ""Do you want to leave early and get pedicures?"" [00:22:40] And we did, (laughs) which probably was [ ] (inaudible at 00:22:46). The class was such a shit show and I just had this sort of feeling of, ""I really hope everyone else in this room already knows something about STDs because, Jesus Christ."" Also she was giving this little STD pack to take home which had three condoms, as always, and a pamphlet from the government about BSM and safer sex. It was a really nice pamphlet and there was an unlabeled baggie with some wipes in it. I was like, ""What is this?"" She explained that they were antimicrobial wipes. I'm like, ""That you grabbed out of a big container and shoved in a baggie?"" That's disgusting. I don't want your creepy, used . . ."" I don't know. She was just like, ""Yeah, you can just take this and disinfect things with them—your choice."" So that was probably the most (chuckles) engaged and involved thing I was in really, and that was mostly because I was just like why are you telling me and all these people this information, which is crap and why did I pay money for it? [00:24:36]</p> Yeah, kind of. </p> Which is great. The other thing was that on Wednesday or Thursday Chet sent an e-mail to me and copied Harry saying, ""Some professor wants to do some live streaming of election coverage and show students how to capture video and everything. Are either of you available?"" I was like, ""Well, Chet, I'm not going to be at work. I'm on disability."" I was both pissed and kind of amazed/impressed. He has two full-time employees and . . . </p> Yeah, and he'd been flipping out about it. We talked about it the day before and he couldn't remember that. I was like (sigh). Part of me didn't feel mad as much as resigned. I'm like, ""Well, he's a sucky manager. Here's another example of that. Wow."" (pause) [00:26:32] But, yeah, the class did have that alternate reality that you can't argue with, except that the educator was really good at using language to make it seem like she was listening. Like, ""I really [ ] (inaudible at 00:26:55) on that question."" All of that. That's nice, at least. It's nice to hear some ""I"" statements and whatever because my workplace doesn't do that. She also was using them to appear like she was listening to my critique a lot more than she was. I was like, ""That's annoying, but I don't really care in the end because I don't have to deal with you. You're never going to speak at anything that I'm going to, probably. Somehow I doubt you're going to speak for any other group. P.S. you can get people to do this class for free and there are people in the area who will do it for money a lot better and have nice hand-outs and seating. She made sock puppets, HSV one and HSV two; but it didn't seem like the socks had been necessarily clean when she made them into sock puppets, which was also revolting. And the pamphlet from . . . [00:28:19]</p> Also the pamphlets from the government—the pages stuck together at two points and I'm confident that it's just my stirrer or whatever, but in that context I'm like, ""This is so disgusting.""</p> Exactly. You would have been better to throw those out because it's revolting. Also there's something about people casually eating on the floor that's just—I just felt like it was so very unsanitary.</p> Pretty much. And the seating was very uncomfortable. </p> And yet—I was there.</p> For 40 minutes. </p> Yeah. (pause) Because I have a lot of feelings about the topic. Theoretically, I don't think the idea of [harmoduction] (ph) when it comes to STDs is really interesting and amazing, </p> [harmoduction] (ph) So like Australia, one of their STD programs is basically like okay teenagers, you're going to have unprotected sex because you're teenagers, so oral sex is way less risky than vaginal sex. They've managed to reduce their STD transmission rate, especially for HIV by just [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:23) engage in unprotected oral sex. I'm like, ""That's awesome. You shouldn't have unprotected oral sex."" In theory it's amazing; in practice I'm just like, ""Don't do that. God."" Arggh. [00:30:39]</p> Yeah. I really like the idea of meeting people where they are and recognizing they're just not going to do that. [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:10) exchanges or encouraging people to have unprotected anal sex to use more lube so it's less likely to have tears by fingers—these are all amazing programs that I just have a really hard time with engaging in. With friends of mine who have unprotected oral sex I'm always like, ""Oh. That's a little—that's kind of risky. Maybe you shouldn't. You're an adult and it's less risky than other things than you could be doing."" Arggh. I always feel I don't want to be judgmental, but I am a little bit. I am glad they're having unprotected oral sex than unprotected anal sex. Arggh. So, yes. [00:32:19]</p> And it's about something I've thought about and am super conflicted on.</p> No, it does. And it pretty rapidly became to me asking her questions wasn't going to get me anywhere; and yet I was like, ""Well, but . . . stuff,"" and [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:51), which I think is pretty much a work pattern. I just like asking questions that are really dumb; trying to pursue things I'm pretty sure will not work. </p> Also there are situations where I've been to a lot of classes about sex where I disagree with everything that's happening here, but I just kind of disagree. I don't think this person is saying anything that is insane—not insane—dangerous, if that makes sense. When she went on about herpes I was just like, ""You're really encouraging people to not be concerned about it; and you're kind of encouraging people to not be fully honest with their partners or to pressure people into not using barriers."" [00:35:55]</p> Yeah, and seemed completely like she was that advocating people do that. To me, that is way more troubling than if it were a boring class.</p> If she had said, ""I'm personally not concerned about it,"" I would be like, ""All right. You don't have to be personally concerned about it""—but to say it for everyone? (pause) The other thing that is also somehow related is that I was thinking about travel. One of the things I always find very frustrating is when someone takes a devil's advocate position or their arguing position isn't really agreeing out of principle or—I don't even know—mostly devil's advocate. I find it super annoying for a variety of reasons, but also there is almost never a time when the devil's advocate position needs to be made. What I'm thinking about is someone talking about a personal situation and the other person is like, ""Well, let me just take the devil's advocate position and what if . . . "" forty bazillion things. I'm like, ""Well, okay. Sure. I guess this person could have suffered amnesia, but I'm not really sure that's relevant."" Like they take sort of a ""what if everything he said was wrong"" position. (both laugh) You know . . . I'm like, ""Hmmm."" [00:38:17]</p> Right. Yes. I feel like I don't know why you did that. I don't think it's interesting. It's not helpful, and I feel like they're telling me that I'm a crazy person. I've been thinking about it, in part, because of everyone talking about politics a lot and also my position I have with my friend, Zoe, where—I don't know what I called her about, but it was something I was upset about. She actually said she was going to take the devil's advocate position and I was like, ""What?"" Part of me thought it was basically like, ""What if you're wrong about everything?"" I was pissed; in part because she seemed to . . . ""Well what if you're just wrong?"" Also I was really upset and she didn't seem to be taking that seriously. [00:39:47]</p> I also feel like in political arguments, usually the person playing devil's advocate is in the position of power and they're trying to be like, ""Well, but the devil's advocate position—what if it's just awesome to most people or what if you just don't get rights or what if . . . "" I can't think of a good example, but like advocating for gay marriage—""The devil's advocate position . . . "" blah, blah, blah. ""What is the benefit to society of this?"" I don't really care. I've already thought of that and you seem to be acting the role of an asshole in this discussion and you acting as if you are an asshole versus you being an asshole are pretty much the same thing at that point, so I feel okay. (both laugh) I never do that. I know some people love doing that and it almost always pisses me off. [00:41:36]</p> I guess there are a lot of arrogant people at the university and some of them really love to argue and hear themselves talk. Some of the things I've heard as a student, I've heard around me at work at the school a bazillion times, and it just strikes me as kind of mean. I feel like the person who is taking the devil's advocate position doesn't acknowledge that their argument might—they aren't taking it personally so they didn't do this like a personal position. The person they're talking to might be taking this issue personally. Also they kind of act as though there's something wrong with you for having emotions regarding whatever issue. [00:43:39]</p> Yeah. It's like guys opinions on abortion. (sniggers) I don't really care. I'm speaking more about men who postulating about women's health. [I'm like honestly, I've actually done that, because you're not having a baby, so fuck off.] (ph) I was talking to several friends of mine who were unable to vote because of various like if [you're a person with syphilis] (ph) it really fucking sucks to vote even if, in theory, it's all [ ] (inaudible at 00:44:44) [ ], it's not. And if you're trans-gender, it can be all but impossible. </p> Yeah. Even if you don't have to present a . . . </p> To say your name and something in your name, usually a utility bill or whatever, and someone disagrees with your name . . . </p> Yeah. Exactly.</p> It would be nice, kind of.</p>",1
1000017868.txt,"...the stereo. Wakes you up, anyway. With that, oh, a funny thing happened to me last night. It was scary, though. I was standing in the ladies' room. I work two jobs and midnight. I work at night. I was standing in the ladies' room [all the ways] (ph) </p> Yeah. See, there's only like - they've broken through like - see, she had a different front to break through than I had. I don't even know exactly what breakthrough it is that I've got to break through.</p> Yes. Someplace like I haven't come yet. You know, and like - this was the way I tied the two things together is that I went into the washroom, and it shocked the heck out of me because like I'd never thought like this before. I mean in the higher - being really upset I might say something like, ""Jesus, I wish I was dead."" So then 'm very coldly sitting on the toilet and saying to myself, ""Well, if in six months I don't find out what the hell is wrong with me, you know... Like I don't care about the hurt, but if I know what's wrong with me so that I could remake my life,"" I said, ""I'm going to kill myself."" And I just thought of this very, very calmly and coolly and I was thinking different ways that I could do it that wouldn't be real bloody, because who wants to be bloody. I'm being a little dramatic, but not bloody. 0:05:01.7</p> You know, like the type of thing... And I put that together myself the other night. Last night when I got home I almost cracked up, because it was so funny like, within a week - not even a week, like four or five days - of the difference. You can say like you don't value life or anything, and then the next week, when it really, really comes right down to it, where you could be getting killed, it's a little different.</p> Oh, it was so funny. But anyway, that was really a nice party, except that, you know, I kind of felt like I wish they wouldn't have brought that up then, because I really felt badly afterwards. I mean we had a ball. We all got drunk and everything, you know. They had to go up and...</p> But they brought up, you know, like my problem. I didn't want them to. I mean like it was her party. And I felt like I kind of cheated her for at least a little while, but she got real emotional and she almost started crying after I was bawling all over the place. The other one was almost crying. This is her birthday party and they're bringing up my problems and you know, like everybody is getting all emotional. I didn't think it was right. 0:06:15.6</p> I didn't - yeah, partly that, and partly I wouldn't mind so much attention. It's the idea the height of attention. Like who wants you - like here you are, you go, ""Happy birthday,"" you know, boo-hoo-hoo, everybody is bawling. You know, like to me, that's not the way to celebrate a birthday, so I felt a little bit bad about that, you know. I felt nice that they both said, you know, ""Like we both care and we're both here if you need us,"" but I didn't like the idea of taking it on them. We could have brought it up some other time. But anyway, it was a pretty good party, laying around. They all got bombed (chuckling) and then we also get real goofy. 0:06:52.3 </p> Yeah, this is partly it. This is why I say probably singing would be a good thing for me, because it's something I could do for a long time and enjoy it, you know. It's not like typing; I can't stand it. I've been typing for years and I still can't stand it. Or other times that I like it is when I'm communicating with people, like when people come in and it's real nice, you know. Even if it is just to ask a fellow if he wants coffee or what does he want in his coffee or some stupid thing like this. It's just, you know, like then I'm communicating. It's like, say, ""Oh, my gosh. Here is another human being that I've never met before, and it's like a whole new experience,"" and that really intrigues me. 0:08:49.5</p> For putting it down on the report, you know, like a bad report on me. Whereas actually that was her job, I guess. But now, you know, the thing I didn't like either is like the next morning I came in and I was like five minutes late, and I'm usually like 10 or 15 if I'm late. And I came up with this one girl who the day before had just said she didn't get her bad report because she's never late, you know, and like I came up with her five minutes late and then she went right to the wash room. And I know her, like ten more minutes in the wash room before she even went to her desk, which meant she came in a quarter after 2. You know, and I said to myself, ""Hey, how come? You know, how come she didn't get it and I do?"" </p> You mean about the whole thing like with the office, what happened? Or are you just meaning...</p> I don't know (inaudible at 0:14:19.7) right now. I don't know. I thought sometimes when I start talking about something that's happened or that's happened to me, I get feelings about it afterwards. You know, like when I talk about it again, I sort of - I either understand why I did something - and then like this may have something to do with my basic problems, you know, that I try to get out. And I guess that's the only reason I say it personally, because I just come out, oooo (ph), whatever comes, you know, like I don't know what to say. And it's very hard for me to say like what I feel right now or whatever. But, see, like if I start talking about something sometimes I get into a feeling of some sort, like a rejection feeling or like everybody's picking at me, feeling the world doesn't love me feeling, that type of thing that - I don't know. 0:15:12.0</p> Come out, yeah.</p> What I said and what's going on and, you know... Sometimes I think, too, like - I sometimes feel like I'm railing (ph) from one thing to another and I don't understand what has triggered this other stuff. Because like I even thought of what I'm going to say before I come. It's just like I was thinking about last night, because I mean I was thinking about last night from last night to this morning and I'm thinking, ""Jesus, what would happen if I got killed?"" 0:16:11.0</p> Okay. Because like otherwise I wouldn't know. It's very hard for me to explain like how my life is right now or like what I feel, period, about life. It's too general, you know, to say like what I think my problem is or whatever; it's just too general. The only thing I can do is like say what's affected me, you know, and like sometimes maybe because of my feelings about it and my understanding of what's wrong. I don't know though. </p> I don't know, but like with my brother I feel very hurt mostly. Like every time - like when I went out there at Christmastime and I'd see this gorgeous stereo. I mean it's not like I wanted him to buy me a stereo. But it's the idea like he gives this girl who is not his sister, who is not any relationship to him, something that is expensive. A stereo is expensive. He doesn't make much more money than I do a month. He makes like - well, what do I make, about six? And plus a little extra, it's almost - it's like maybe 600 a month and then maybe a little extra typing and like that's it.</p> Yeah, right.</p> And he makes like 900 a month, yeah. So you know what I'm saying; it's proportionate; that like he makes either (ph) in a month or something like this. </p> Yes, because it's such an expensive gift comparatively to what he makes. And then like he gave her a watch for her birthday and all sorts of things, you know, or a clock radio, I don't know what sort of birthday... But I mean expensive things he gets her. Not even a card to his sister. I mean like that's not... All right, maybe because she's a young girl and her parents don't make all that much money and he'd like to get her something special. Even that I can condone, but not to even call me or take me out for a drink or do something, you know, like I'm his sister.</p> Nothing for me, you know. And it's like I sit there and I think, Jesus Christ, you know, I've got a brother and he doesn't even care about me, you know, and you're supposed to - you know, I guess then going right back to me. He's supposed to care because he's my brother, and I guess like you can't say that, because just because he's my brother doesn't mean he's supposed to care. 0:22:13.9</p> Well, you know, I bring stuff for Mary, too, and also for my other step sister, and like they're only my foster sisters, you know. And I feel myself I've only got one real brother, and he's really my brother. You know, I can say, ""This is my brother and he's really mine, you know,"" and I can say this because he is my blood brother. And then I say to myself, ""I can say it, but you know, like, big deal, you know."" It's kind of hard to say like - I think I said this before - I think it's kind of hard to say to somebody, you know, like ""My brother lives eight blocks from my house and I haven't seen him but maybe once since I've moved here and I've been here for eight months,"" you know, and people say, ""What do you mean eight months? You've got your own brother this close,"" all this bull. 0:23:02.1</p> Yeah. But sometimes - well, I do this with my girlfriend, too, and I know it. Like lots of times I'll say things like - see, part of it is like my girlfriend has got - and she admitted it, too, like Saturday. She said, ""All right, I guess it's hard to live with a girl who's got everything,"" and she does. I mean she's got like - any boyfriend she wants, any fellow she meets she wants, she can get; it's just like that, you know. And she's got like boyfriends that are rich and all sorts of things and they're real nice and they've got all sorts of plans and everything else and they take her to all the nicest places and she teaches and she makes all sorts of money and she's real smart and she's pretty and she's got like - plus she's nice. </p> Yes, right. Well, I mean when you've got a girl like that and you're living with her and people come over... And she shares her friends to a certain extent, but again, like she's got that insecurity about her father so she - it's like that far, and that's as far as you go. Otherwise, you're flirting or you're doing this and that. And like lots of times I know I'm not, you know. It's just like sometimes I just didn't know what to do. I didn't know like what the line is for politeness and things like when does it become a fellow is like - not taking advantage, but like getting too spoiled. I mean in the area of like when you come in, take his coat, when you get him a drink, make sure he's getting a drink. If he wants something to eat, ask him. You know, like whatever. You know, like I don't know how far to go in that area yet, because I just haven't been around that much. </p> Yeah, right.</p> Yeah. And then sometimes I have to sort of check, so I say like, ""Well, she's not so great. You know, like she's got balls, too. She's not so great. They're just dumb that they don't see them or whatever, you know. She's selfish, too, you know."" And then it doesn't make me feel so badly, you know, like because then when I compare myself with her I just say, ""Well, yeah, but look, you know, something like - what can I say? She's got a lot of self-worth and like - a lot of times she'll say like - well, she can be too much of a bitch and I really don't like... </p> Or at least an awful lot more perfect than I am. Like that came out Saturday, too. I said, ""Not a lot further advanced,"" or something like this. I said, ""A lot better than I am,"" And it sort of just came out, like I just blurted it out, ""Well, like I know you're a lot better than I am."" </p> Yeah.</p> It's partially me, because I've always been an independent. I've always been like a loner. Almost all my life I was like a loner. And then I guess partly it's because I really get to - finally found somebody like a friend, like I'd never had before, you know, like I was really kind of pretty close. And like I'd been through lots of things, like I improved a lot for help and this and that. But like I don't feel quite as - like I look back at myself two or three years ago, I think well, all my life I did improve a little bit, because I was really bad off.</p> I went over it, right, and it was like not only did I not want to be a loner any more, but I didn't like the way I was or who I was or what I was. And so I was trying to take on this, because I thought look what she's got, look at all these friends. It probably was a thing with me that I guess I really wanted friends, but I would never go out of my way to like be a friend or whatever you want to call it. Like I would never - I would always expect that people would come to me; it was like I expected that, you know, and I don't have to do anything, you come to me. It was a very selfish thing.</p> Yes, through her, and then what the idea was is then I thought, well, people really dig her because of what she does or what she is or whatever, so like I was trying to be like her. And then I thought, ""Well, you know, then people will dig me, too, or people will like me."" </p> Right, right. I guess I just didn't know; that was the big thing. I just never learned, you know, like how to communicate or whatever, or even to communicate enough of an emotion. I really can't explain it, but like it works sometimes even, partly because I don't care about the people, really. I don't care about that. There's not very many - there is like one girl in the whole office that I kind of like; I think she's a nice girl and we're fairly good friends, but like the rest of the people I couldn't care less about. You know, just the heck with you. 0:32:37.9</p> Right, right, that it was just anybody. Whoever was there, you know, ""Sorry, you've got it, you've had it, sit down, I want to talk."" </p> That's what it was, yeah, and it was like a selfish thing, that like I didn't let them share, either, like. Even if they started to talk a little bit it would just be like [shh, shh, shh, shh, shh] (ph), and I'd be talking again, you know. And I guess that came from like a long time ago, too, because like when I was at [White Hairs] (ph), when I was like lots younger, between, what, 9 and 12, I wouldn't talk hardly at all. I mean like I'd say whatever I had to say and I mumbled, I've always mumbled.</p> Right. And even at school like I didn't talk all that much, I don't think. I used to talk when like the teacher wasn't there, but mostly I was a reader. Like I would sit down and, boy, if I could sneak a novel or something behind a regular school book I'd do it and I'd be in there reading and I was always like that. Or I'd stay up until 2 in the morning and read by the hall light. That's why I'm wearing these. 0:34:17.6 </p> Yes, right.</p> Right, you know, and it's hard to learn, you know. And it's like when I'm relaxed and - let's see, how can I say it? - just me. And sometimes I really can't understand it. Like I've always liked the idea of people enjoying my company or whatever, you know. It's like, well, you want people to enjoy you, you like to be with people you enjoy, and you also like people to like you and have you around, and you like to say things that they like to hear type of thing. Not so much like I told a big story or something because somebody wanted to hear it, but it's like you like them to receive you well, you know, and whatever is important to you. 0:35:36.5 </p> Yeah. But when I'm like - I'm like uptight, I guess, because like I get really nervous, and I didn't realize how nervous until my girlfriend - like last night she said, ""You know, that I was sleeping and you woke me up,"" because I actually tremble at night sometimes. And I said, ""I didn't realize I was that nervous. I really didn't."" And she said, ""Honest to God, you just started to tremble. You scared the living daylights out of me."" I said, ""Oh, well, that's happened sometimes."" Like not exactly that, but like when I'm going to sleep at night sometimes, if I've had like a rough day, and especially if I haven't exercised, because I usually exercise before I go to bed, you know, and then by that time I'm not real - you know, it gets almost all the nervousness out of me. But like I'll go to relax and all of a sudden the body will just go like that, you know, like a little tremor, but she says I actually tremble, and I said, ""Geez, I didn't expect that much."" 0:37:02.7</p> That's a lot of nervousness is right. And things like - well, she says I do some goofy things, like I talk in my sleep about three nights a week. I said, ""Well, did I say? Anything interesting,"" you know? Like come on, maybe it's something to be important.</p> Yeah. I guess it's like - but most of it, you know, most of it is like because I'm thinking of me and I'm thinking about, you know, like how are they going to accept me. Like when I don't do that, when I just think like, ""Well, here is somebody new, you know, like let's explore"" or ""Here is somebody new, they seem very nice, you know, like let's..."" You know, that's it. And you think like of them or you get interested in what they're saying, and then you find yourself not nervous and being yourself. You know, like that's how I find myself. And again, this is a little bit new.</p> Yeah. See, because like always, when I was little or whatever, I can remember things like you had to watch what you were going to say. If you had company, make sure that you don't say the wrong thing and, you know, you've got to be... And that's the type of thing that I got to, like company or people you don't know you've got to be stiff with and you've got to impress them in a very good light. You've got to be very, you know... </p> Right, right, rather just being what I am, you know. I really tried really hard when I was with her. I know a lot of things, like I try to sound smart. I mean not smart-mouthed even, but like smart; like I'm intelligent, you know. Because this really bugged me, and like I think this has bugged me quite a while and I never realized it. </p> Yeah, right. I really felt like - like with judo (ph) people. Like we've got - I call them our friends, but they're not really my friends, they're Jodie's friends, you know. And like she says like three or four people have asked her for the house already and that. Well, all right, she's been with judo (ph) a lot longer than I have, but some of these girls started with me. And you know, I say to myself, ""Well, okay, so I've changed classes. They probably haven't seen me as much,"" which is true, which is maybe part of the reason. Maybe they just don't know me well enough. You know, like they might have seen her two or three times a week and then sure, they're going to ask her out within three or four weeks. But I just feel as if like it's because of something I haven't done or something I lack that people just don't like me.</p> Yeah, because they just don't like (cross talk) and I don't know why, you know. And it's really kind of a sad feeling, like. If I knew what was wrong - see, I've always been this way. Like she's even said, you know, she says, ""You've come a long way in two years."" If I know what's wrong I can correct it, or not wrong as per se, but like offensive or whatever you want to call it to like majority of people. I could change it. But if I don't know what's wrong, you know like I can't. It's like saying, well, maybe a skunk got me on the way down here and nobody wants to come here, you know, or nobody wants to talk to me. 0:41:35.8 </p> Yeah, right, right, or I feel like now my dowdy little personality is completely malnutritions (ph) or whatever you want to call it. Like I run out of material, so let's take somebody else's material to fill in, or there seems to be a lull. But see, like they really have been really nice to me. Like all right, one of the fellows that I did like likes my one girlfriend and the other fellow likes my other girlfriend, but I don't like him anyway.</p> For me, yeah, because they don't seem to. Well, you know, like I don't have the kind of personality like that she has, I just don't. Like, well, first of all, she can pull off a lot of these comebacks and then people will laugh at them. Well, what I do is they think of [you as sarcasm] (ph) or they think it's dumb. Not dumb, you know, dumb as opposed to being intelligent, but dumb as - not really dumb; dumb is the wrong word. How can I say it? It's like it's not natural. It's like an unnatural thing. And when it's unnatural it doesn't sound right for me, and I know it, but I still find myself escaping into it, because I just don't, like, have the confidence in that what I am is okay. 0:43:30.3 </p> Yeah. I wonder myself, you know, like, and when I try to get down to the basics they say, ""Look, we're all equal and we're all the same in certain areas that - you know, like we're all like - we're not really what we are here."" You know, like the mind isn't even the most important thing, the soul is, and that's even above the mind. And the soul is - and every person can be - I don't know, maybe it can be higher or lower than the other person, but it has nothing to do with how intelligent you are or how - I can't explain it. </p> When you get tired of the material, yeah. When you get tired of like the material, when you get down to the material level and then, shit, I have nothing, you know. Or I really can't say nothing, because I can look down and say ""Like look at these girls who do filing for a living and that's all they do all day long,"" and I think to myself, ""Well, they're not even going anywhere, they're not doing any schooling at night. They go home and watch the boob tube or whatever and that's like it."" And I think, well, I've come a lot further than they have, and yet, I'm not where I want to be, which really bugs me. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, or not even so much outside material things. Like all right, I admit a lot of times I don't dress as well as I should, you know, for what I do, and all right, so what, you know. Like sort of what - [that's probably] (ph) that's all I feel about it. But if I'm going to the other office, because like I do date the boss once in a while, I make sure I look real good and all this, because he really thinks I'm sharp, so I think ""Okay, great, you know. As long as I keep getting my money I don't care what you think."" </p> Yeah, this is it, because I don't think it and I know it. And this is why I say to myself, ""Oh, you're really a sharp girl, you're really..."" But he uses the word ""tough"" because he's from - like where the neighborhood he came from, that means the same thing, good looking or whatever. </p> Right, like nobody that I can even have some kind of a conversation with. You know, like emotionally, especially, they're really children. It is things like, ""Oh, I've got to go to the dance."" You know, like I don't know, they're just like kids. </p> Yes, and I just realized that. You know, like how am I doing? All I'm asking for his approval. Did I say that right? You know, and that's what just came across my mind, that I do that, like, with people. 0:50:32.6</p> Yes, or like, oh God, was that dumb, you know. Like ""Please don't, no, don't do that,"" you know. And it's just like I'm scared.</p> It's like - and I shouldn't be scared. This is stupid, but I...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, right, ""I guess that's what it is, because I really don't have the confidence to say, like, you know, ""I'm not dumb."" You know, that's really strange; I didn't realize that. But I must have really had like a conflict about that for a long time, because it couldn't just be like in the last two years that I really felt stupid, because I don't know why I would. The people I work with, nine-tenths of them, haven't had any college or anything else, and like they don't think half as clearly as I do, nine-tenths of them. Like there is one girl in the office, she was smart. 0:51:25.1</p> Yeah, that's what it is. Like I really feel - I should feel ignorant, because I am in lots of ways, this is fine, but I don't feel ignorant, I feel stupid, and that I don't like. Like if I won't catch something right away, I think, ""Oh boy, better not let anybody know that because they're going to think I'm dumb,"" you know. And it's really an important thing to me that I don't feel stupid, or that I do feel stupid and I don't want to.</p> Yeah, but that doesn't help me any. 0:52:03.3</p> My girlfriend will say that, too. Sometimes she'll say - like she'll come out with things like, all right, now I realize this type of thing like when - when you really have an inferiority complex about it, if somebody says something, especially if it's something you care about or something you trust or somebody like you know is this far and you're here, you know, like she said something to me like - this remark stuck in my mind that she said, ""Well, for above-average intelligence you certainly don't act it."" And I - uhhhh (ph). And I could feel like inside on my - like something in me just going shooooo (ph).</p> Yeah, right. And yet like when we were having this talk she said like, ""You don't have to bow to this guy,"" and I realized I had. Like my boss, like it was like he paid attention to me, so he must have seen something there. But it bugs me like when he'll say something like that, too. Like he'll say something about - he was on the phone and he said something about my mind. He said, ""Oh, should I call it that."" And you know, it was like I constantly found myself defending. ""Look,"" I said, ""just because I don't know anything about this I don't want to tackle this bookkeeping,"" because I was kind of na�ve in this way; like he was trying to set me up. He knew I couldn't do bookkeeping, but he knew if I did take this job - this other girl was setting the books up - but if I did take this job I'd have to be in late with him, asking him about it, and then he'd have the perfect setup, or he could say, ""Well, look what I did for you, now you do something for me,"" you know. </p> (Crying from 0:54:43.7 to 58:21.7)</p> All I can think of is say (ph) I don't want to go. I want my mama.</p> It's so like she went away and she would...</p> Every time I really wanted her she wasn't there. I remember crying for her one night and I was about 15 or 16. My step mother says, ""Oh, you're nuts. What are you crying for? Do you want me?"" And I says, ""No, I want my mother,"" and she thought I was crazy. She says, ""Stop being a (inaudible at 1:00:08.5) child.""</p> She couldn't help it but I still wanted her.</p> I was always crying alone, too. We were over at wagers (ph) sometimes and I didn't even know why but I cried. He always made fun of my crying.</p> That's why I don't think I ever wanted anybody close to me. (Crying)(Inaudible at 1:02:08.0) I says, ""Don't leave me.""</p> I says, ""What are we going to do this summer?"" They'd just both leave me and I'd do anything to myself, but it's time for other friends and it's time for this and this time we'll be able to have friends, but I knew I still live (ph) empty (inaudible at 1:02:33.2). I knew I couldn't keep on hearing it. It's silly and it's selfish, but they cared, they're the only ones that do, and my brother doesn't love me.</p> I don't even know whether my mother does. And my grandfather got so old (inaudible at 1:03:04.1) me. I remember that. I think he really loved me, but he died and I couldn't even go to see him; they wouldn't let me. They said he's got this big bandage on his head so you can't go see Grandpa. They did see Grandpa, but I couldn't see him and he died. 1:03:42.1</p> (Crying) Really was never afraid of me, either. Either that or that table (inaudible at 1:03:54.9) he might still be alive (crying). He was so good.</p> (Crying from 1:04:23.6 to 1:06:49.3)</p> I haven't even thought about my grandfather for a long time.</p> You know what I felt like? My brother was the one, too, that kept me from him, because I remember she told me, my dad didn't. She told me Grandpa was in the hospital and she didn't think he was going to live. So I remember I think I went and cried. I said, ""I want to see Grandpa."" </p> I used to (inaudible at 1:08:10.0) amusement park and we used to go there and have so much fun. I never got treats at our (inaudible), so I - there was an ice cream parlor downstairs. Every day he'd give us a dime and (inaudible at 1:08:25.3). Really the happy time I remember was my brother when I was there. He got the bubble gum all over his face and he laughed and laughed.</p> And Grandpa really loved me. I really think he loved me.</p> (Crying) (Inaudible).</p> (Crying from 1:10:00.8 to 1:11:01.1). I remember when we went to my grandpa's and he'd say, ""[I guess I'll tell you] (ph). We could just push two chairs together and you can sleep like that."" We used to laugh.</p> (Crying from 1:11:21.9 to 1:11:39.9). I remember, too, that he'd get a potty chair just for me, because he didn't want me walking out of the hall to go to the wash room and he didn't have one in his apartment. He didn't want me to go out there at night because he would wait (ph) for me, so he got that just for me.</p> (Crying).</p> (Crying from 1:12:32.4 to 1:15:59.0). </p> (Inaudible at 1:16:08.2). Then I remember when my father's brother died, and I think he was at the wake and like he didn't seem to feel anything. And I was crying and I just kind of felt like he didn't love Grandpa either, because I don't remember him going with us. My mother, my brother and me would go.</p> And my daddy didn't care about my grandpa. Why did he have to die? He seemed to love me when my daddy didn't and I don't know why.</p> But I always thought my grandpa went away only because he had to and it was his time to go. 1:18:07.6</p> But I don't think I ever felt like he left because he wanted to.</p> I know he really loved me.</p> Because I can remember my father saying that he was spoiling us, and I don't know what he said back, but I know it's something like he loved us and loved me. And he was the one - I didn't even care if he loved Ed, too, because I knew he loved me.</p> I don't understand why he'd care and they didn't. 1:20:22.4</p> I guess this way they might be able to care about me now, sort of like the payback, because I don't feel like anybody else did. But you're my brother so you've got to love me. You know, it's always like maybe because partly because of what he did when I felt like my mom did. Maybe that's why I feel like no one can love me or like me for me, because I feel like I must have done something, you know. Like people don't just not love you, because you naturally love human beings, unless there's some kind of like a monster; and like maybe I guess that's the way I always felt, like there was something wrong, because why would everybody go away? 1:21:22.3</p> This whole lifetime I realize my mom was sick and I guess that's why I never really - you know, I felt her because she was gone, but I felt like something like with my grandpa; that like she couldn't help it, she couldn't be there. Because she used to tell me she'd pray for me and she'd always think about me and everything. But you know, like I really didn't blame her until I found out there are lots of sicknesses in head. And the first thing I thought of is that I must have done something, because she didn't love me. She didn't want me there. She didn't want to take care of me. 1:22:07.2</p> I guess this is why, with fellows, I was so jealous, too, because like if they'd be flirting with another girl it would be like say like, well, whatever it is in you that you're lacking with it, I owe (ph) like, or whatever this girl's got and you don't have it, and I guess that's why I felt so jealous. Because like, you know, I felt like there's something there that just keeps people from me. You know, like - I mean like dumb people. Even if I were real dumb - I know I'm not real dumb, but like if I was real dumb, like people love dumb people, too, you know. Like you don't have to always be saying something that's real smart or like - like I've been to Europe or I've been here or, you know, like there's lots of people that are just nice, and you know, like I feel like that I must not even be nice because nobody wants me. 1:23:38.6</p> And you know, like why? What could a 7-year-old do that was so awful that her parents wouldn't love her? You know, like I was never really all that bad. You know, like I wasn't even that old yet and I was outside playing all day long or in the school, and I wasn't even that bad in school; I had average marks. I didn't try, but I had average marks. I never had - like call me to the principal or anything. Like, you know, why didn't they love me? Why was I so awful, you know, like - and I'd just think (ph) ""Why, what did I do? Why doesn't my mother love me?"" 1:24:30.6</p> Then she said, ""Well, I don't want you to be sent to any crummy place, I want you to go to Springfield because that's where I was. And she told me about what it was those nuns did to her when she was in that nice place. She broke a dish or something, but the nun didn't like her and beat her until she was black and blue, and that's a nice place and she wanted to send me, you know. And I don't know if I even realized it until after I was there, and I kept thinking to myself, this is the nice place? 1:25:30.2 </p> And then I had to leave again, and it was just like - I don't know. I felt like, again, I did something wrong, you know.</p> Yeah, and that's just the way it was. It was like, you know, ""You're shipping me up. Either you leave or I go,"" you know. And it's just like I know like relationships of any kind can't be like that. Like people are going to die or people are going to, you know, move or people are going to do whatever they're going to do. Or like - here I was, I said to myself, ""I'm so stupid, you know, sometimes,"" because like I don't want people to stay around me all the time. </p> Yeah, and it's like...</p> Yes, I think that's what really was down the basic of it, because like that's what really - I felt like my mother. I felt like I did something wrong because my mother doesn't love me, you know. And like I felt like - like with my grandpa; I couldn't even go to him, and I felt like I should be there, you know. It's like Grandpa loved me. Okay, so Grandpa's dying, he's leaving and he doesn't want to leave but he has to, and they wouldn't even let me say goodbye to him. (Crying) I couldn't even tell him I loved him, you know, and then... </p> I knew he wanted to see me. I knew he did, I could just feel it, and they wouldn't let me see him and say goodbye to him. I remember asking my mommy ""Please, Mommy, please, I just want to see him one more time, Mommy, please,"" and she wouldn't let me. </p> I couldn't talk to... I really - I just wanted to say goodbye and I love you. That's all I wanted to say to my grandpa. I knew he was going to die; I knew what that was already.</p> Never realized how much that hurt me, that she wouldn't let me see him.</p> What hurts more is I know she didn't do it purposely. You know, it's just like she didn't know. She didn't know how I felt, and like maybe I just couldn't tell her. You know, like maybe what I said was like maybe a stubborn brat or something like ""I wanna, I wanna, I wanna,"" and she just thought it was like something else that I wanna, wanna, wanted, and it wasn't like the way I really felt.</p> I did remember telling her I wanted to see Grandpa, because I don't even know if I even told her I wanted to say goodbye to him. But I do know I said, ""I want to see Grandpa, I want to see Grandpa,"" and she wouldn't let me see him. You know, like all right, she thinks it is kind of a spoiled kid talking, but that was a kid who wanted her Grandpa.</p> Then like I know she's insecure, too, and like I know I probably got part of that from her, too, because like I remember her saying like that's one of the reasons she didn't see - I felt kind of bad, too, because like I felt like I needed a mother. Even if it wasn't my own mother, I needed a mother. And like I felt like she didn't want me in a foster home right away. I don't know if she told me this or what. Like she'd say, like, when I finally did get into foster home, like, ""You're going to love her more than me,"" or ""Do you love her more than me,"" or something like this. </p> Yeah. And then like I felt kind of drawn to her, because she was kind of like my mother, Mrs. Foley, but I don't know what happened. I really just don't know. Like all of a sudden like I just turned away from her, more or less. It was like - I can't really explain it. I don't know whether it was like one time she got mad at me and she said she hated me or what it was. You know, like it was just something that I had done as a mistake and then it just sort of built and built and built. </p> Yeah. That happened when I'd get somebody who I could semi-trust with - like I didn't know I had all these hang-ups like with, you know, changing around from here to there. I didn't think it bothered me, and I never thought about my grandfather, I really didn't. It's just like pushed down; I just didn't want to think about it, because he was gone.</p> And he was like the only one. Like I mean I shouldn't say ""never did."" Like my mother showed me a picture of when we were at the beach. And I like said, ""Oh, that was us."" And I said, ""Oh, is that North Dakota with Grandpa?"" You know, I guess the first thing that came to my mind. But like it didn't really bother me, because like I guess partly because the only thing I remember right then was like the basic - like there was a happy time, and so like that was it; like I didn't go deep enough, because I didn't want to. I didn't want to say, like, you know, ""I love my grandpa,"" and, you know, you wouldn't - again, she wouldn't let me go to him. And I think - I don't know. Maybe when I was having that daydream it wasn't Daddy I was running to, it might have been Grandpa. 1:36:54.3</p> And he was there. And I always felt like he was - I guess I felt like he was there. Like we only saw him every year or something. We'd go up there for two weeks or a week and we'd go to see him, but he was just so, so good, you know? And it was just like what an image. Like who could even live up to him? I don't think my dad even lived up to the image I had of my grandfather. I don't know whether he really was that great, but like to me he was God, you know. 1:37:24.7</p> It was always grandpa this - I guess. I don't know, I feel like it was. I know my mother says I really thought a lot of my grandpa and that I really loved him a lot. She could tell. Like we were up there, we have fun and everything, but I don't know. It's just like when I got older it got so hard to show any kind of affection to anybody or any kind of real emotion or to feel it. You know, like I feel it coming up, and I think part of my problem, I think I actually push people away. It's like I don't want you to get close to me because I know you're going to leave me, and if I get to like you then you're going to hurt me and I don't want you to hurt me, you know. And it's like I'm really afraid. I'm afraid to let go.</p> See, but that's it. It's really hard. It was actually hard. I had to sit myself down for about three days before and prepare myself. Now look, this is what you're going to do. I don't think I could have done it at that party otherwise. It took me like three days to convince myself that now you're going to just think about other people. You're not going to care about yourself. Just forget about yourself. Think about them, make sure that they're happy, and then just make sure everybody is dancing and nobody's left out, see.</p> Yeah, and make sure... But see, the funny thing was is I sort of replaced it with a positive attitude, like say like ""Don't worry about it,"" you know. ""Take the initiative yourself. You see somebody sitting down and they don't have a drink or they're not dancing or whatever, you get them up and get them dancing. You do it. Don't be sitting back and say 'nobody wants me,' you know, like yet or whatever."" And I found I really had fun. I could say at that party I really had fun. 1:39:18.1</p> Yeah, see, that's the thing. The thing is to get over that, to say that, you know, like ""All right, so that's the way it was, but it's not like that any more,"" you know. Like ""There are people in the world that do love you.""</p> Yeah, but it's hard.</p> It's hard to say, because then - see, but then there's like guys - my life right now. You know, like I don't know about Seth. Like Seth's got a problem with his wife and I'm getting him to talk about it, like I tried to tell him, ""Look, Seth, first of all, I like this other guy in the office; he's real nice. Will.</p> Well, I don't know. Do you have to go?</p> Okay. I'd like to work it wait (ph). I just feel like, oh, the hell with it, but I don't know. I just - I meet people like Maurie that in - and that's my boss, and he - I don't know. He's just - I used to think he was so nice because like he paid attention to me and everything, and it was like I think the attention that I wanted from my father, because he was an older man and he used to... You know, when he first started out it was things like he just touched my shoulder or he held my hand and he took my hand and he held it, and it was just so warm and nice, you know. 1:41:13.0</p> Yeah, right. It was like making a world that I wanted to be there. You know, it was like saying, ""Now this is this and I'm glad,"" you know, and then not really looking and seeing. 1:42:19.5</p> Yeah, partly that, and I needed something that was like - yeah, partly that. It was like a projection. Because he said like he was the one that saved me from being fired. I think he's full of bull, too, but like I believed him. I wanted to believe him, see. Logically I'm a good secretary. I'm not a great secretary, but I'm a good secretary. And you know, I've got a good working rapport with people, and like that's something that most secretaries don't have. Like every client that comes in compliments them on me, not because, you know - not because of looks or anything like that, but because I know how to handle people, you know, and they like that. 1:43:51.4</p> Yes, I think that's true. I want to be able to say something like - I say to myself, ""Who's out there?"" I don't know who she is. She's some typical - well, I shouldn't say typical, no. Just from my background I'm not really what you call typical, but you know, like maybe starting out lower, middle class and maybe ending up middle class. Wow. Like, boy, I really went places, didn't I? And I just don't feel like I've done anything. I know it's because like, see, I like to get too much at once, partly. 1:46:34.1</p> It's just like, see, I feel maybe because I felt like I never had anything at all. Like I just felt like nobody cared, nobody wanted me...</p> Yeah. And now I have to do all this myself because like nobody cares. So the only way to do it... And then I say to myself, you know, sometimes they're (ph) so stupid, because if you start caring more about other people, like our drill instructor is getting a friend of his own the apartments in Toyko. They're going to get an apartment for my girlfriend when they go there. And you know, like it is things like if you're more concerned with other people, like lots of times it makes your life easier, because they help you out. But see, I'm always afraid that they're not going to do it, because like I've done that before. I've been real nice and what happens? Choom (ph), somebody turns around and just stabs you in the back, and so what do you do, you know? You don't know, like, how far to go or what to do.</p> Me, too, what's left of me. Better try to get to the train and get back to work. Now I understand what my girlfriend means, anyway. Thank you.</p> [She didn't even] (ph) fogged off my glasses. I'll see you next week.</p>",2
1000061054.txt,"Oh, no. I'm not supposed to chew. I have a temporary-a bridge for one tooth that I had put on last week and I was chewing gum and it came loose. So I had to go to my dentist for a special trip and he re-glued it. It was terrible because it was stuck all over my tooth before I went in. I decided to give up gum.</p> Well, with my friends, I guess pretty good. I've still been talking to them. Everything's been at a pretty rapid pace. I guess it's getting more rapid because of moving now. I don't know, I just-I think right now I've become closer to my friends than I am my family. </p> Lately, I've just felt like I couldn't talk to my two sisters that are around. This one girlfriend of mine-I just felt much closer to her and everything.</p> I called her up the other night-we were talking-and I called her up. After we hat started our conversation, I told her but... I think now-or you've at least gotten the idea that from what I said that I kind of panic when something changes. And I was just thinking about how I was relating to my two sisters and I was talking to my girlfriend and she said something that kind of calmed me down. She said ""You need different people at certain times"". I really can't even put it in the right words. She said you just need people at different times-other people. So, I wasn't worried about it too much.</p> Well I felt bad. I was hoping it wouldn't be a lasting thing, you know? But I think with one of my sisters-there's this-I don't know. We're changing and we're both just going in complete opposite directions and the only reason I think I can talk to her sometimes is because she's my sister. But I really don't like the things she says or she does. </p> No, she's just really insensitive to everything. Really, she is. I mean, she's a good person but she just-I think she's mainly interested in her life and her thing. But I don't know.</p> Yeah, I can talk to them about much more things than I can talk to my sisters about.</p> I think it must be something with my whole family because my mother-the other day she called and she said ""Why don't you and Adrian come over and stay overnight?"" and she had already planned what she-she would meet us downtown and everything and I just-she said everything so fast and I kind of had to think what I had planned for that day and everything. And I said ""Well, I'll call you back later on in the evening or else tomorrow"" and she-I guess she got hurt because I didn't say we'd come out right away. But I don't know, I talked to her later. She's-she's super-sensitive, you know? I asked-I told my sister about it and she said not to even think twice about it because she does the same thing to her. But I just felt like my mother and my father were pressuring me again, running my life, when she did that little thing. </p> Yeah, she just gets hurt if you say ""No"" or ""I'll call back tomorrow.""</p> You know what she did? She sent me some money in the mail then yesterday. I don't know if she did it because she had extra money or she just-I don't know why she did it but I felt twice as bad because here I get this money in the mail today and everything.</p> I don't know, because...</p> ...she gave me some money over the weekend which would usually be enough for the whole week. Then to have her send me some.... What day is it? Tuesday already? I don't know. I was just kind of wondering if she was doing it to make me feel bad or what.</p> Yeah. </p> (chuckles)</p> I don't know...</p> I don't think she was trying to get me upset but I-you know, the more I think about it, I really don't know. I just kind of feel bad because she's there with my father and he's virtually impossible to live with. He's-I really feel sorry because she lives with him now alone and everything so I guess she has friends her age but they can't get together, you know, (inaudible 05:59) so I guess she looks forward to seeing us. I don't know, I just kind of feel pulled around. </p> Maybe just Adrian, I think. Because when Adrian is there he just fills up everybody's time and maybe she-she has him now, so....</p> I don't know. She likes to see Adrian, but I just feel bad again because she gets so tired from playing with him a lot. And she won't-she won't say she's really tired. She says she loves to do it for the baby and everything, but she won't say she's tired when she can't take it anymore.</p> So I have to kind of say ""I'm going to go now"" because of that.</p> Yeah, well she's kind of like a real big martyr at things like that. I mean, I think she does it to my other sisters, too.</p> Yeah. I feel bad she has to do it because she is the martyr type.</p> I'm afraid of hurting her.</p> Yeah, because she's hurt all the time. I mean, I see my mom-she's in the middle of-she's a punching bag, too because her parents are still alive and they're old and they think about themselves a lot and they want her to do all these things for them and just react towards them. And my dad is there and my sisters and I just kind of think she's-I don't know. I think we come to her when we want something done, actually, or we want her to-I don't know-just...</p> Well, good and bad, I'd say. Sometimes I think she does too much.</p> Because she's-you know, like she's had four kids. Something I've told her before, like her whole life is centered around the mother role and the kids. </p> I told her last week because she's always-you know, she gets herself mixed up. She calls herself mom because we call her mom. So she said to Adrian, ""Come to Mommy"", like that, she says ""I mean, Grandma."" I said ""It's okay, you can say Mommy to him, I won't mind."" But she made special point then after that to say Grandma. My dad will tell her once in awhile, ""You're the grandmother, not the mother."" I don't care. She can be called Mom or whatever she wants-like certain things I don't want Adrian to learn about or know. And when she does it I kind of reprimand her right away. I don't know if it's in a loud voice or what, but I kind of-my dad reminds me every once in awhile. He says ""Don't hurt her feelings"" and stuff. He says ""I'll tell her.""</p> Tell her what I think she shouldn't have done and what was bothering me in that situation. </p> Just certain things-like once-I think I told you before-she-Adrian was looking at a little doll, a plastic doll or something, and she grabbed it right away and she said ""Boys aren't supposed to play with dolls"" and she put it-she hid it and he wanted to see it. And I said ""Well, let him just look at it to see what it is. That doesn't mean he's going to play with or take it home."" So she's going to have to adjust to having a boy in the family, a little boy in the family. I don't know-another thing is she bought-no, she didn't buy it-she found this plastic gun in the house and she was just going over to Adrian ""Bang, bang."" I didn't want him to play with guns or anything, you know? Because it's also-it's got the paint, the silver stuff that comes off real easily and I didn't want him to suck on that or anything. So I told her to put that away. </p> Well, I'm not too sure. She kind of-well I think my mother is pretty liberal as far as we go. Anything that she says, like, I guess, about morality or just what girls should do and what boys do I think is kind of-she's heard it so much from my father, she's picked it up from him.</p> I mean as far as playing with certain toys. Well it wouldn't apply to our age, but what girls are supposed to do like, like get married and keep house and that type of thing. </p> Well they-she might-they don't bug me too much about that right now. I think it's like my older sister because she's teaching-she's married but she's still teaching and they think, for example, that she should give up her job and just have a baby with her husband and everything. Because my dad always says in the end she'll just have a little red schoolhouse. They've been married, I guess, four or five years. So my dad said it's not right for her to teach as long as she has. You know, most couples after they've been married a few years have a baby and everything. So I guess...</p> Her? Oh, I-yeah-I think she should do what she wants. For God's sake, it's her life. And, I've told her. She's seen me and Adrian and I said ""Heck, it's a twenty-four hour job. It's just as hard as teaching at school. You get paid for what you do"" and everything, so you can't-my father's like that, though, he tells us everything. He told my sister what career he thought she should have, what I should have, you know my other sisters. He just doesn't tolerate any of the-any different lifestyle and his. Like I told you before, he wasn't brought up that way, either, so it's something new that he found.</p> And he thinks that we should stick with it because anything that he has or what he's worked for to give us is the best way. </p> I told you-because he and my mom, you know, life centered around the kids because they each came from a very small family so I guess they missed a lot, too. Then they came and had four kids and they did everything for-saved up money for college and all that stuff and they just figured that the way they were living was the best possible way and that we should live that way, too.</p> Not when I speak about it, but when I actually live and try to put up with it that way, it's harder. It's harder that way. But it's getting easier for me.</p> Well, maybe because maybe my father's way is pretty good, you know, having all that security and everything and maybe it's a guilt because they did work so hard.</p> Yeah, but I-but I don't feel-like I don't have all those things in life to back me up right now and he's not going to give it to me tomorrow. Like he has the bonds and all that type of thing that when he's dead, you know, in his will, we get it. Big deal, our lives will be half over anyway and I don't know, I just-it's really not that important when you're young unless you're a very practical, conservative type person, you know. </p> Yeah.</p> Because my father if-okay, he backs everything with a very practical, reasonable scheme. He just-he just wouldn't go for anything that was on impulse or anything like that because he's in his fifties and he's just not used to it, I guess. Like he always answers, he says ""Well, you're young. When get older you'll feel differently."" And maybe I will. </p> I don't know. I think about it like if you have to go to the hospital or anything like that. I don't know, things are just getting so out of line and out of proportion as far as money goes anyways, today.</p> Yeah, I suppose you could have enough but then you might spend it foolishly. I know that I could have enough, say a certain amount. But I guess if you have more than you really need, you start buying things that just are luxuries. I know that if I had more than I needed I probably wouldn't save-I'd buy a few of the things that are necessary like insurance or something like that or hospital insurance. Probably just want to have a good time with the rest. </p> No, I don't think it's possible for me right now.</p> Because I find more and more that I really dislike handling money, period, because I've heard so much about it from when I was younger and I-I just hate people who quarrel about it and that type of thing. I mean, as long as I have enough to be comfortable and everything, I wouldn't-I don't think I'd really care about it.</p> I don't. When I don't have money, Diane, when I don't have money I'm much better off and happier than when I have it and I have to worry about all my-I have to spend it and everything. It's true. </p> If I ever had enough money, I'd probably have some accountant take care of all my financial-and also when I meet somebody new-say like, you know, when I was-a couple years ago if I'd go out on a date or something and the boy was an economics major or he had a summer job or something with money, it just-I just-turned me off for the rest of the evening and to him, period. </p> You know-I-well, I don't even like to use that word, materialistic, but just more that I don't see the dollar signs with a lot of green stuff in it. It's like my dad used to argue over every dollar with my mother and everything. </p> (inaudible20:27).</p> He just downright insults anything different from his. I mean, it's not just-it's anybody else that's... It's strange because my three other sisters have extreme attitudes on money, too. My younger sister, the one right after me, she spends it like water. The youngest one, she's really like a tightwad and I think the only practical one is my older sister. She just has an even balance on that. Maybe we were all affected by that. </p> Well, the only...</p> It's true. You know, like-money, for example, say if we-if my whole family went on a trip or something and the bill would come to a thousand dollars or something else like that and my dad would pay it all at once and say ""See when you save what you have"" or something like that. He never realizes he's wrong-he really doesn't.</p> I did?</p> I think everybody just lets him argue and says what he wants and then goes and does what she wants. It's the only way, I suppose.</p> Probably say I'm not handling the money right. Yeah, I think my father just likes to gripe. </p> Well I just-I still feel disappointed because I know, say, for example, if we're arguing I know that I'm right and I have all this stuff to back it up and he still won't give in. It's disappointing because I know that I was right but I've learned that he's just going to keep on and everything. What the heck. I don't know. I think I was the only one in my family who used to argue with him about it, because my other sisters just knew then, when they were younger, what I know now. That he does want something to gripe about so it's just no use to even fight back.</p> Yes, he says ""You're young. What do you know?"" </p> Well, I don't know. I tell everybody that Adrian and I are growing together but my dad, he comes every once in a while and he says ""You're twenty-five years old. You should have some responsibility now"" and stuff like that. He says ""Show some brains and do that right"" and I still think he thinks deep down-he knows that-or he thinks he's the one that's always right. [24:47]</p> Or he thinks that I still don't know, you know, you should take some res-respon...</p> I don't know, he probab-I don't know-I think-I don't know if it has anything to do with faith at all. It just has to do with he's the father, he's the man, you know?</p> No, I just-I was just saying that I think was my father's case that he was the only man in the family, you know, the father and everything. No, because it's strange that my older sister married a guy who can't even take care of money or anything like that or the bills. He just throws everything all in a lump.</p> Financial? </p> I was just thinking about it. I guess in a way, though, she's happy. I mean cooking and taking care of the kids and everything. Because she's a very homemaker-y type.</p> Yeah, but I-just with a little more-I don't know what word-but a little more respect or sympathy, I think, from my father. [27:54]</p> Well, she works-she helps my dad two or three times a week. She's a Librarian-he's a Professor. So she helps him in the office but I mean still she's taking the orders from him again-fixing stock or organizing shelves or something like that. And she says she'd rather stay home and cook and that type of thing than work in the office.</p> Yeah, I think she would because she's not-my dad's not at home at lot of time.</p> Yeah. But I think she likes being home much better.</p> What?</p> Well, yeah, she always says that my father drives her crazy and everything and I'd believe it, too, because my father, he drives me crazy.</p> Oh, really. He's good at a lot of times and everything. But he's just one of those men that are very domineering and very energetic and everything and you admire them from a distance if you don't have to live with them. If you have to live with them it's another story. They're miserable. But, yeah, she always makes comments that she's glad he's at the office or something like that. He always-my dad always-seriously, I think he says to my mom when he retires that they're going to get a one and a half room apartment and live together in that. My mother says she'd kill herself first because he would drive her crazy.</p> I think he did it to save money or something. I don't think he was doing it specifically to be closer to her. Because he has all these things to keep him busy and stuff but he likes to have my mom around to cook him something to eat out of a clear blue sky because he eats at odd hours. He just wants a slave is the best label, I guess.</p> Yeah, because she really depends on him, you know, because he doesn't pay her at the office. I mean he gives her the money for the regular stuff but she doesn't have any money, really, of her own. She can't really go out to work because she has-her leg is stiff. She had an operation. She had arthritis and it was stiffened because the joint was taken out. So it's really hard for her to be on her feet for a long time. In that way, she's pretty dependent on my dad. </p> Yeah, because he lets you know that you're dependent upon him and that nobody else would do it.</p> I think she does more than enough to be thankful and to deserve it.</p> Yeah.</p> Really an ideal marriage (laughs). [32:13]</p> You know, I really haven't seen any. I've never really seen one that I thought was really attractive.</p> Well, I don't-no I don't-I don't really-well I feel like Robert, Adrian and I are family but I don't feel like I'm his wife, you know, or I'm married to him. Although, maybe I'd feel married to him, but I don't feel like I'm-you know, like I wouldn't call myself his wife or I'm sure-I don't think he'd call-or I'd call him my husband. (inaudible 33:06) said that to me once and it bothered me because she said-I don't know-she'd say-she said ""After all, you're his wife"" and I said ""I'm not his wife"" like that. But I think of us as a family but not really-but not really like the standard or old fashioned type family.</p> Just, you know, people together. </p> I don't know. I think mainly because of my parents and their marriage. I think I'm really afraid to get married.</p> Because like, you know, I've-I haven't seen a marriage that's really lasted twenty years that's really happy. I mean, some of the stories my mom tells about her married friends in the suburbs and stuff it's really like a freak show. The things that happen, you know, you don't even see that in the movies the things that happen. You know, it's really something else.</p> Because more than anything, I think I'd want my marriage to work. I'd want it to be-not exciting every minute, but really a live type thing. Not really just something that's there and not really taken for granted.</p> Yeah.</p> They're awful things?</p> I think it's true for a lot of people because the minute you start pinning down words and asking for definitions and-I don't want to sound like I'm a hip person or something but it's true-I've always disliked red tape, you know, things that consume time or just a lot of paperwork and things that don't really get down to the brass tacks and stuff and I don't know, I don't think it's really important to a lot of people to say that ""Oh, he's my husband and I'm his wife"" and everything and just come across as a family and just relate to each other really well. </p> Yeah, because if you're doing something, you know. Say, if you're even making a dress and you're going along and you're doing it, you're enjoying it and then say the minute someone else comes in and gets technical about it, I don't think you enjoy it half as much.</p> I think it's-maybe it's too hard for me. I can't cope with it to try t have all these experiences and to try and label and explain it, too. Because...</p> No, well the minute I start doing it I-then I have to go back and think about it and then I-you know-then I start thinking about all the things. It just isn't as nice as before and it just sort of messes up the feeling for me. I've always been like that, Diane, but I haven't been able to realize it to explain it until just recently.</p> Yeah, because, like, like, I think you've gathered from all the sessions so far that the minute I start going over something-well, I think it's true of everybody-just gets more reaction to it and you're not fully sure how it felt in the first place. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, but actually I don't think I like to talk about it either way. You know, the other, the other way out there. Although I think about it an awful lot, I have to admit.</p> I think about it in my mind-like just like-the situation I think when I came in here the first time I was just over-thinking about, over-intellectualizing about all this stuff.</p> No. Like I just worry about putting everything into categories, too. When I think-in all reality I don't even... Like in school I even hated to pull out all those cards. You know, thirteen sets of cards or whatever it was.</p> Yeah, because, I think-that must-I don't know-stem from my laziness, you know? </p> Possibly because like I told you before, I don't really feel secure about my own-my thinking and everything.</p> Because no matter what it is, there's always these other people adding their two cents or influencing it in some way.</p> Well it-not so much as before but kind of. I mean, like my sisters and I would always say things to kind of irritate and egg my father on. You know, sit there and kind of giggle. I think he knew it, too, that we were just getting him stirred up but he'd go on because he likes to shout and speak his mind and everything.</p> Because we're used to it. He'd just drum it in our heads so long that even if you're not paying attention you hear it because he's go this sort of voice. Everything he says he repeats at least four or five times. I'm not kidding. </p> My mother's starting to do it. She finally picked it up from him, so it's really bad. </p> And everything that my mom or dad did, I mean, is a complete opposite. Like when my sisters-we only say something once. I don't know if we're really doing it on purpose, checking it ourselves. I think it's something deep inside us know. We only say it once. We never repeat things to people unless they ask.</p> I don't know-but-I don't-yeah-well, I don't know if its really a reaction against him. I think it's just being in contact with a different type of people and feeling more comfortable with them. But I don'-I guess it is also just getting away from my parents there.</p> It's a lot of (inaudible 43:37).</p> Because my father was just so formal about everything. He wanted the table set perfectly every dinnertime and he wanted all these big family conferences. I don't know, stupid stuff, you know, once a week or something family conference. It was like he was running a corporation almost and everything.</p> It's kind of funny now. I always said that I was going to write a book about my family. But at the time it was really hard to live with. And everybody laughs when I tell them these stories but it was really bad. [44:19]</p> One thing that always got me, you know, my father would say ""Let's all sit down and have a nice big meal like a normal family"" and you see all these families where you live, they don't sit down to a ten-course meal. The kids are all bopping in and out picking up sandwiches and stuff like that or ask can they be excused. And my father he's expecting us to sit there through all the whole meal and have desert and say grace at the end or whatever. You know, just talk about things that happened (chuckles) to us during the day and that wasn't just-that wasn't normal.</p> What?</p> Today? (chuckles)</p> Yeah. And all our friends were outside after meals getting back on the street ready to play ball again and stuff. My father has pulled tricks like having the table re-set and everything because we all didn't come down or we all didn't eat at the same time.</p> What do you mean ""What do I mean?""</p> And, you know, my sister or somebody would say they weren't coming down or say they were out and they called and said they'd be late. Half of the kids would want to eat and so they'd eat anyways and my dad would have a fit and my sister would come home or something and he'd tell my mother to re-set the table and get the food on again.</p> Yeah, you know. He really pressed that stuff.</p> Well, I mean when you're there at the time, it's insane to re-set the whole table. It's really-and we had to sit through it and-(inaudible 46:40).</p> (inaudible 46:48). My father's word for anybody who isn't normal and decent, he calls them a pagan (laughs). Dad's really-he's really a character. Everybody else, though in the town and the Temple and everything they'd all admire him and think he's such a wonderful man and everything. They always told my father ""I bet with five girls you never get into the bathroom to use a mirror"" and everything. We were thinking to ourselves ""Oh, God, he's the first one in there."" He has it the whole half-hour before we got up and we're all upstairs in the other bathroom. </p> Is a what?</p> Yeah, people who aren't moral and everything like that. Or who even drink. Not even alcoholics, but just people who drink, period. You know, an after-dinner drink or something.</p> Yeah. Well my dad used to be really wild when he was younger. He was. He was all over Europe. My grandmother never knew where he was. He was always calling and writing for money and stuff and he-now he doesn't remember it. He-no, it wasn't so. </p> Yeah, that's for sure. [48:39]</p> Well actually my dad was such a nut about everything that nobody would want to talk to him anymore. He just like took all the spontan-spontinuity-whatever it is out...</p> ...of everything and, you know, we'd just-I don't know.</p> Yeah, we'd just sit there through all that drudgery and just make simple, crummy conversation with him.</p> Because he wouldn't have liked what we did anyways if we even told him. So, we'd sit there and say ""Aw, nothing, we didn't do anything all day"" or we read a book or something.</p> Yeah, and like he's not even tolerant of-he's really bright. He knows all about history and he's got Master's and everything and stuff like that. Now, he just has narrowed down his interests in music and stuff to just one thing. He doesn't even like to listen to anything else. It's really a shame because he is so smart and everything and he just-if he were just natural about it, there would be so many things that we could talk to him about.</p> Yeah.</p> I'm just-I don't know. He just doesn't know how to relax and let himself go. I mean, even on vacation he wears a suit (laughs). I don't know what his problem... It's really-it's sad because he's in his fifties, too and I want my mom and dad to have a good time and to enjoy themselves and they just don't. I don't know why. </p> Like he complains about people so much. He doesn't like this or that about them. It's gotten so that even his friends-there's no more friends, they're just dwindling. </p> Yeah, because he always finds something he doesn't like about them or something's wrong. And everybody he likes everybody else thinks is crazy.</p> Well, he doesn't think he's unhappy, though. But, I don't know, I just think his life is pretty, you know, yuck.</p> It's hard, though, I don't think we'll really know the truth about him from his life when he was younger. Everybody says something different, but I have a feeling his parents kind of drove him really hard. Just really made him feel bad about a lot of things and, I don't know, I think they just made him feel...</p> Possibly. I don't really know. But...</p> Well I think the thing that has helped me a little bit more is I do have three sisters. I know that I'm not alone as far as my parents go and I know that my reactions to them aren't really far out because my sisters feel the same way. </p> Yeah, and I have them for a security type thing whereas my father just had these two people drilling him all the time. He was, like you said, kind of locked in because he wasn't able to get outside opinions or anything. </p> Like, even if I was locked in, there were three other girls in there with me, so we were able to...</p> It is. You know, thinking about it now, I can very easily see how one person alone with two parents could really be intimidated and everything.</p> Yeah, just...</p> And I think also in my case that it was just other people I knew that kind of helped me along. They said your parents aren't a hundred percent right and that type of thing.</p> I think the (inaudible 55:06) happened at a good time, too, I think. Going away to college like one, for example, was a good thing.</p> I went to a couple places. I started out at Loyola in Education and then I dropped that and I transferred to a girls' school, (inaudible 55:24) and I changed my whole program to English and Journalism. But and I think just going to the east coast was something else because everything, you know-the lifestyles and just words that they use are so different out there. </p> But I was able to travel back and forth. My first boyfriend was in Massachusetts and he was one of the biggest helps as far as helping me become a separate thing from my parents, you know, because he was kind of going through the same thing with his parents. So just, you know, that whole thing with (inaudible 56:12) bringing him to school helped an awful lot.</p>",1

I need to be at the  store tomorrow for a little bit, so I think it might be better if I just skip.</p> I need to be, like, I think it might be easier just in general just...</p> Yeah, I think so.</p> I think that just right now, I think that it might not be any...</p> In order to be on my game, I need to do some stuff that morning.</p> And that's OK, that's OK.

I just (pause) I really need the downtime in other ways, even though...</p> If you have anything that opens up on Thursday or Friday let me know, but for now, I think I really do need the downtime.</p> OK, just let me know.</p> It was actually a part of the exhaustion thing that I've been thinking about this. I am considering trying to find a way to pay to see a geriatric specialist, (inaudible at 01:43) weight loss technically, it (inaudible at 01:44) the phrase over at the hospital, because at this point I'm just really frustrated. I have the data to show that I am getting an awful lot of exercise, I'm gaining weight like crazy, I'm taking in very minimal amounts of food. There's no reason—and I'm exhausted. I mean, I am flipping exhausted all the time. And so, all this, like, stuff that you're supposed to be doing, like, I'm not even on steroids right now, so it's like, you know. And I got, like, real good valid data, like, GPS tracking data to show that I've been, like, walking around, you know, several miles a day, those kinds of things.</p> Yeah, it's a lot of pressure to my joints. That's probably more than half of it, but then it's, like, (inaudible at 03:51), it's partially, like, actually being startled every time I see myself in the mirror, you know? Like, I'm just sick of it. Really sick of it. And I'm just getting so angry because I'm doing all the right things and I'm not getting what I'm supposed to be getting out of this. And, you know, I would love to talk to them and say, you know, I've looked into this, I've been doing things, you know, like, I'm taking less time (inaudible at 04:16), you know, I've done these glycemic things so that—the worst part is, every single day this week I've come home from work and immediately gone to bed.</p> I take a picture of everything I've eaten. Like you said, for years, I've been eating (inaudible at 05:16) because it helps my stomach. 90 calories, you know. This is not, like, I'm not, like, waking up in the middle of the night and eating food, because we don't have it, you know. There are people that, like, you know. Yes, I know that people are very non-objective about this kind of thing, but I'm not. I'm really not. I'm not yelling at you, I'm just yelling at life.</p> And I have experienced more and more people in my life that are more and more petty about it and, you know, I'm just sick of it. I'm really sick of it. (sighs) And it feels just the one thing I can control, you know. I should be able to control. I mean, I am, you know, when speaking to a couple of people that I know closer to me about this, you know, I've had friends make jokes that I would have an eating disorder if I wasn't actually overweight, you know. Like, because I throw up a lot from not, like, from stress. Or not like a lot, but there are periods of time where I have thrown up more than a few times in a week, you know. [00:06:30]</p> Stress, I think it's from stress.</p> Yeah. Well, I mean, it depends. Right now not, because I'm not taking the stuff that makes me nauseated. But I think it's stress, you know. I haven't in over a week, but it's not like a binge-purge kind of thing. It's not even really like I make a—sometimes I make a conscious decision, but most of the time it's like a, you know, my stomach is extremely nauseated kind of thing, you know. And (pause) I'm kind of getting afraid to go to the dentist because of that. And, you know, it's just, like, I'm just freaking sick of all of this, you know. And I'm just...</p> Yeah, I feel like I should be able to vaguely control at least part of this kind of thing, you know, but I can't. And it's making me so damn angry. So, I actually—I sort of avoid finding a new gynecologist even, because I'm officially at the weight right now where my birth control doesn't work anymore. They (inaudible at 07:43) for that. And therefore, I get that great talk about that too and, you know, it's like, oh god, you know. Like, I'm sick and tired of having conversations about my weight, I really am, you know. So (pause), like I said, it's really frustrating. It's frustrating because I'm exhausted all the time too.</p> Yeah. So, like...</p> It's just, like, it's a lot worse, yeah.</p> Well, I apparently accidentally—and part of it's my fault, I guess. (pause)</p> Well, according to him, I sort of accidentally triggered him into looking at pornography.</p> OK, so I was looking at a picture. It was a hand drawn picture, and I was making a comment about the fact that this is supposedly supposed to be—first, I made a joke about it being porn. It wasn't actually—it's very cute, endearing, two people in a bathtub. And I said, ""You know, the only thing I'm looking at is this bathtub because I am obsessed with, like""—I'm like, there are two people naked in a bathtub. You really don't see anything anyways. It's a cute little drawing. And all I could do is think of myself as going, ""Wow, I really want that bathtub,"" and I keep staring at the bathtub. And I keep telling him about this and, like, how I keep coming back and obsessing over the bathtub, because my bathtub's crap. And I keep looking at this bathtub.</p> For example, whatever we at (inaudible at 12:26), when I worked for my old company, there used to be, like, all kinds of brochures and stuff like that, and it was referred to as missile porn. Because they have this, like, layout, like this pullout thing. It's like a, yeah, like a centerfold. And things like that. And so I got, like, and I mentioned...</p> Exactly. And I'd gotten—especially because, you know, I'd been strongly involved in a fraternity and this, and I always lived in a male-driven life. And so, I've gotten very desensitized. And it isn't like I went out of my way necessarily to act like the boys, but it was just sort of a second nature thing to me. It never really bothered me. And so, yeah, so every time these phrases like this (inaudible at 13:15), you know, I just made a joke like, ""I'm totally looking at this picture and it's pornographic."" You know, (inaudible at 13:19) it's porn but [I was just] (ph) looking at the bathtub. It's not porn, it's two people in a bathtub, like playing with a rubber ducky. It's drawn, it's cartoon. Yeah, there's no body parts showing. But I'm making a joke about this and I'm like, I keep staring at the bathtub, wishing I had a bathtub like this. And apparently, that kind of...</p> (laughter) Can I get that on tape? (laughter)</p> Yeah, and that's actually far more, like, illicit than that kind of thing.</p> And it's...</p> It wasn't like this was a blame thing. He just wanted to say, ""Hey, you know, the way you were talking about that really triggered me and, you know, I just wanted to let you know that, because I ended up accidentally using it."" And it wasn't like a look-what-you-did thing. I said, oh my gosh, how amazingly insensitive of me. I shouldn't call something like this actually porn when it's not, you know. I should've said it's a cute picture of two people in a bathtub. I just belittle that kind of stuff, you know. I just do that (inaudible at 14:31), you know. And (pause) it just sort of (pause)—you know, the funny thing is that usually I don't have this much trouble with it. It depends on what groups of friends I'm around, but I tend to not usually have a problem with making, like, comments like that, but I guess I've been thinking—it just changes my behavioral habits. Just like going to therapy here has made me swear a lot more, which has actually given me slightly a problem. Because apparently, like, I'm, like, swearing a lot more, like, on days that I come home. Luckily, it's not before work, but, you know, it's just (pause)—I'm a chameleon when it comes to speech patterns and things like that.</p> I don't know where I'm getting it from. Maybe I'm just getting used to it, I don't know, because I only usually swear when I'm around my fraternity brothers. At work, that's sort of, like, the role I play as the goody two shoes who finds, like, words to say about people that are even funnier than the actual swear words. Or occasionally, we've made up new swear words. Like, we totally tried to make zune into a swear word. Like, we totally tried to, like, turned it into shit or fuck or something like that. That didn't really work, but....</p> But we've been trying to do a galaxy too, occasionally. But, you know, it's like I'm definitely—and this is something I've been, like, all my life. I am a lot more of a chameleon. But at, like, work, although some people do swear, it's just sort of a persona I put on as the person who says something funnier than actually anything that you can actually say in terms of actual swear words. But, you know, and it's just like, you know, I don't know why, but I guess it's just because I've just made some—oh yeah, now I kind of know. But the point was I've been very lax with my speaking about things. And, like, it would've never been a big thing at all for making a joke about, like, you know, making a joke about something like that being, you know, calling it porn but not really being porn. And I even showed him the picture. He's like, ""Yeah, that's not porn. Like, that looks like it was done by, like, you know, the special tender woman's dolls. Like, it's like cutsies (ph)...""</p> Yeah, yeah. Well, he didn't see the picture at the time, but I totally was not. But the point though is using the word was very, you know. And he even admitted that it wasn't really him, but it was something that set it off and that was all something. But I still feel like maybe I am being disrespectful on some level to his struggles right now, you know? And yeah. So, that's, like, you know, that's, like, really frustrating. And so that makes it a lot harder, you know. He just shuts down. Like, I don't know what the hell he's doing right now. I don't necessarily know all the time he's—he (inaudible at 17:39) upset about, like, eleven days of sobriety, but, like, at this point in my life right now I don't necessarily disseminate that the pornographic use with the video game playing that much anymore. Because the same thing, it's like this obsessive, like—I'm trying to remember the word that we talked about using this. He becomes very disassociated afterwards. If he's been playing—I actually have seen this with other people, these long term turn-based games like Civilization, after playing 12 hours of it, you're disassociated because you've been playing 12 hours of Civilization, which is unfortunately not all that strange in my world (inaudible at 18:21). But they get kind of, like, spacey and not really altogether there either. You know, kind of...</p> I don't necessarily know. It's not bad. It's not nearly as bad, but it is definitely—there's a little bit of a personality change, but I can't ever—that's one of the few things he has fun left in his life, so I'm not going to be, like, raining on his parade about that.</p> No, I hope not. I don't know. Probably not that long, but I could see three or four hours. Like, the amount that, like, to me seems like inordinately long, you know, but, you know, it depends. I mean, and the thing is there's a difference between social gaming and, like, you know, that kind of thing where there's, like, a bunch of people together and everyone's sort of part of what's going on, but you're—it's kind of a social activity. And doing this kind of stuff forever. But to me, actually what bothers me more is the fact that when he does this that because we are broke, he has been stealing and that he pirates a lot of the stuff.</p> The games themselves. And me being, like, the only person on the planet who really cares about this, I don't know, but I programmed for a living at one point in my life and I am hardly—I don't care what they say about sim buyers having enough money—he doesn't justify any of that, by the way—I think it's wrong and on top of it, I think it opens up a whole window to things that are much worse. Because once you start getting these programs that are hacked so they can do this, there are other things that come along with it, you know. Trojan horse type stuff.</p> Yeah. (inaudible at 20:11) play them when you don't have the disk, the software that allows you to do that or, you know, there's a lot of things that open up the gate for that. And on top of it, these type of websites have very unsavory practices in general that we've had problems with. So it's like, yeah. I just feel like—and this is—I hate being one of those people that's very black and white in this though, but I really feel like it's, like, the easiest way not to, like, have these troubles is just never to go there. Just like the easiest way not to have, like—and you know, things in life, by playing by the rules for the most part. Not everything's fair, but for the most part you're going to get mostly a clean break on it, you know? You don't steal, you (inaudible at 21:00) in jail, you know, that kind of thing. Well, although some people do. I mean, these are, like, these are the super super small, like, outliers when, you know, innocent people have these things happen to them.</p> [inaudible]?</p> [inaudible], yeah.</p> Yeah, she stood us up two weeks ago. And boy, that was hard. It was a friend of mines, it wasn't me though. But yeah, so, like, I deal with a lot of different people and I know what is and is not secretive computer behavior, and he still doesn't believe me on this. Like, doing a lot of the full screen things, have a million windows that you swap between, like, you know, having this, this, this and this open, but you can only see one thing at a time, like, and being, like, it's very secretive.</p> It's more than that actually. It's more like (pause) I don't even know how to explain. It's like, OK, if somebody had, like, their windows, like, tin-foiled over, it would seem a little bit suspicious, you know what I mean?</p> That kind of thing. Or all of a sudden someone put up these ten foot, like, fences that you can't see through? That's kind of weird, you know? And at first, it became like, ""Oh, you only work for the elderly."" No, I teach a lot of video editing. I deal with a lot of people and they're not that, like, shady about this. And I tried to explain to him that the (inaudible at 23:28) and he think he's started getting it now, sort of, that all of the secretive behavior is leading to the, like, addiction, you know? He doesn't see it that way though. The problem is he doesn't—and I hate—I don't want to be the policeman, but there is nobody else who sees this except for me. And so it's like, yeah, like, nobody would know in the world that he disassociates (ph) if it wasn't for me, because I'm the only person that sees it. Or the playing the games about being at one, like, location instead of another one? And at the same time, it becomes like a, ""Well, Debra must be exaggerating this kind of stuff."" No, no not really, you know. [00:24:07]</p> Yeah, it's like it happened to somebody else. He, I mean, regularly, he doesn't have a memory from one minute to the other so, like, this is pretty, you know. And (pause) I don't know. That makes it easier...</p> I used to get really, really angry that they were not being—because they're all claiming that they really want to help with his recovery, they want to be really, like, forthcoming, but they're not telling me what's going on. I realize they just didn't fucking notice. Like, if there's nothing to tell, because they didn't know. Like, they didn't pay attention enough to know, which is just as bad. You know, like saying...</p> Like, not being (inaudible at 26:27) notice because obviously (inaudible at 26:29) noticed was, you know...</p> In the same, it's not like the mother who goes out partying. She's in the same freaking house, sometimes in the same freaking room. And that doesn't, you know, she just didn't care. There is actually something else that I hadn't really thought about in a long time, but makes me believe something even more to that. About the time that we got married, Mike had to get a copy of his birth certificate so he could get a passport. And (inaudible at 27:03) we had to get it, and the first time there was a passport that was just ""white baby male"" and, like, we thought it was kind of strange.</p> Yeah. And that's it, along with a couple of other things. And then we called them. They're like, ""Oh, this is wrong, you know, let's send out this new one."" I am starting to think that they didn't name him for a while.</p> Because apparently I guess back a long time ago, you could actually leave the hospital with a birth certificate that was just ""white baby male."" So, I mean, this was not like a they typed it up—this was, like, a photocopy, and then they sent me a new photocopy. So I'm starting to think that they didn't name. I know that they called him ""the baby,"" well, OK. I mentioned for a long time that I was totally blowing things out of proportion by saying that they called it ""that baby."" It's actually ""the baby"" instead of ""that baby,"" because that's a totally different thing to say, by the way. Completely different. There's, like, extra bells and everything.</p> Yeah, and not always dysfunctional either. To most people, it would seem like he's a lot more functional. But, like, he has an amazing sense of empathy, you know. He always thinks of other people first, you know, and this and that, and (pause) yeah, you know. And so many people that know him would never ever guess, but also not just never guess, but wouldn't believe me if I told them. Not because I try to be cruel....</p> that's just not the person that they know. And that they would, just because they know who I am, they would take it into account, but it would be very hard for him because it's a different person completely. And it's just so (pause)—it's so hard, because I love him so much. I just don't love the addict, you know. [00:36:00] And (pause), you know, we're trying to make it, you know. And as the holidays come up it becomes a lot harder. We're trying really hard to find real traditions to have that—because his family doesn't have a whole lot of tradition. Most of the traditions they have revolves around ladiness (ph). I thought that the reason why they put the Christmas tree up on Christmas Eve is because, like, everyone's there and it's a Christmas tradition. He told me, he's like, ""Yeah, it's just because my mom didn't want to really bother with, like,"" he's like, ""having to go up to the attic and get it till, like, Christmas Eve came around then it became kind of depressing without a tree."" That's like, OK, great, you know. [00:37:03]</p> Yeah. The worst part is having them say that they are so on board for helping him and they care so much, but they really don't give a fuck. If they gave a fuck, they would've helped him get into innovation therapy a long time ago. He had an actual therapist had everybody come into the office and said, ""He's probably not going to get better unless we send him off to rehab."" That's more less what they said. And everyone sort of looked at each other saying, ""Oh, well I hope he gets the money,"" you know. And (pause) at this point, maybe I am ridiculous but I feel like they did this to him, they should undo it, you know. We can't afford it—if we could afford it, it would be a different story. Not everyone call shell out, like, you know... [00:39:29]</p> Extremely expensive. And, you know (sighs) (pause) we all sort of a little bit admit to this kind of stuff. Like, oh yeah, I wasn't really all that, like, helpful with being around, like, to understand Mike or, like, this and—you know, they're all sort of skirting around whether or not this way, you know, responsibility, but why doesn't anybody just man up and say, ""Damn it, I'm sorry, you know. No one was around to make sure that you got taken care of it."" Or damn it, ""I'm sorry. When, you know, you were supposed to be coming to visit me for the week because it's my weekend as a dad, you know, and I let you stay closed in the room with a video game all the time. But, you know, I really should have taken you out and engaged you and, like, had some conversation,"" you know. [00:40:32]</p> Yeah, pretty much. It's so weird. For a long time I blamed me because it seemed like—well, I saw, like, they stopped doing when they met me. Because they had paid for, you know, private school, you know, this and that, you know. It looked like—at least from my point of view, it's like as soon as I came into his life, they just gave up. But it looks like it was just easier to (inaudible at 41:22), you know what I mean. Not easier, but (pause) it looks like he went out of his way to find a way to make it easier to go to private school, you know. Because his best friend was going there they (inaudible at 41:36) whatsoever. There's no reason why you never go to judgment (ph) school, but his best friend was going there so he found out that there was, like, a test he could sit for a potentially get, you know, a scholarship and—like, it wasn't all free, but it was definitely a lot more affordable and, you know, and things like that. But it was not as obvious to me at that time, for a long time. So it looked like took care of him, they fed him, they put him through, like, a relatively good education and as soon as I came around—like, this is why I have the same blaming thing, like, there's something wrong with me. And they were more than willing to make sure that that was totally helped (ph) along the way, you know.</p> Sounds good.</p> Sounds good.</p> OK, sounds great.</p> [You do the same] (ph).</p>",0
1004532456.txt,"Hello, sorry I'm late; don't want to talk about it.</p> Yeah. Excuse me while I catch my breath.</p> Yeah, everything is going good. Kind of had a blow up with my girlfriend on Sunday. It was her (inaudible at 00:34) this weekend. And we went over to her aunt's house. And I don't know if I mentioned before, but my girlfriend and my... and her mother don't really get along too well. They kind of have... they have issues. Her mother has Lupus, another one of her mother's sisters has Lupus. And then her aunt... her other aunt is bipolar and there's another aunt that's an alcoholic.</p> No, I know that. But for right now in my head, I think it is.</p> Uh-huh.</p> I don't know. I wish I knew. Because I'm kind of feeling that guilt again. Because I - yesterday when I came home from school - and I was at my parent's house last night. And my mother is talking to my aunt, who owns the restaurant. And she's talking about how she can't do this, she can't do that. Telling me how they don't have the staff anybody anymore. Everybody wants these days off, this day off, they can't work. This that and the other thing. And part of me is saying, ""Good, I'm glad they're finally getting this."" And the other part is saying, ""Well, I mean, I should work, why don't I go work?"" And I'm... I'm kind of getting torn because my aunt has to have surgery at the end of the month for her knee because she can't walk anymore. And that's the guilt that's coming in is because I am around, I am available. Why am I not... why am I not working? And then when I talked with my sister, she's like, ""You're doing the right thing."" And talking to my girlfriend, ""You're doing the right thing. You need to end that relationship, not... not on a personal level, but on a working level."" [16:22]</p> To my girlfriend and my sister?</p> No, I don't. Because I know in my head it's the right thing. But again, the emotion part is eating me. It's eating at me where I don't like to see them. It's kind of in a way, I could - my old job in insurance, Okay? That company burned to the ground and they bailed and everybody quit and did all that. I could have no problem with that. But me having emotional and a family relationship to the restaurant, I want them to fail, but I don't. Because knowing if I could help prevent them from failing, I want to in my mind and in my heart. But physically and mentally, I don't want to be involved in it. I've just been through way too much there.</p> They were dependable, exactly. They were... they were what I needed. And then I'd got in the mindset, it was like... so I couldn't work without them. I couldn't go there without them. And in a way since I've worked there sober, it's been a real, real struggle. Because when it does get tough and when I do get frustrated, I do want to turn to alcohol. I do want to turn back to drugs. I think that's why I turn to the marijuana. Was because the marijuana and like I told my... my girlfriend last... when I was doing it, it sounds like it helps me clear my mind from it. It helps relax me. And I... and I guess she didn't understand it until now a little bit. But I do have different ways of hiding my emotions, of covering up what I'm really feeling. [21:00]</p> It does.</p> It does. Because I know how serious it can get. I know because of those choices and putting yourself in those situations like the ones I was in. Accept I took it too far. I know what - I don't want to say I can see worst-case scenario coming her... worst-case scenario coming out from her. But in a way I kind of lived out her worst-case scenario where I overdosed on cocaine. And I'm lying in a hospital bed with my eyes in the back of my head, nose bleeding, and stuff like that. I kind of - I've lived it, I've witnessed it. I don't like it. And I guess that's what bothers me a lot. Is in order to avoid those situations you got to... you can be involved in them, but you got to be really tough. And I guess that is why because of these - even to this day since when I go back to the (inaudible at 22:16) and I have a horrible day, I want to turn to... to drugs. I want to turn to alcohol. But mostly I want to turn to chewing tobacco. Because chewing tobacco or just any substance is what I like to do. I don't know why.</p> I don't know. Because whenever I do get overwhelmed, when I get stressed out, when I get uncomfortable, I've always turned to it. Whether it be alcohol, whether it be drugs, whether it be tobacco. That's the one thing I guess - you know how some people have high blood pressure or high sugar and all this stuff, they tend to (inaudible at 23:11) an easy solution, a quick fix?</p> I think that's kind of what I look for when I get uncomfortable. When I get too emotionally riled up and too anxious when I cant' function anymore.</p> That's what - exactly. It's wanting to just calm down and not think about stuff. And not get engaged or... or pissed off or just calm myself down. It is - and that's kind of what it was. It's kind of like what I feel every time that I'm... I'm at the... at the restaurant. It's just - and even when I have good days, it's fine. But those one bad days, you know, that's what scares me the most is when everybody is on me, everybody is critiquing me. And I don't think I'm doing bad, that's when the anxiety kicks in. That's when the drive to do alcohol, to do drugs, to smoke a cigarette, to have a... a chew. Those are the things that get me. And I'm not saying that they... they help me. Because the more I do it, the more and more that I want more of it. So it's kind of defeating the purpose because before I was doing it as a relaxation, but now as I'm doing it I'm slowing getting re-addicted to it. And it's... it's very scary for me. Because I do - then that's the one thing I do, you know I have a concern about is becoming an addict again. [25:03]</p> I feel like I'm leaning towards it. And it's like I said to my cousin and my uncle is like, ""I'm not quitting... I was quitting for the hours and stuff. But I'm mainly quitting for myself."" Because I do feel those cravings, I do feel those needs to get high trying to take over my body.</p> Uh-hum.</p> I think it was after I... I smoked marijuana before. And it's been three months since I've smoked. And I think maybe because it's all that chemical left my system, and because it was in there for so long, I think it's my body craving something.</p> It's craving the marijuana. It's craving the alcohol. It's craving you know whatever it is.</p> Worth, self-worth. Being someone who is... is proud of who I am, of what I do. Having other people be proud of me for who I am, for what I do. Because I guess I really haven't' gotten it. Even as a kid, I was always a heavy kid. But I was the one who used to - family... my family used to criticize me for my weight. And criticize me for being a fat kid. And every time I go to my grandmothers, ""Well, why are you eating this? Why are you feeding him this? Why are you letting him eat this? Why do you eat so much?"" I guess there's just a need to fit in, a need to kind of be that perfect person just for a day. But I know that I'll never be that perfect person.</p> I think they mask them, yes. I do think that, yes. I do think that when I'm on... when I'm... when I was high or when I was intoxicated, I didn't really think (inaudible at 27:45) I didn't think of anything. It's kind of that way. You know how people say when you do stuff, you... you're on... when you're high or you're drunk or whatever, you feel invincible?</p> That's kind of how I feel mentally. I feel like my mind is so clear. And that nothing can enter it no... no matter what people say, you know can hurt me. Because it's just like that force field, that shield, that whatever happens just bounces off and goes away. And then after that it, once the... the effect wears off, then all of a sudden, everything starts eating at me again. And it's like a vicious cycle. And it's only - and that's... this is why I do get nervous because I didn't smoke marijuana until I went back to the restaurant. I went back to the restaurant and was like, ""Oh, it's only marijuana."" Well, that's how it started beforehand. It started with only marijuana. Then it moved to prescription pills, then moved to cocaine, then move to whatever else. [28:56]</p> In a way, yes. But you got to remember, every time I stepped into the restaurant since I started it 12 years ago, for the first 5 or 6, the only thing I know about that restaurant is drugs. That's all I know.</p> Yes. That was when I was really first exposed to cocaine and prescription pills.</p> Their previous - Okay. So Abe bought it from this gentleman whose family ran it. The gentleman's nephew was running it, but he was also running a huge cocaine deal. He was a dealer. He had six houses, seven houses whatever. Tons of money, living on the edge, hiding it by using the business. Well, he ended up getting caught. And he ended up spending six years in jail for distribution of cocaine. Because one of his clients got pissed off at him because he wouldn't hook him up and then ratted him out to the police. Well, he was - put it this way, he did so many drugs he was out of his mind. And then I started working there because, he came back for it from my aunt and uncle because they didn't... they just bought the business and they were looking for staff. And they were trying to help him out. And he was the one who introduced me to the hard drugs. He was the one who help introduce me to where I could find these drugs. He was the one that he... he gave me a lead, kind of like whenever because I had known this gentleman since I was a little kid.</p> I did because it was a way in. I kind of was growing up, I was kind of a risk-taker. I did crazy things. I was kind of a person who liked living on the edge a little bit. And I was like, ""Okay. I'll do this, I'll take whatever."" And I was a... a huge risk-taker. And I guess for me I, you know like I mentioned before, I did like the attention. Because the attention that I was getting was so consuming to me, it was like... I felt so powerful. I kind of felt like someone who was in charge.</p> They needed me and they knew who I was. People, who never met me, still knew who I was which is kind of what I liked. It was kind of that euphoria of being the President of the United States. But, ""There's Jordan."" Well, what... like it's just like, ""Oh, they get a glimpse of me."" It's just like, ""Oh, wow, that's... there he is."" And it's just kind of that lifestyle kind of it - I didn't choose it, I didn't want it. I kind of just fell into it. And I had everything I needed to love the business. And that's what I was doing.</p> He had it down to a science.</p> And he goes, ""There's people here, you give them stuff and nobody has any idea what's going on."" He said that's why he was so successful in doing it for so long. Because nobody - and that was my downfall was (inaudible at 34:29) it's not impossible. I don't give a shit. I'm here all the time, might as well make some extra money on the side. And that's exactly what I did. I mean, am I proud of it? No. In a way, do I wish I got caught? No. But I wish someone who knew what I was doing could tell me to cut the shit. And... and the repercussions of what it was leading to. But for me it was just the euphoria of being known. There were times that I'd be working 13-hour shifts and I'd be outside 6 of them. ""What the hell you doing outside for 6 hours when you're supposed to be working 13?"" [35:13]</p> No, they never could find me. And I also had the guy who was covering for me. Which didn't really help. Because it was - I was giving him a piece of the pie and it was just - it is what it is.</p> Yes. Absolutely it's a worry about myself. Because I... I don't want her going down the path that I have.</p> No, I don't. And I kind of feel now that you mention it, I kind of feel like when she does this, I kind of feel like I see myself again. And it's like a splitting image of... I see her doing it and I'm observing and that's when I get engaged. That's when I get pissed off. Like, ""No, you can't do that. Why are you doing this? No. This is what's going to lead to that."" And for me that's a... a... a... a - it kind of is exactly what I'm feeling. Is that I am feeling this sense that that's me. That is me doing what I did to hide my problems, to cover up what I was really feeling instead of getting it out there. And that scares me. It scares me a lot.</p> Uh-huh. And I - it just - I can't... I can't explain it. I'll be on... I'll be high or whatever and I'll just completely shut down and forget about everything. And then the next day, I'll feel terrible. And then I'll wake up, and that problem is still there. And it's just like, ""Well, what did I really accomplish? How much longer until can I mask it?"" But it definitely, since I stopped smoking marijuana, since I - it was good. I stopped smoking marijuana. And then as soon as I went back in the restaurant, that first shift, half through that shift, I craved it. I wanted it. I needed it. And I told myself, ""No, you're fine. You're going to... you don't need it."" And then I worked the whole next week. And then the... the urge and the... the addiction and whatever it is that was inside of me, was craving it. I needed it, and I... and I wanted it. And I wanted to so bad. And I knew where to get it, but I didn't get it.</p> Yes.</p> Okay.</p> Yeah, 3:15 works, that's fine.</p> Thank you.</p> It's just once a month?</p> It's always a Tuesday. I'll let you know usually.</p> But it's usually this is the second Tuesday... second... it's usually the second Tuesday of the month.</p> Okay.</p> Yeah, I'll e-mail you and let you know. Yeah.</p> Yeah. Okay.</p> All righty. Thank you very much.</p> All right. Thank you.</p>",2
1000122145.txt,"No, I just thought that it was, you know, other people change roles, too. They don't know that they do it, is, you know, it isn't as clear to them.</p> That's my whole problem. Couple points I wanted, before I go into a friend...I was talking about a close, well, the circle of friends that I've been hanging around with. In fact, he had (inaudible). Before, do that, and I could clear up, finish up physics.</p> And in order to...well, I tried to figure out what my motivation would be in physics and to see how that fits into this little mold I have of myself, of pleasing other people. And I come up with two entirely different analyses of it. The first is to may be fit the mold, I go through the following (inaudible). When I was in high school, there was, you know, there was no one particular field. I'd just sort of take everything and I did fairly well in everything, and then we had the Scholastic Achievement Tests. And I was in a brand new high school, and well, I got a perfect score on math, and that was, ""Hail to the big whoop tee doo,"" because I was the first one in our high school. Well, big deal. Well, anyhow, that was sort of math. Because here's our buddy, mathematician.</p> Yeah, so it's not right. It's there, there it fits fine. Now, that isn't so bad, I don't' think. I mean, I had math, I mean, I had student physics professors who ended up being physicists because it was the shortest line in freshman registration. So, there are all sorts of reasons. Well, now that's...that would mean if that's true, if everything else that I just did, then clearly, I should drop out right now. Why even go through with the test, but even to prove it to myself, if you went through that, then go through the test. Now, the analysis that is different from that, is when I was at the (inaudible), it's a liberal arts college, I had to take, you know, social sciences, and I had taken other things, and I would have to admit that there was nothing that I took, and I took, general (inaudible), although we can't very well say, though, from 100 level course, whether or not I want to go to that, but I can't really say that there was anything that really fired me up.</p> Maybe the art and art history work, but more as a dilatant, I think, starting a life long mission, so I don't really think that there was anything that I wanted to get into much more deeply than sort of a life perusal to appreciate the principles thereof, and say, ""Well, that's kind of nice."" So, I can with some comfort, come to the conclusion that it was my decision. Now, if that's the case, why would our last session go the way it was? Why was I so down in physics? Well, I don't think it's a fair assessment to say, ""Well, I fell about it now, considering the last six months I'm going through."" I mean, I've got this horrible, heavy thing that American education has put over my head called the big test, qualifying (inaudible), and it's not a real fair assessment.</p> Now, so those are the two analyses. Now, the second one, if we go back to last time's tapes and we say, ""Well, I'm going to come up with something that will make me comfortable. You know, I'm going to stay in physics...""</p> ""Well, there it is. I came up with it. I want to (inaudible) up there."" So, I don't know whether I did come up with it or whether it's true. But at any rate, it's clear, as I told you the last time, that I'm going to go through with it. I'm going to finish the next two years, I'm pretty sure, for whatever reasons they may be and I think I'm going to get my degree. Well, I like to think, it's the latter analysis. But, I think, really, the next two years will tell, or the year and a half that it takes me, because that's really the fun in physics, doing the research, you know. Without having to worry about teaching the course, or if you're a professor, worrying about tenure, you know, your first few years, or getting a publication in. Really, when you're working on a dissertation, most people don't care if it's done, they like it to be done in a couple years. But I'm going to wait and see before I make any judgment on physics to see if I'm discoursing my career plans to fit this mold that I've got, of pleasing other people, of not pleasing myself, or whether, indeed, it is my field.</p> Yeah. Yeah. Now, does that sound like I just went home and thought for a week to come up with a comfortable decision and came up with one, or do you really think that's the case?</p> Well, you see, that's the problem. I really never know what I think because I've never really thought for myself. So...</p> It's a damn good answer, you know, I can really live comfortably with it, if I really want to deep down believe it. But, it's so hard to tell, because as I said, I don't think I've ever really had, sure, I've had feelings of my own, but I don't think I ever really come up with major decisions like (inaudible) decisions of my own. Well, that's where it lies there. Maybe it might come up again. I just wanted to set it straight.</p> Acknowledge it. The other thing, I also made an analysis last week, or developed it over the weeks, of...that I am really attracted to a girl because she's my inferior and she's around me, and because she's around me, then, I can feel superior to her then, or I accept her as a challenge and it does my ego good to win her over. I just want to point out, as a good scientist that there's not enough data to make any good (inaudible) inference.</p> I would say yeah. The only time, and (inaudible) withdraw anything that occurred before I was like 19 or 20, because number one, I've changed so much since then, and number two, I was immature, and I think there was a lot different motives involved. So, that being the fact, I can tell you what happened in all, let's say, two or three times I've been infatuated since then. But I can't say, ""Well, I do it because of this."" I might be able to say in one particular case, why.</p> Okay, so those are a few things I wanted to say.</p> And I think a couple times I decided to get back with the people I made contact with quite frequently, and (inaudible). The...well, I'll just see tell you how it happened. I moved down the (inaudible) and turns out the people across the (inaudible), are four girls living there, three of whom were single, three of whom there was no attraction, as far as I'm concerned, whatsoever. They just were too different. They were nice girls, but there was never anything there. They were fairly quiet little school teachers. One or two I've met sometime in the mall, but they were...so we became shallow friends. Subsequently, by the way, one of my roommates, the one that moved in with (inaudible) is now marrying one, and the other one turned out to be Laura, the girl I talked to you about. Laura was, at that time, engaged to the boy in (inaudible) of her building, who has subsequently become, I would say, over the past two years, the person with whom I had the closest contact. Not the deepest, but the most often.</p> Yeah, most frequent. The deepest is clearly (inaudible). Now, I tried to think about how I interact with these people and how it fits in with the me, and I think it boils down to pretty much to a mistake, because the relationships actually failed. I never really sat down and talked to Rich about important things. I mean, we've talked about, I've given (inaudible), because Laura (inaudible).</p> The deepest things we talk about are political issues, and we're pretty much flat on the same lines, so that it seems to me as though it's another protection, (inaudible) I think. I don't want people to get inside me. And it was clear with these people that there would be no probing. Not to say they're not the probing types, it's just that our relationship never developed to that extent.</p> Yeah.</p> Right. Now, the other problem is the affection problem, and that's really strange. That's strange, indeed. Rich was a (inaudible) before this. And Laura was fixing any meals and we'd do everything together. It was really great because we enjoyed each other's company, and enjoyed (inaudible), partly she got on my nerves, and partly because of this, thinking about why and everything. And she definitely made advances during that time, most the time when she was drunk, but that's beside the point, and I completely turned away. Now, why I knew this relationship with the group, I don't know, other than it's a comfortable interaction and I don't have to worry about any pretenses, because of the proximity of the relationship, there are no fences built. They know how I act and how I behave. But they don't really know anything very much about me.</p> But why is that affection there between the two of us? I don't know, it sort of fills a void in part of my life, and the standard joke is the that...well, outside of the joke of Ted, that I horribly perpetrated, is the fact that I'll never meet any girls in physics and I'll probably never have any dates. Laura's gone through that time and time and time again. And not...</p> Yeah, it's sort of like, for instance, we'll go out to a dinner or show and something, the group of us, five (inaudible).</p> And the standard little part of the thing is that Laura and Rich are going to bed together, and well, Wes is going home with Chrissie, you know? (inaudible) well (inaudible). And so that's basically the...but why...I don't see the...you know, not like this.</p> Yeah, it's a real comfortable thing, it has been. And now I look at it and, well, before I Look at it now, it seems to me that it was comfortable because it wasn't deep and the people were generally compatible. Of course, the circle goes beyond that, because they're the ones that (inaudible) most significant brother and the brother, Carl is living there now. And (inaudible), beside the point, beside the point. It was comfortable, it was non-probing, and it was a compatible relationship that protected me from having anyone know me, much less myself. Now, the few times I was...I guess fixed up by Laura, she would find some girl she had been working with or had some friend, it was really tense. And that's the problem I came here with, I would say, meeting a new person, even though I was with the old comfortable, old shoe people. Zap, it hit, there I was behaving very consciously again, worrying about every word, worrying about how this person was looking with me, even though I was with the old, comfortable people.</p> Subsequent to, I think, my talk with Ted, she got to go...she doesn't like Laura at all, it's understandable. I'm trying to figure out...well, I look at Laura and I see really glaring faults. I mean, she's really very egocentric. No matter what comes into the conversation she's always worried about herself. Maybe it's just that I found an identity with her, maybe I'm egocentric, too, and that's why it's, that's why I'd be comfortable with her. But the last couple of times, I've been with Rich and Laura, I don't want to say a friction, but there's been an interaction that wasn't there before, because I see things that I didn't see before. And I'm no longer...well, I'm still comfortable, in other words, I can interact comfortably but I sit back and I look and I see the things I didn't see before.</p> Yeah.</p> Right, and, funny you should mention that. I was talking to the other roommate that I have, John, he is probably, of my friends, the least likely, well, yeah, all across the board, behaviorally, he's very quiet and he sits in his room and reads a lot and I don't, I get out and...well, and he's also probably quite a bit to the right in his political views, and I'm quite a bit to the left, well, in some fantasy, to the left these days. I'm a regular old student.</p> And we had a talk the other day, and he mentioned, I didn't go real deeply into things. I've lived with him two years, and yet he doesn't really, he knows how I behave, that (inaudible). But anyhow, I mentioned some of the basic thoughts I've been having, and his basic contention is there either has to be some line that provides all the oil that smoothes out all the roughnesses that help people interact. The same analogy you just gave. And he said the whole world couldn't behave without the oil, and my contention is, of course, it's a bad analogy, because who else could? I mean, it could be 100 percent honest. There would be a real problem in the transition era when the people that are used to hearing false compliments wouldn't hear them anymore. But nevertheless, I think that the world could be...could exist through the roughness. But now, the point is, why didn't I see them before, the roughnesses? I guess I just didn't want to. It was nice enjoying when I did.</p> Yeah, yeah. So, why even, you know, why rock the boat at all?</p> If you didn't think about it.</p> Now, that could be the case, that I no longer will enjoy the shell, I think. Or it could also be the case that I'll still have it in my life, but not with this type of person.</p> You see, the major glaring fault that Laura has, I think, is probably my major fault, that I immediately covered, I think, in most instances. I feign modesty whenever anyone brings up a challenge. If it does crop up in a conversation at a party, at first I'll deny it, because I know eventually, I'll go back to the person I heard it from and re-confirm it. And then it should (inaudible), I hope. So, I'm really an egocentric, very conceited, but I haven't been any better than Laura. So, maybe I saw this in Laura, that's why I identified with her. Said, ""Oh, that's my kind of person."" So, it might not be the case that I never will have this really smooth relationship with certain people, but it might be that I'll have it with different people.</p> Yeah, you can't be really deep with everyone.</p> You can't walk up to everyone and give them your philosophy of life. That ain't going to work, but you know, it's (inaudible), yeah, they'll develop, other relationships that I (inaudible).</p> Yeah.</p> (inaudible), self-hate, I think. That's what brought me in here, disliking myself. And I think now that I'm seeing in her the things in me that I dislike. I think I'm...as I said, I think I'm very conceited, and you put that conceit right there. I don't know if it is or not. I know when I was at college, with a guy that I...he's really a great guy, lot of fun, he dropped out. Every now and then, you'd think he was just a goofball, but he'd come up with some major insights, and one particular time, he was also, he was also (inaudible) that didn't study and that was drinking a lot. One particular time, he was just about passing out on the floor of the dormitory, and we had been close, so I decided to help him.</p> You see, ever since I was little, my parents reinforced it. Everything that I've done well, they've reinforced and encouraged me in it, and showed me to other people and said, ""Wow, look at this first grade great little clay model he made. Isn't that tremendous?"" and things like that. So, it's probably deep in there. It's a good thing to have him...I can't get rid of it. But then, too, it might be what it's all about. The reason why I'm here, is probably ego.</p> Yeah. Or...I'm wondering how it would fit in. Making the premise, just by the way, I don't know...do you notice any of my thinking being different than most people's, as far as like, applying it to a scientific method type thinking?</p> I've noticed that, too, but I seem to have been doing that with this, which, although I do ramble at times, every time I try to synthesize, I end up with, well, a reasonable approach. Well, anyhow, now I lost my train of thought. Oh, assuming that the basic number one problem is...reverts back to ego, and that is really what is there, that I'm just as conceited as hell, let's see if we can, let's take the (inaudible), (inaudible). If it is ego, then I would only...if I were completely egocentric, I would only worry then, about, yeah, sure, I would only enjoy it if people thought well of me. I would only want people to think well of me. Therefore, I would do things that would make them think well of me.</p> I could care less what I think of me, it's only what they think of me, therefore, I do only what they like.</p> Well, them (inaudible) their way. Is there a word for it?</p> Okay.</p> Well, I can't come up with a contradiction, either, when you said this. They're either both the same, I'm not sure.</p> It's not so much feeling both of them, it's...you see, my feelings and my...prior to this, my feelings and my drives all seem to be pretty much the same. Now, my actions, I shouldn't' say my feelings. Now, what the drives are is the problem. Why do I feel that way, why do I act that way? Now, if I feel and act that way because I am egocentric, then I do it because I only want myself to look good. On the other hand, if I do it because of other centric, well, then I do it because I want them to be pleased with me and therefore, they will be comfortable. One way, I can make myself out to be a complete ass, the other way I can make myself out to be one of the greatest oil in all of society.</p> Ah.</p> Could very well be both, you see.</p> I think I've developed to the point where I'm only happy when other people are happy with me.</p> If that is indeed the case...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, happy with what I do, yeah, yeah.</p> You know, the same old number one, going back. That is only, I think, two times in my life, except for shallow encounters. I mean, one time things, when I get mad at someone or just don't give a damn about what's going to happen to someone, (inaudible), except for two times. One of those times is now with my roommate. I'm going away, there was no interaction, and one time, there was a girl in high school that I just gave up on.</p> But, isn't that amazing, by the way, that you can live with a guy, and you come up with two, three weeks now? I've never seen a more complete conflict of personalities in my entire life.</p> I don't know if we should go into it or not, because I don't know. I think...I don't know if there's anything to reflect on here. Well, I'll think a minute, and (inaudible) we'll drop it. When Bob moved out, we got to talking about a new roommate, and he said, ""Well, there's a guy in the lab, (inaudible), have him come in. So, on fourth of July last, we went...no, 1970...what year? �71, �69, the fourth of July, we went to the fireworks display at McIntire Field with him, and I got to see him and he got to see me, and fine, you know, great, let's have him in.</p> Yeah, and I think there was probably a competition there. He, in his quiet way, was trying to impress the group with his erudition and overall worldliness, and I pretty much was assumed to be, well, there was certainly no athletic connotation, there was sort of like another part of my personality. The competition or the...yeah, I was considered probably the most educated of that whole group because I was not just the physicist, you see.</p> The other people were high school teachers and things like that, and they were in graduate school. But the three of us, Bob, Steve and I, we were the physicists. But I went beyond that, because I had a liberal education and if discussion ever turned to art or anthropology or something, I could say something.</p> Right, well, I was a real...</p> It was a real ego boost to be in the group. Okay? But now came Mike and there was a tremendous competition there in the group, and it kind of deteriorated to the point where we really didn't say anything good about each other, when the two of us were interacting. And then, oh, the smallest little things would occur. I would see...something would rub him the wrong way and I'd just try...it used to rub me wrong. I mean, little tiny things. Leaving spoons on the drain board, after you wash the dishes, face up, they're going to get a puddle in them. And he hates puddles on spoons. Things like, unbelievable that people can do that, but it's just sort of like, isn't that bad? It would sort of escalate, you know, and more and more and more. And now it's just, wow, it's just unbelievable. We just simply don't interact anymore. And it all, I think, boiled down to a competition thing. And, oh, Ted's statement that I surround myself with inferiors, and the things that I do, seem to be born out, that I was superior in this group, and I certainly, there were certainly other groups I could have been, lived with, and been around, but this was the group I chose, because there was no challenge there, and I guess Mike represented a challenge.</p> Yeah, subsequently, he's fallen from the group pretty much. I mean, he doesn't interact with the rest of us anymore at all. But that could very well be his nature. He's very quiet. He doesn't interact much. I don't think there's much to be gleaned from it, other than the fact that this just sort of fits in, I mean, you know, I mean, I'm egocentric. I surround myself with inferiors, and he was not an inferior. He came into the group and therefore, he was...there was a conflict there and I won.</p> Yeah, there's a real problem here, you know that? That is the fact that I've got everything figured out, you know, well, okay, I'm (inaudible) in my ego, I interact with people just please them, I'm going to let physics go because...I mean, all these things that I've got figured out, and now I'm just coming up with these answers to fit in. I don't know that that's the way to do it.</p> Well, I don't know, it's one of two things. It's either that on a very...the analysis that I've made so far is just (inaudible) analysis that I came up with, and it's pleasing to me to have something settled on, and I'm not worried yet about what we're going to do about it, because I'm still talking about it, still hashing it through.</p> But I'm coming up with more examples to reinforce that this is the case. Or the case as it is that I've made some, you know, there's been some divine inspiration, and I have, ""Ah..."" come up with the answer, and this is what it is, and everything is lo and behold, fitting neatly into place. I don't know how to...</p> Yeah, so it's clear what we do. We find another person and I try and bring out everything I can, as honestly as I can without trying to fit him into the mold. I think (inaudible).</p> I don't know who to bring up. You see, there's one problem, anybody that's close to me now, I've already talked about it. And anyone close to me in the past, is past, and has changed so much. Okay, let's take Lobe. Lobe. Okay, now I'm trying to give you just the facts. Okay? I'm not going to shape him at all, to...</p> Okay, I came here after (inaudible), and I think I've mentioned him before, you probably don't remember him. Everyone calls him by his last name, I don't know why, Lobe. When I came here to New York, I lived in a business dormitory, because I came in the summer, and that was a cheap to live, and Lobe went to (inaudible) with me and he was like an overlap between B(inaudible) and New York. When I came here I was pretty super straight. Well, it was �68, and I was just for McCarthy because everyone else was, and I really hadn't thought about much. I had been reading the New York Times in college, and (inaudible) working my experience in math.</p> Everything, everything, you know, and they really enjoy it.</p> And frequently, too, but then you sort of know and you get back in...you know, maybe every other weekend or just for 2001 when it comes to town or whatever the case may be. And that year with Lobe was the wild year. And I was really comfortable with him. There was a time, after we lived together for quite a while, that once in a while a trait of his personality got to me, and that was the fact that he never did a favor for anyone, that he never expected one from anyone in return. If he gave you a pencil, the smallest little stub of a pencil because you were short once, he would expect one back sometime.</p> Or if he loaned you a match, he would expect...which is neither here nor there, you know, but he remembers all these little favors that he might be forced to do.</p> Yeah, it finally got on my nerves. But I look back on it now. It's certainly not a bad character trait, because he never expected, the old, I don't know if you remember, the old first principle approach, but if everyone acted that way, it would be fine. You know, if everyone would agree to that. But I wasn't at the time. I would do a favor for someone and then he...eventually, it would wash, and then I'd get one back. I didn't track. So, there was a little conflict there after we had lived together a year (inaudible) something like that. But basically, we got along very well. The depth of our relationship was...it was deep only in the sense that we were close together so often, like, that first summer, for instance, all the time, that he could glean a lot about my character from that. Now, with Rich and Laura, I'm close to them, too, but not nearly as close...they're living in a different building.</p> And I don't see them every day, every waking moment. We would eat three meals a day together.</p> Yeah, and the only time I wasn't with him, I was with physics. So, Steve got to know me. As a matter of fact, did I mention...remember, two sessions ago, I told you that it was Steve that told me the girl who tried to commit suicide?</p> Well, that's (inaudible). And that was in (inaudible), you sure that's what you want to do. And I think that's what started the physics discussion, because he realized the fact that I didn't see, and probably before I realized it, certainly before I realized it. And I think he might have mentioned it back then, but then that was a perception I didn't want to hear it. I didn't want to believe it. And so he probably...he probably saw him in me a little bit. Just by the way I interacted and one of his lines, a week ago, now, was, ""Are you sure physics are what you want to do because you react better with people, certainly than you do with physics?"" Or numbers, equations. No, I wanted to draw a conclusion. I'm going to have to watch that. What else can I tell you about Steve? I think that's about it. I'm sorry, I can't tell you. There isn't anything deeper, but...</p> Yeah. But that was a while ago, and I don't know that...there isn't much insight with Steve, but I bring him up because I'm looking for another person to see if it's the same mold.</p> Okay, now, there it's out. I don't think I made any conclusions, did I? Now, I've got to draw them, let's see. It's certainly not the case that I saw him as my inferior, that I surrounded myself with Steve. However, I don't think that there was much choice when I came here. I, well, yeah, there was a choice. I could either move into the dormitory where I knew actually no one, and it would cost $50 more than it would in this business dormitory, or I would move into that one, which is, I think, (inaudible) was important to me. And there was someone I knew, that knew his way around, he'd been here a year, he was a year ahead of me. He'd been here a year so he knew his way around, so I don't think the decision ever really came, and so I said, ""All right, there are sometimes, here's an inferior, I want to live with him so I feel good."" As a matter of fact, he's clearly a superior. His academic excellence is something I can't hold a candle to.</p> So, that's not, I think it can be not because it was a decision made my...I don't think there was any other decision to make.</p> Actually, looking at it, it was much better, going into a new place, it was better to have someone laid the groundwork.</p> However...however, come into New York, being completely ignorant of who would be here. Might...I don't know, but I might have had a fear of surrounding myself with superiors, (inaudible) with physicists.</p> That's so long ago, I don't know what the motivating force was. But I don't think that that was much of it in my (inaudible), I think the important thing was, as I said, little, every day things.</p> Okay, now, did I do things to please Steve? I clearly changed. That was my big metamorphosis, living in that dormitory right away. I became...I have since sort of stepped back a little bit in a more comfortable role. But I was way far out there. And under his influence, (inaudible) certainly not anyone else in the dorm, we were really looked in to that. I mean, we (inaudible) average business, he lost (inaudible) for Jack. But that certainly wasn't with Steve. Steve had long red hair down to his shoulders, and it was really weird, saw in the resume because he had a picture that came from his college graduation. By the way, when he graduated from college, he again, had the hair down to his shoulders and had the beard. And he had it shaved off and it was in the front page of the paper.</p> Well, all right, let's, it either was or it wasn't or it was somewhere in between. So, let's talk about either it was or it wasn't. If it was the case that I was influenced only by him in order to please him, yeah, I did pretty good. Pretty good job of it. I developed his habits, his interests, his outlook, you know, pretty close. There were very few major differences. And now, if it's not the case, but it was sort of evolving, and (inaudible) should or it does go through. (inaudible) comfortably. And then that could have been the case, too. It was a real dead end street. I don't think we're going to get any answers there. Which says something, too, because it says that maybe I'm only pulling out relationships that I can glean something from that fit. That fit, you know...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. But you see the thing is, I'm not here because I interact with everyone in a certain way, and I want you to help me with that. I'm here because of something that's happening to me, if it happens with only one person. If I'm lying to one person, it's a problem, it bothers me. So, just because I have someone that doesn't fit into...that might be the right conclusion, it doesn't mean it's not a problem.</p> No. Because then you don't have any (inaudible) to (inaudible). You see, there's a problem with more than one person. I mean, it's happened any number of times with...especially with new people. When I really...</p> You are?</p> Oh, yeah.</p> Good point. Very good point. Right. Okay. Now, the...okay...how about that? That's true. I never thought of that. You really caught me there. Yeah, I got...if there are people with which it didn't happen, that's significant.</p> Yeah, that's right. Oh, well, all right, I'll give myself some good (inaudible) when I go through the other people I can go through. There aren't that many. I mean, what can I say? Now, wait a minute, these are people I'm close to I'm worried about and the people that are...that isn't what I came here initially with. I came here with the problem with interacting with people that didn't know me well, and putting up a fa�ade.</p> So, I really should go through those people. I think...</p> Oh, that's not true, either, because you see, you never develop any deep relationship. You see, here's the problem, if you start a relationship with a lie, it's harder than hell to get back to the truth.</p> So, the problem that confronts me is one of...that I came here with is one of the new people. I run into new people a lot, so therefore, I don't develop a deep relationship, because lies are short-lived, so eventually, they'll do you in. So, I haven't developed any deep relationships because I never get past the first date, honestly. The relationships that I have with people are built on lies, or are so shallow they haven't gotten to the truth/lie state.</p> Yeah. Yeah, I guess that's pretty much it. See, the...yeah, if I could just begin to interact with people honestly, just, you know, know myself that that's it, then I think that the depth of other relationships would come. It's almost, I just have to have a complete cleaning out, though, really. I don't think there's going to be any great loss for that.</p> Well, I think my contacts with people are just going to have to be...the people I know, everything is built up on lies and pretenses.</p> Yeah, it's either that or just to realize that that may be hopeless. I don't think I'll ever have a great relationship, now that I look at it, with Laura and (inaudible).</p> I just can't. If I were to go to them now, and just talk completely honestly, they would think that that was the dishonesty and that everything in the past was honest.</p> Yeah.</p> If I were to go to them with a new me.</p> No, they wouldn't believe it. If they knew I was coming here and having deep discussions about myself, they'd be amazed. They think I only...I think that they think that I don't even look into things like that and it wouldn't bother me. Wouldn't bother me. They think that I probably am as shallow as our relationship.</p> Now, what I've mentioned now has been giving me thought, but what...oh, well, at any rate, what I'd like to do is, clean house. To begin relationships honestly, rather...the only honest relationships I think I have are ones that just are forced into honesty by proximity.</p> Which is a fair indictment against me. I would like to have a relationship that would develop honestly and would be probably be just...if you compared it with...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, it seems to be the case. Yeah, a good example of this is, you know, high school and college. You...there's so many people around you. Well, a high school is several hundred. A college class is what? Four or five hundred. You're rubbing elbows so much that when you eventually do make a deeper relationship the honesty is pretty much there.</p> And then when you come here, a large university that you can get lost in, the minute a relationship is developed, you can be dishonest, because there is no elbow rubbing. There aren't faces you see again and again. You can walk down the midway and see a set of completely different faces. A completely different set of people, so that...well, no, wait a minute. I think I lied just about as much as they want. As I do here. So, maybe that proximity thing doesn't fit. You know, I think I was pretty much na�ve and immature back then, ill-defined, kind of. Bouncing around from one (inaudible) to another. Of course, that's the whole point here, isn't it, that I know at times I don't know what I am. Well, I'd settle on the image of protecting what you want to see.</p>",1
1002133157.txt,"Pretty good. I haven't been too... Well I can't that. I haven't been too disturbed. I've been keeping pretty busy. However, I'm in that going-to-sleep routine again.</p> And I don't, you know. And I don't think I really need the sleep. But I just sleep.</p> Oh. Well like last... I've been making it a point to get home at midnight. And usually at best, you know, I go to sleep at midnight. And I feel that I should wake up around 8:00 or 9:00, you know, 8:30 in the morning. And it's to my advantage to wake up then, because then I can get a day started. And I'm discovering that I am waking up at 9:30 and 10:00 and 11:00.</p> And then in the afternoon if I get tired... Like yesterday afternoon I went in and I thought, ""Well I'll flop down."" I was sort of - I had been drawing all day and my eyes were tired. And I thought, ""I'll sleep for an hour or something."" And then I'll go to sleep. And this was at 5:00, and I woke up at 8:30. [0:07:01.8]</p> No. I hadn't bothered with the alarm except that I know that for a fact last night I slept through a phone call. The phone rang, and it didn't wake me up. And the messenger boy from the desk had a package, and he came up about - he said about 6:00. And he said he knocked and knocked and knocked on the door. And I didn't wake up.</p> Yeah. And, you know, and then like an unexpected noise I would - I actually think I would wake up, you know, more rapidly. At least I used to be a very light sleeper; anybody walked through the room and I'd wake up. [0:08:02.4]</p> Well up until just recently - over the last year - I've always been able to flop down and say I'm going to sleep for an hour, and sleep for an hour and wake up.</p> And now I'm getting, you know, like I don't know, an attitude if I can sleep... Or I don't respond to what I'm telling myself, that I'm going to wake up.</p> No, which I used to could count on.</p> You know, if I'd say, ""I'm going to wake up at 7:00,"" I'd be up at, you know, five minutes 'til.</p> No.</p> But it's... It's just the... You know, it... If I have to get up I suppose I could... You know, I would use an alarm.</p> But just the... What bothers me is this idea of, ""Why am I wanting to sleep so darn much?"" You know, when I know it's physically not necessary for me now because I'm getting more sleep than I ever have. [0:09:00.8]</p> Unless it's, you know, just a habit that I've had and it...</p> Mindset, probably. This is the only thing I can figure.</p> ...I have, you know, seen some of the boys that I've known; and we've gone to dinner and things like that. But this is why I've made the point to be home by 12 o'clock, and I hadn't... I ain't had no sex at all for two or three weeks. Because I haven't made it with any of the girls I've met yet.</p> And, you know, I have the feeling that maybe I'm sort of hiding behind sleeping, you know. I know - I don't - I'm not getting the sex I would like. So I go to sleep and sleep it off, you know.</p> That's the only reason I think- thing I can figure. Of course I don't feel frustrated in any - particularly in any other areas.</p> No,. Now this is also a strange part. I was noticing this morning that since this - you know. Since I decided I was going to try - really working at getting girlfriends, I mean I haven't been at all particularly desirous of sex. You know, I haven't - just felt like, ""Gee, you know, I've got to go out and find something or somebody.""</p> Of course for one thing, frankly, the times I have felt I wanted to have some - you know, sex for relief, it's just too easy to masturbate. You know, I can always take care of myself that way, which isn't - you know, doesn't really solve the problem particularly.</p> Except it is relief.</p> Yeah I do. I think that I'm... In one hand I'm thinking, you know, that... You know, I want this, and logically this is what I want to do. And still I'm... There's something, you know, more subconsciously - and sort of sneaky subconsciously I must be fighting it. Or dodging it - dodging it, not... You know, taking the easy way out. [0:11:12.6]</p> Well that's the que - that's the hard one, frankly. Because I don't think I'm afraid in the sense of being afraid of the girls.</p> I mean, you know, I'm not physically afraid or even emotionally afraid, I don't think. I mean a sex relationship... I think what I'm afraid of is probably just the going out and the first... I'm really afraid of the first contact, the - how to get into it. [0:12:13.7]</p> Right. Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And that's when I, you know, I get terribly shy. And I get all - you know, messed up. And I think probably what I am doing is to - is - you know, ""Well if you oversleep, then you don't have to go out.""</p> Yeah. Right.</p> Well it sounds too simple to say they won't like me. You know.</p> And I'm sure that's the bottom of it.</p> But am I building a lot of crap? It's, ""I hope they won't like me,"" I guess.</p> Yeah.</p> I don't - I can't say if that's just it, though.</p> It's like... You know, I defeat myself before I go out. Because pretty - half the time I just said, ""Well I'm going to go somewhere."" And I'm - you know.</p> You know. So already before I - you know. I'm cutting myself short before I even start.</p> And I don't know whether...</p> It probably is. It probably is.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I guess... I'm - I mean that's right.</p> But I don't even think I gotten to the stage of finishing it up and saying, ""That would be terrible.""</p> I mean I'm...</p> You know, I'm not rationally say... I mean I'm not logic - I'm not open to saying it.</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> Also involved in there is that as we talk I am realizing that I am still very - too much on my own terms. Like when I go out to the Modern and I want to meet a girl and I don't meet her in the first ten minutes...</p> ...then, you know, it's a bad deal. And I want to go out and go home.</p> You know. I'm sort of making the effort but not really the effort. But it's just a...</p> Well but unfortunately I was - you know. I'm looking for somebody good enough for me, not me good enough for them. [0:16:08.1]</p> And I think this is part of the...</p> They ought to come flocking, and they don't right then.</p> I think that's even more than the fear.</p> I mean the fear of the fact that they are not going to come flocking.</p> You know, that more than the physical fear...</p> Yeah. You know.</p> Yeah. Because, you know, I get... It's a crazy thing. I get all this shit from everybody that, you know, ""You're a good-looking guy. And, you know, you shouldn't have any problems about meeting people.""</p> And I do. You know, I just flat out do. And I go out with this great feeling of, ""Gee. You know, I'm God's gift to women."" And nothing happens. You know.</p> Well I don't know about the rest of the world, but I do.</p> Well that's it. I think that's really... You know, a lot of the problem is that I... And it's... I finally made up my mind that I would work at it and... But I'm not performing.</p> You know. Up here I've said it once that I'm going work at it. But then I'm...</p> ...bucking it by going... At meeting people, at pushing myself a little more into walking up and saying, you know, ""What's you name?"" Just that. [0:18:00.9]</p> Yeah. You know.</p> Yeah.</p> The goal. But I am not seeing that...</p> Not really. That's where I get bogged down. And that was part of... The other day I was... I've noticed after I had been talking to the whole group that I keep talking about things. And that, in a sense, is my thing. [0:19:07.2]</p> Is... I mean the goal is - I'm seeing some sort of a goal as a thing rather than working on me.</p> Yeah.</p> I mean - and like that first date is the thing I am shooting for. And it really shouldn't be that important to me.</p> Oh it should be important. But it shouldn't be the base for later.</p> That's it. Yeah. At the same time I must - just out of sheer fairness to me and the discussion - admit that I have been noticing pretty girls more lately.</p> And, you know, occasionally on the subway. I have not yet - I have yet to get the nerve to walk over to a real pretty girl I've seen in the subway...</p> ...and say, you know, ""I'd like to call you"" or something.</p> But I've been seeing a lot prettier girls than I have.</p> And discovering that I'm noting that the prettier girls I am seeing are younger...</p> ...than me, which had... I never noticed people - girls - that were younger than me.</p> They were always my age or a little older. [0:21:01.4]</p> Yeah.</p> I'm - and I'm sure that's it. But I really am noticing them a lot more.</p> Yeah, that there are pretty girls around.</p> At least I can look at them now.</p> Yeah.</p> Um hm. And I've even been active enough that I have made a couple of passes at people and, you know, been refused. But at I've - I'm sort of trying even there. Oh.</p> Granted that one of the gals I made a pass at is as sick as I am, I think. ""Er - I'm one, too."" But, you know. At least I had a chance in the subway to make known what I wanted to ask them. [0:22:08.8]</p> No.</p> No, actually. And it was... As I was saying, you know, it was - it's a girl I know. She and I have known each other for a long time and sort of been, you know, just good friends for years. I still - I find...</p> And - but I don't think I'd ever get anywhere with her. She's just a little too keyed up on being a big businesswoman and - one of the editors of Harper's and Vogue, and her career is going to come first and all that kind of stuff.</p> So that she sort of builds the wall up, too. [0:22:55.2]</p> Yeah. That I had no idea of.</p> You know. Yeah. And I felt - and I really did find that I could make a pass without being embarrassed myself and having...</p> ...you know, made an proper approach or something.</p> And I didn't get hit. So I guess I came out on top.</p> Yeah. Yeah. I mean I came out more plus than minus, I guess. [0:24:02.1]</p> Four or five.</p> Um hm. I've been very reticent in that area. I will admit it.</p> As a matter of fact, Dave, even in carrying further back I don't think I've every made a pass at a guy. It was always, you know, they chased me.</p> And I'm sure that this has a lot of bearing on it. I want the women to chase me, too.</p> You know. It's an old habit pattern, one of those, you know.</p> Yeah.</p> You can say yes without being the villain of the piece.</p> Yes.</p> You know, that's pretty true.</p> No. It wouldn't be bad this time, you know. And this I can... I can logically believe this.</p> Yeah. At times.</p> Yeah. And somehow I don't catch myself saying it to myself. But that's...</p> There's no type of pattern. And I... You know, I don't even really know when I say it to myself, you know.</p> It's like a dodge.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> But the - what I am saying is that I see it after the fact.</p> After I've fallen asleep and wake up I think, ""Uh-oh. It's 8 o'clock. And Shatzi (ph) usually..."" You know.</p> ""You goofed."" But...</p> Yes I will.</p> And also I must admit, too, that on this thing... It's not just that I... Work-wise I am still working, but not as... It's like in the last two or three weeks there's - everything is sort of like gotten soft-pedaled.</p> I've done some good work. And I haven't - I hadn't had too much commercial work coming in, so I've had time to do samples.</p> Yeah.</p> I'm sort of - yeah. I'm sort of, you know, just in general procrastinating or even blaming one area for another.</p> You know. Like, ""Well I didn't get the work today - done today. So I have to work tonight."" Or if that's not the excuse then, ""I worked too hard today and I'm going to take a nap."" Or, you know. And it - and I'm making a vicious circle, I think, of...</p> Another dodge, really.</p> That's right.</p> Basically I think there is... It's a real shy... I think - or not basically. But part of this is that, you know, when I start thinking about, well the idea of, you know, going out and meeting people I start getting A, financially afraid. [0:29:07.7]</p> Because, you know, it's... You know. So if I might find somebody and I do fall in love and I should want to get married, who can afford it?</p> Which is also an excuse and a smokescreen, because I know a lot of people who have afforded it on a lot less than I have.</p> But right now something occurred to me.</p> Occurred to me, is one... I think one of the few pieces of motherly advice that I forgot was, ""To get married is a drag.""</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Um hm. Literally.</p> I think 13 or 14.</p> Yes. This was her general attitude: that, you know, she wasn't real happy with being housebound. She - and she... [0:30:00.6]</p> Well I was told that a couple of times, ""Now, don't get married."" You know.</p> My little brother provided that commodity.</p> I used to grab that as something to use.</p> Really. That was a good excuse. Mama said it, so that all right.</p> Yeah. And also I must admit, this is one of the reasons I think that so much - really I'm very financially oriented in that sense. Or I'm scared shitless of property, let's face it.</p> Yeah.</p> But that was involved with that, you see. And I'm sure that at the time that was Mother's bitch was. It was, you know, ""Don't get married, because I got married and look how poor I am.""</p> You see.</p> And somehow marriage and poverty go together.</p> And then maybe - I'm sorry. They just do.</p> Um hm.</p> Yeah. And this is why somehow... Well and even in the - when I was growing up I couldn't date because I never had money. I mean, you know.</p> And it was very... And we were, you know, sort of in an unfortunate position of being one of the old families in the town with no money.</p> And you were expected to take your date to the country club or...</p> At least I was taught that that was you were expected to do.</p> And I couldn't afford it.</p> Yes. [0:32:01.3]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, you know.</p> That it was going to be all or nothing. And I didn't have the all. And - but maybe if I had... You know, if I saved my money and never got married, I might someday be able to afford to take somebody out. You know.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> The only trap that - the trap that I see to that is that you put everything off until you are too old to enjoy it. [0:33:00.7]</p> What you do do.</p> Yeah. They don't tell you what it's wonderful to do. That's the problem, you know.</p> No.</p> That's right. Because... No, I think... And that's what... I'm still fighting, you know. I've come to realize that, you know, I sort of wasted 15 or 20 years... [0:34:11.5]</p> ...on, you know. Not wanting to be alone but being alone, definitely.</p> But I am still having to fight the other one about the economic crap and the ""You wouldn't be so a good match if you didn't have it.""</p> Well sure. But...</p> No. Logically, now I realize it wouldn't.</p> I've just got to be able to accept it.</p> I'm having that same trouble. I can tell myself the right sentences...</p> ...at the right time sometimes, you know. But I don't really accept them 100%, that that's really right. [0:35:02.2]</p> No.</p> Yeah. I'm not even saying the sentences. I'm getting so busy in other areas - or making like I'm so busy that I guess... You know, back here somewhere I'm saying it. But I'm expressing it in work or in...</p> ...you know, running around.</p> I wouldn't. You know. And this I know. I wouldn't if I weren't saying that.</p> And then I say I'm not doing anything. And that makes it even worse.</p> Don't pull your head off.</p> You might need a longer string.</p> Now that's the upsetting thing about... Somewhere I can see logic or illogic when other people are talking sometimes. You know, not understandable. But I can talk myself into the most delightfully logical circles, you know. And I can't catch the flaw. [0:37:16.9]</p> I don't - well yeah, I don't catch the flaw. I don't see it.</p> Yeah.</p> And, ""I'd like - I ought to go out tonight, but where am I going to go?"" This is...</p> This is one of my standard sentences...</p> ...that I've got to learn how to say: ""Well, you know, go anywhere. You know, go ride in the subway for two hours.""</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> You know. Well actually I don't... You know, I suppose... You can't... The problem - part of the problem, too, is you can't just say, ""Well I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do that."" You have to be doing them both at the same time, and being aware that - what one is and what the other is.</p> Grain 1 and Grain 2 in this case for me, I think, have to come with - pretty much hand in hand.</p> I've got to work at it while I'm thinking about it. But I've had to start thinking more logically.</p> You know. Which is which?</p> Yeah.</p> ""I wonder what causes this.""</p> Yeah. I know what I'm doing.</p> I think it's more in the terms of grandiosity than fear, although they - I'm sure they mean the same thing when you really work it back.</p> Yeah. But I have much more of a tendency to take the grandiose side than... Like I really basically... I don't think I feel that I'm a pretty shitty individual. I think I have more of a tendency to think I'm like the grandest little thing that ever hit the earth. [0:40:10.9]</p> You know. Why doesn't everybody recognize it?</p> You know. Like somebody asked me one time what would I like to - what would I really like to do? And I said I'd like to... If I were completely honest, the thing I'd like most to be would be sort of the darling of the social world, you know.</p> And this is a very grandiose attitude. And I - you know, it's not going to happen just by wanting it.</p> You know. And I... Even looking at it I know it's a pretty crappy thing to shoot for. But if I just - you know, if wishes were horses and that was the wish I would make and then probably get.</p> Until I learned how to - or until I catch myself and change.</p> Is to prove that I'm not bad. [0:41:02.3]</p> Yeah.</p> No.</p> No. See when I'm the... When I am alone and just working with myself, I cannot worry about whether I am being accepted or not accepted. Because I can get very absorbed in what I am working at.</p> And that is... It's a very pleasant little dodge: Get busy. Because then you don't have to think about it.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I don't turn it off after the first eight hours and then go out to meet the girls.</p> Um hm.</p> No. No I didn't like that so much. Now I've gotten to where I even fight to be alone a lot.</p> Very selfishly I have one friend, I must admit he's a grand friend to have because he's loaded and he loves to take you out and spend all the money.</p> And he'll take you to the best restaurants and the theater and all this, because he's scared shitless of being alone.</p> You know. And when I first met...</p> ...and he knew that we had sort of a falling out. And he liked me. And I said, ""Look. You know, I'm through with guys. No hanky-panky involved I know your game. And if you want somebody, go pick on some other little boy.""</p> ""I'll be glad to see you on occasion."" And it's gotten to the point where every night he wants to go somewhere and do something that demand (ph) plans. And I've just had to learn how to say, ""No. I'm sorry."" [0:43:01.6]</p> But I'm not interested in him sexually. And he knows it. And as long as he wants to buy my company, that's fine and dandy by me.</p> It does take away from the time of going out and meeting girls, I must admit.</p> No. In fact, last night - or night before last, he had invited me to dinner. And I thought we were going out to dinner. And then he said meet him at the apartment. And I was there, and there were four or five people there for him. And the party got to looking like it was going to wind with everybody, you know, going to bed with each other. And this wasn't for me.</p> Finally good. I can - you know. So it's their problem if they can't accept the fact that I will do what I want to do.</p> No. And I have found that in that area I have... You know, that's an area that I know well enough that I know I can turn my back on it, and to heck with it.</p> Now this is what I keep saying: ""Now why can't I reverse the procedure?"" But I'm not doing it.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. It really is. Well it's - a lot has to do with practice. In the area with them I'm beginning to practice this thing, ""No.""</p> I'm beginning to.</p> No. But I mean look in the last two or three weeks...</p> ...for instance. I said that I was through with all that crap.</p> I'm finding that it's very easy to - or not... But it's not difficult to say...</p> ...exactly what I want and what I intend to do.</p> And, you know. What the world does to it...</p> Now I'm sure that's true. And I'd guess there is... Basically there has always been this thing, too, that I've never really accepted that females were - that girls were not different from men - very different.</p> You know? It's that I've always assumed that women reacted to everything differently. [0:46:03.0]</p> I had never taken the trouble to really find out that they don't. That they want sex as much...</p> ...as men want sex.</p> They - you know.</p> Yeah. And I've never accepted that. So they were always like a little goddess somewhere.</p> And even now I find if difficult to just be myself in the sense that it's just another human being I'm talking to, not...</p> ...something special and big, you know.</p> You see.</p> Yeah. And I see...</p> ...logically that it is possible for me to work on women.</p> Yeah.</p> To really work on.</p> On just accepting women as people, not women as some special thing.</p> Yeah. [0:47:02.8]</p> Yeah.</p> And the main thing...</p> ...is to concentrate on the object and not on myself. I'm not...</p> That's a pattern in my life, that's suggesting everything that...</p> Well that was... You know, at least that's good to know. Good. At least I don't feel like I'm absolutely - you know, and not involved about this.</p> No.</p> Yeah. Once I am erect, that - you know. And actually I have gone all night without losing an erection.</p> You know, the [hope's there] (ph).</p> But as I say, it sometimes takes forever to get me there. You know?</p> Yeah.</p> You know, well not to... I don't think it's... Even now the panic has been kind of how great she's going to think I am. At least I don't consciously think it's, ""Look out."" It's, you know, ""Look, if you don't perform you're going to lose this whole situation."" You know. And when you are already capable...</p> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p> And I've been working on it, really caring whether she thinks I'm the greatest lover she ever had. Because I care about her.</p> Yeah. Wow. At least that made the biggest... You know, I feel like I'm in a big performance. And it's like, you know, a year ago...</p> No. I feel fine. And I put myself in a position often of being, you know, like forcing her to be aggressive at times.</p> And these are old tricks.</p> But...</p> Well always.</p> You know, I don't think I ever felt I approached a guy.</p> Except putting myself in a place, in a location where it was obvious that I was out there to be picked up.</p> Yeah. I think so. And I'm - in fact I feel better about it. I have also been...</p> ...a new relationship I took up a few nights ago - well not a few nights ago. Actually it was I guess the week before Christmas, during the week before Christmas.</p> Her stuff was there. And, you know, we spoke to him. And he was watching TV in the living room. And we quietly went into the bedroom and sat and talked for awhile, you know, thinking that he had to go back to his room.</p> And we can take the TV because it's a portable, and he didn't need to take that for about a half an hour.</p> At least I was not conscious - I think I've gotten over this. Especially the fact that he is gay and he is...</p> You know. [0:56:00.5]</p> And so that...</p> Yeah. I think now I've gotten to the point where, you know. What other people do is their business.</p> And I've got to worry about me.</p> No really I haven't. No I really haven't. I've - I still see quite a few, of course, because I... Or, you know, people that were particularly friends.</p> That, you know, maybe at one time that I had had a little sex thing but had never spoke up.</p> And I've made, you know, no bones about telling them that hey, I'm interested in meeting girls. And that I, you know, that I have a girl that I am going with.</p> I was really glad of this, because it certainly automatically removed its own temptation, kind of, you know, being - to go to the party.</p> ...not my problem as to whether they worry about what I do. And then...</p> No. And actually it - you know. It's upended. I think they really... To be perfectly honest, it was a combination that was the easiest target and habit.</p> Yeah.</p> Because let's face it, you know. In fact it was very funny...</p> ...boasted, you know, background. But she has a lot of friends. And she knows that I've gotten through the gay bit. And, you know, unfortunately I didn't... I'd come out and tell her, but at one point she said - she asked me, you know, especially having met some of the guys I had been with and wondering. You know, I didn't lie about it. I said, ""Well it was true.""</p> It scared me. And frankly this, you know. It was, you know, petting and making love and going to the bed. And she said, ""Well I don't know whether you want to."" And I said, ""Well why?"" And she said, ""I'm in my period.""</p> And I said, ""Well does that mean you can't?"" Because I didn't know, honestly.</p> And she said months ago, ""Usually when a woman is in her period, you know, she's hotter than at other times because of her... But it's messy."" And I said, ""Well."" Then I started laughing. And then I said, ""Well I've gotten covered with shit. Who cares about a little blood?""</p>",1
1004532442.txt,"(laughs) Yeah. That would be nice. Maybe that's, that's how I'm going to make my big money, I can invent that.</p> (laughs) [Spend all my future] (ph) now, right? Oh man.</p> We schedule. We didn't really like get into details or anything, so, but she sounded really nice.</p> Yeah, she sounded like really friendly and calm and nice. That's like the woman I worked with before it was like stressful and had like the vocal version of like the eagle eye always on you. (laughs) I don't know.</p> No, she was a very stressful person. So, that will be nice to have and they have a normal doctor visit and just to prescribe something to try for migraines. So, which is similar to the metrixline I was on, but there's supposedly a less drowsy version [inaudible].</p> Not that it like prevented them from happening. Its main benefit was preventing them from lasting for more than one day.</p> But that's still a benefit. (laughs)</p> So, so yeah. (laughs) [00:00:02]</p> Yeah. (pause) Yeah and it's, I mean I think it's, you know, only the most extreme things. Like I definitely had mild versions of these symptoms myself, but the extremity and frequency was definitely increased by the Wellbutrin a lot (laughs). I actually, actually since I, since it got out of my system I haven't experienced any visual or aural hallucinations, so that's nice. (laughs)</p> Well I started to have a few before I started taking it which is why I started taking it again. But then it was like all day every day I was having them.</p> I would hear music that wasn't there, like a man singing with a guitar and it would be triggered by ambient noise. Like it was really cold that week so I had my space heater on.</p> It would turn the noise of the space heater into like a man with a guitar and then I would turn the space heater off and it would be gone. And the thing was I liked to have ambient noise because of the ringing in my ears, so even if I don't have, even if it's hot I turn on a white noise machine so I can't hear the ringing in my ears as loudly. And it would just turn that noise into like weird shit. [00:00:04]</p> And I would see sort of these weird like light patterns. Sometimes like the static on a TV and I see that even without the Wellbutrin, but the Wellbutrin made it happen like all the time. So there would like purple static or like weird shapes and like metamorphisizing light block shapes. (pause) And some people have auras sometimes. (pause)</p> Yeah, yeah it's definitely, I've had a lot more energy since I made that discovery actually. Not as much energy as I would in an ideal world. It just made me feel a lot more positive about the future. And about my ability to be in a situation that involves other people (laughs) now that I'm not as afraid that these people say to me can trigger those intense hallucinations that I was having. (pause)</p> I would definitely have reactions triggered by people saying things. Like, in two of my classes, I have these two classes where we talked a lot about like self-presentation through art and whenever they would use keywords related to that I would see purple. And so there are different like topics that would inevitably call up hallucinations. And when people said things that were sort of critical things sometimes that would trigger this sort of like intense wave of dizziness and nausea and static in my vision. So, I mean, people were like directly sort of threatening my ability to function.</p> And some of the things we talked about here would cause light hallucinations. Like you would get an aura and the wall or the chair would suddenly become very separate and have weird light properties. (long pause) [00:00:07]</p> Well, I mean it was like some other part of myself was highlighting that the topic was important. I mean it was never like, it never seemed like you were creating this hallucination it was always like this other thing in me [inaudible] that people did. So, I had mixed feelings about it when it would happen because it was related to topics that one hand I guess it's helpful to get clues about what this other personality wants me to think about and focus on. And on the other hand it was disorienting and weird (laughs).</p> Yeah. And there were sort of things when like my colleagues would say things that stressed me out or certain topics would come up in class that sort of upset me, the dizziness and nausea, like that was never constructive in the way that the hallucinations were. Because it's like, ok yeah this is upsetting and then like I didn't need that. I don't need to like feel like I'm going to like fall over or vomit (laughs). [That was very stressful] (ph). [00:00:08]</p> Sometimes when we're talking about some of the trauma things, like early on when I hadn't really talked about them a lot with people.</p> Yeah. (pause) Yeah, so it's hard because all of these things were so common for certain periods that it's hard to, when the point when they happen more than others, except I knew they happened more when others were around than when I was alone because when I was alone, I mean I didn't have control over what I would think about because I had this other personality just throwing things at me all the time. But, I still felt like I had more control than a completely different person who like, who knows what anyone can say at any given moment. Except I sort of know that you probably aren't going to say any like totally jerkish thing that [inaudible] (laughs) unlike my colleagues. (laughs) But, I don't come in here like, oh god what's he going to say today? (laughs)</p> Yeah (laughs), yeah. (pause) (sighs) Yeah, I actually stayed up all night finishing this book which just came out, The Vanishers by Heidi Julavits, which, it came out two weeks ago. It's funny because it has like this cover that makes it look like total chick lit (laughs)</p> But it's literary fiction and she's the editor of this sort of literary journal, The Believer. And it's really bad, gives her sort of cred to have a cover like this.</p> Yeah, it's sort of their like newer sister [inaudible].</p> And like I love that she can have a cover for this, oh wait, like the sperm book and get away with it. But, it's, it was crazy. I wasn't supposed to be reading it yesterday. I ordered all these new books which I also wasn't supposed to be spending all this money on new books. Lots of things wrong here, but I'm just going to read a little bit each day like a responsible person. But then, (laughs) but then, so it's a book about two psychics, a mentaler, and a student. And when the mentaler gets jealous of his student's abilities and psychically attacks her and like sets something that makes her really sick and she has physical and mental symptoms and needs to take all of these drugs and go to all of these doctors. And no...</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Yeah. And like no one knows what's wrong with her and people think she's just like faking it. People are like, ""Well just snap out of it."" And it just felt so familiar (laughs). I feel like there's been a period of a few years that I've been looking for a book that had a character I could relate to and I just haven't been able to find any characters that I could relate to in any books. Like a lot of time I can relate to the narrator or the narrative voice more often. A lot of straight narratives I can't relate to, but weirdly third person narrators who are more artful and you know, like stream of consciousness narration which is very colored by the third person narrator I can relate to. But, there's, there's something more</p> Yeah. So it's sort of interesting looking for an embodied character I can relate to and like this is the first one (laughs). So I couldn't stop reading it. I kept trying to do other things and say like in a hour I'll get a break to read a little bit more, but I just like read it instead.</p> So that really hit close to home and just felt that, felt so painful and then I go back and forth between being able to construct a world view in which things are sort of ok right now because I'm working on my novel and working on getting better and like that's alright. And a worldview in which I totally failed and I never know like, you know either one could sort of pop up in a given moment, of course the negative one is always more likely to overtake me because negative things are more powerful than positive things. And reading this sort of brought me back to a, it sort of just shattered me, kind of the delusion that things are ok right now. Because, you know in terms of the like actual circumstances of my life, if I thought about it from the perspective of like me a few years ago, they would not be ok. I would not be ok with it. So, you know, that was frustrating at first because it brought back to the feeling of failure at the same time that it was comforting to find someone to relate to.</p> And then to be told that actually...</p> Yeah, but I spend a lot of time worrying about what people were thinking.</p> And that I'd sort of managed to say like, well, I just won't think about them. But then that changed that. So I've been avoiding her ever since that conversation because it really got to me. And you would like to be able to say, well it doesn't change the fact that I shouldn't think about what others, what conclusions others are coming to because that doesn't really affect my life that much. But, it's hard to actually put that in action. (pause)</p> Not like you, like particularly you, just logic and common wisdom.</p> But, sort of having confirmed that my worst fears are true, like someone telling me it's definitive was really a whoa. (long pause)</p> Yeah and, and after she said that she tells me about the new diet that she and my dad are on. They've always been really healthy, but they're nutritarians most of the time which means like you eat 90 percent like fresh fruits and vegetables and 10 percent other stuff. And they'll go out to eat with friends sometimes, but they don't want to be like totally socially ostracized but they're trying to do this for most meals. And they've found this health guru, Todd Robbins, and they've been trying to get me to try some of his foods and stuff, but I don't like them. They're too healthy for me (laughs).</p> Yeah, because I like eating pretty clean vegetables, but I like putting fat on vegetables and then eating them (laughs) and Todd Robbins doesn't like you to put fat on your vegetables (laughs), he wants you to just eat the vegetables.</p> They use dressings, but they have like nut bases. And the thing is like, yeah nuts have fat in them, but it's not the same as oil. It's like taking the matter away from the fat. I mean it's like no wonder I've gained 25 pounds in the last six months. But, I mean I honestly think my diet isn't terrible because I do make an effort to include vegetables in it, even if I put fat on them first. But, I think my parents disagree. And, and they were saying to me like, ""You should just consult with Dr. Robbins, like it's really expensive so we'll pay for it because it would be worth it and, you know, it's just like if you could just control, even if you only get help with your migraines think what a difference that could make in your life."" And they implication there being that I need help with the other things too although she knows better than to say that; she knows that would make me angry.</p> No, she's trying, but it's like she just can't help herself. When she says these things (sighs), I don't know that it's, she like sat down and thought to herself if I think this is a good idea. It's like she just lost her ability to not say these things to me after repressing it for weeks or something. [00:00:23]</p> I mean she tries to act otherwise, but I mean it's unfortunate. Like, I know her too well and I can see what she's trying to hide and I mean, in this particular conversation she didn't hide it very well because she said to me like, my response to this was, I think it's a waste of money to pay someone hundreds of dollars for me to have someone tell me to eat more vegetables. And, and she was like, ""Well, you know [inaudible] you might be able to have like tailored plans for eating. He's not necessarily going to tell you to eat more vegetables."" And then she says something like, ""You know, like whenever you're ready to consider this we are, we are ready to, to help you.'' That wasn't the exact phrase, but it made it seem like they were the victims of my close mindedness in a way, which is bizarre. (pause)</p> Yeah. Yeah, but not even like, there would be something almost dismissive in that and this just like, you know, ""We're suffering so much because, you know you're suffering and you won't let us help you.""<br></p> Like my suffering makes them suffer and I am not exploring my options and trying hard enough. It's like I wasn't taking this seriously enough. (long pause) And I think I'm sort of sensitive about that (laughs), that I'm being told that I'm like not trying hard enough. So, I've been trying hard and I think there are always more things you can do with anything or try. I'm being sort of exhausted with trying and being told you're not trying hard enough sort of [inaudible at 00:00:27] at me. (pause) So after that conversation I was just like mad at her for a few different reasons. I haven't really been able to recover. And I have been avoiding her and she called a couple of weeks ago and I was just sort of cold and gave one word answers and then she sent me an e-mail, like ""if you don't want to talk you can just say you're busy or you don't want to talk, like, I don't want to bother you."" And I told dad that it was sort of immature to be extendedly rude to your mom. Like it would be more mature to say I don't want to talk rather than just like...</p> Well, I mean it's frustrating on two levels. One, like I know that she genuinely loves me and wants the best for me and like I don't think there are like weird ulterior motives or, I don't know. Like I know this is coming from a genuine place. And second, I feel like I owe her, like being nice to her at the very least because she really did like try very hard to be a good mother and put a lot of thought on how best to raise me and spent so much time with me.</p> I mean, I don't think she's been very destructive. I think destructive is too strong a word. I just think she's bad at understanding important things that are sensitive for me right now and avoiding those things. And, I mean, it goes to her upbringing. You know, my grandfather was very like rough with them and was very hard on his kids, like they didn't have enough money growing up so they grew up always a little short on food when she was really young. And before meals he would say to the kids, ""root hog or die,'' in his southern accent. In other words like, like they were pigs in a trough trying to eat enough food so they didn't get left out (laughs) and starve to death.</p> Yeah. So, I mean, you know she grew up in this poor southern Christian environment that wasn't geared towards like being sensitive to people's particular, particular abnormalities. And I just feel like being an intelligent person who thinks about how things work I should be able to engineer a good relationship between us and it feels like I'm not trying hard enough. (long pause) [00:00:31]</p> But, she does better than to make me feel helpless.</p> [inaudible] I, I think I'm sort of definitely stuck in this regard. There're like different pieces that I haven't been able to put together, to fit together yet. Because on the one hand, like I recognize that she sometimes says things that really upset me and it's a very small percentage of the time, but you know something a mother says is like ten times more impactful than something most people say (laughs). So...</p> Yeah, yeah I think I still do feel guilty like saying negative things about her. And I think there's sort of an ideal thing that happens when you become and adult where, I mean it's like a later life version of what Melanie Kriner talks about with recognizing the mother as the good breast and the bad breast, sometimes bad, sometimes not. It's like something like that is supposed to happen in your 20's where you see your parents as people with flaws.</p> Yes (laughs).</p> Yeah, yeah. That's supposed to happen and...</p> Yeah, yeah. And it's hard for me to gain it to that degree that it's happened because I sort of recognize that to have a healthy adult relationship with my parents I need to change the way in which I view them. And I know that have certainly a lot, but I don't know if I've achieved the depressive position yet (laughs).</p> And the idea that I know what I'm supposed to do and perhaps have failed to do it bothers me. Because like what's the point of reading all these books and knowing how these processes work if I can't even do them? Obviously like if, you know academics would all be very healthy happy people if that were the way things worked and they're obviously not.</p> (laughs) You'd probably go to the library instead.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> You know, I agree. You could push me something that I'll eventually feel guilty about saying. (long pause) But I'm still not clear about whether I should feel guilty about saying it or not. Or whether I, what I say, it's still not clear to me exactly how I feel about this. (long pause). I mean I think we've all seen models of people blaming their parents in sort of unfair and unkind and unhelpful ways. I think it's easy to see that as a powerful counter example. (long pause)</p> (sighs) I mean something seems very depressing about being critical, too critical of and angry towards someone who loves you and wants the best of you and has spent their life trying to make that happen and has made that the centerpiece of their life. To a degree that was almost, you know I almost wish she had kept up with her other interests more; tried less hard to be the best mother to me. It puts a certain amount of pressure on me as a daughter.</p> And that's funny because I don't think she's one of those people that, some people just always think they're right and think like that God gave her the gift of reason and no else and she's not one of those people. She feels responsible to think things through to come up with the best solution and give that to me. And because just not because of her superior neurosis it's like she thinks like she's being helpful and giving me the gift of her effort, but it doesn't make it much...</p> Yeah. I mean, she's a pathological person who tries as hard as she can with whatever she's doing no matter what it is. Like she just has to give it her best effort and like thoroughly think it through and, I mean, no corners are ever cut. Like she's just so thoroughly honest, like they wouldn't even sign a lease to, that had one provision that wasn't true that the [inaudible]. You know this is just made for show. Everyone finds that, they refused to sign the lease of the house they wanted because it would have been dishonest even though it didn't matter. And there's some connection between honesty and singular truth that seems to me not to be essential, but to her somehow is. Like there has to be a best answer. (long pause)</p> Or I should not deal with it and just do the right thing (laughs).</p> No. I mean having read a bunch of deconstructionist theory (laughs) it's impossible.</p> Yeah, even if I wanted to read the stuff in the first place (laughs).</p> Ok.</p> I'll see you next week.</p>",2
1004538608.txt,"Um (sigh), so (pause) something happened on Friday which was (sigh) you know kind of (inaudible at 00:00:24) but it's still bothering me...</p> ...so, um, it also involves Lucy so...</p> ...which is a little weird about that, but kind of going forward. Um, and so I had (yawns) tried to make plans with her earlier in the week last week.</p> And then it didn't work, um. So then I suggested that we meet after work, which to me is after five, which to her is after seven because she has people who work flex time?</p> And I was like, oh...no, I need to be home like...so I was like okay let's meet at 5:30 and she's like I'm not ready, I can't leave until about sevenish cuz I said after work, and I was like okay, whatever. Then I was like well, you know this Friday at seven my friend is doing a book reading at the Book Store and I'm like okay, is what we're gonna do is you and Ashby make reservations and I was like sprint over after therapy, and I was like order me a drink or whatever, we'll get small things, then we'll just go right there, so it's like...[ 00:01:39]</p> Ya got, ya know...</p> Yeah, like tight, tight timing, whatever. Um, like we have 15 minutes in which to consume food (laughs) and get over there. Um (pause) and so while I was walking over Ashby said Lucy's not here. And I'm like what? Cuz you know it's after six and I'm saying mmm, and then I get a text from her saying she was (inaudible at 00:02:11) depressed, was having trouble leaving the house and there was more traffic than she expected, so she's gonna be running late.</p> That was for earlier in the week. So we rescheduled.</p> Like we...earlier hadn't worked and we rescheduled to Friday.</p> And...</p> Yeah, and I was like it's super...like I said like it's really time crunched.</p> And...</p> Right. And then she's like oh, and then there's more traffic than I expected. And I'm kind of like it's a Friday night in Cambridge.</p> But whatever. So I get there and she's still not there and Ashby's pissed because like our whole plan is contingent on like eating really quickly and getting over there and I'm like mmm...so then whatever. I said we'll just order for her. I'll text her. It's like (inaudible at 00:03:22) like what do you want? We're going to be staying. There's no reply. I'm like...and then she comes in like 20 minutes late and says oh, I'm sorry I went to the wrong restaurant and then I left my phone in the car. And I was really annoyed.</p> It's like (sighs) like you can't be claiming it's late when we only have like, ya know we have less than hour to eat.</p> And also that you like left your phone in the car and I'm like uhh...</p> And I'm like okay, whatever, like it happened, you're here, let's eat.</p> And then she didn't like what we'd ordered.</p> And I'm like, well, mmm, and I was...I'd also texted her...I'd also texted her but she didn't get it obviously, saying if you're running really late just meet us at the Book Store.</p> (inaudible at 00:04:15) and like, so it was just kind of frustrating. Ashby was really pissed about it.</p> And I was more like...I was pissed at first but then I was like whatever, like...</p> ...it's done. So we're walking to the, walking over to the Book Store. A friend had already reserved seats for us, and um, my friend was talking...her book is about fat acceptance.</p> It was a good reading. It was a great audience. And like a lot of people I knew were there and like etcetera, etcetera, and so during the Q&A I think I had asked Elaina some goofy question and I was going to ask her a serious question but I didn't get a chance to, and Lucy said well, ya know, um, a lot of the fat fashion blogs I see are for the fem style for men who wear feminine clothing, and I don't like wearing that kind of clothing so where are the blogs for rich, fat people.</p> And Elaina's response is like there really aren't any. And my followup...and I was like yeah, and I was like oh, well, like this would be...there's two things you can do. You can look at blogs for (inaudible at 00:05:41) like chubby gay men and there is a blog called chubster which is all guys masculine fashion...and then Elaina's saying she's like but I don't like their fashion and I don't want to date gay men and I'm kinda like mmm, like sorry.</p> And, you know, and she's like your saying...</p> Yeah, I'm like there's nothing out there...</p> ...that I have really seen, like this is where it' at and she says like, and she was really dismissive about that and I was well, whatever. Like I've been asked that question a bazillion times. There's not really a good answer. Um, like you can pick out individuals but really there's not a good answer. So, um, and then Elaina mentioned like there are some butch fashion blogs that are also tangentially run by kind of some chubby people sort of but...</p> ...but like...</p> Yeah, like not a lot of butch or masculine guys' fashion blogs. It's like they just don't sew (laughs)...okay, yeah, alright. Um, so when it was over one of my friends I could tell she really was bursting to say something but wasn't for some reason. I said did you have something to say? She was like okay...well, I'm gonna be really polite and she talks a little bit about like plus-size fashion, masculine fashion and like what's happening there, and I'm not really paying attention because I've already had this conversation. I'm talking to someone else I know. And then I get up to stand in line to have my book signed and Lucy comes over and looks really pissed and she's like I don't appreciate being lectured to by someone, ya know. I'm an intelligent person. I went to Brown. And I was like what? Ya know. I didn't hear your conversation and I don't really...and (pause) and so she had interpreted my friend saying I want to be...I'm going to try to be polite as being really catty. And I'm like no, she literally is trying to be polite because she doesn't want to be rude to you, and she's my friend so she doesn't want to be rude to my friend.</p> Like, that's what happened. And so she starts ranting about how she's mad about that, and then Ashby turns to her and snaps something like you're being really rude and reductive and then stomps off, cuz Ashby's in a bad mood and I'm like...</p> And annoyed from before. And I was kind of like well...that happened.</p> Ya know? And I mean Ashby's really good at hitting like the jab that really hurts. Like, and plus she like knew the jab that really hurts and stomped off. And I was like huh. And then Lucy just burst into tears and...I said, I'm just like what just happened? Um, and (pause) she just sort of said...she, like and so she's talking to me and she said yeah, I feel like people are saying that I'm bad and stupid for asking about masculine fashion and that I shouldn't ask about it because like that's a horrible thing to do. Then that's okay you should just tell me so. And I'm like, no. I'm just what? And then she did ask me like well why did, ya know, Ashby say that I was rude and reductive. I don't know. I'm not Ashby.</p> I can tell you that Ashby's in a bad mood.</p> I...I don't know! Um, and she's going on about my friend Pat and I was like well, Pat was a nanny for 20 years. Sometimes people perceive her tone as being a certain way because she worked with kids for so long. I didn't feel that, but whatever, ya know. So like it's a possibility, and (pause) she just was like, I don't know, like she was, ya know, really upset and crying and sort of like asking me why did my friends do these things and I'm like I wasn't there for the conversation. I'm thinking I'm pretty sure that didn't really happen...</p> ...but like, whatever. And I also said like you'd have to ask that person. I don't know. And she said well I know that you don't know, but why? Like I...don't...have an answer. I'm like the other answer in my head is kinda like well, ya know (pause) there aren't a lot of options for masculine fashion and to say well, I don't like them when given like the two options, like that is a little flip.</p> It wasn't like huge but I was kind of like mmm. I was going to wait about for like two seconds.</p> Then (inaudible at 00:11:13) and, um, I think I tried to give her a hug and she was like I don't want you to touch me and I'm like okay, and while she's sobbing and talking to me at one point (chuckles) um, the office husband is like I'm really sorry. This person just wanted to see you really briefly, and I'm like Jesus Christ. I would love to talk to this person but Lucy's having a meltdown in the middle of the store...</p> ...so I can't really deal with that right now.</p> And I know, and I was like hi. You know me, right? I have to try.</p> And I can pull Lucy aside into like an aisle so we can't be seen.</p> And continue talking to her, and it was this whole like meltdown about how (pause) like stuff from her childhood and how people had told her that she's been rude, she doesn't understand, and no one will explain to her and (pause) just like all this stuff and she was terrified that this was another example of her like not...of her being rude...or of not acting correctly and no one telling her and people saying if you don't understand then you just...I can't help with it.</p> Right.</p> And I was just kind of like...it was a book talk. (sighs) And so after a half hour she kinda was calmed down enough that I felt like I could, ya know, maybe get my book signed, say hi or something, and (pause) she...and a couple times was like do you want to go out for drinks after this? And I'm like no. And I said, um, at first I was like, ya know, maybe you just...maybe you're tired and you've haven't eaten dinner. You want a full dinner. And she (inaudible at 00:13:25) again and then I'm like why don't you go home, eat something, drink some water and basically lie down. Like I figured as how you should do that.</p> Like, I feel like if you have an enormous meltdown in public usually means...like for someone to just stay home on the couch it like it usually means she was having a crappy day.</p> But she didn't say like do you want to hang out? Do you want to go for drinks? I've got my car... and I was like, I said no, I really don't...I don't want to.</p> Um, also cuz I'm thinking, look if you want to go for drinks you can't give me a ride home after.</p> And you're actually so upset I don't want to be in the car with you driving and also I'm exhausted from this meltdown so I'd really like to go home and lie down, like myself.</p> Um, and it was just I found it hugely frustrating and I was really...I just passed over a lot of things like...</p> ...like that she was late and like, and the like the fact that you left your phone in your car. Like, that's like...I too have left my phone in places or accidentally left the ringer off. But it was really frustrating, and then...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. It was just like I left my phone in the car, like...but it wasn't really...</p> ...and then...</p> Yeah.</p> No.</p> Yeah.</p> Exactly. And (sigh), I mean it sounds kind of harsh but we're not good enough friends for me to put up with that level of like crap.</p> Like, ya know, like and (inaudible 00:16:13)</p> And it was a lot to ask, and as we were like leaving the restaurant I was kind of like oh...I was thinking to myself I should tell her she should go get something like to eat up on (inaudible at 00:16:14) like grab a sandwich. I'm like she's an adult. If she's hungry, she should go feed herself.</p> Like I'm not...(inaudible 00:16:32) myself for thinking like oh, I bet she won't cuz whatever. (Sighs) She's an adult. Um, I also was pissed at Ashby for making a remark that she knew was going to upset Lucy. Ashby actually...Ashby apologized for that before we left though.</p> To me. (Laughs). Yeah. She didn't regret the remark at all...</p> ...but Ashby kind of was I don't regret what I said. I do regret the (inaudible at 00:17:06) of causing your friend to have a meltdown. But also Ashby was like I didn't think that that was gonna like...she didn't want to say something mean. She didn't think it was gonna turn her like a complete freakout.</p> Um, and then she's like I'm sorry for like kind of like (inaudible at 00:17:24) part of the evening and I was like well, mmm. Like, it happened and honestly while that was mean I would not...saying you're being rude and reductive and then stomping off I'm kind of like well, that was an asshole move, but like whatever.</p> And I also (inaudible at 00:17:48) I was feeling like I just want to go to this book reading and then hang out and you were having this meltdown and it's all about you and you've really been talking about a lot of things. You really focused it on why aren't you giving me resources to the things that I want. Like she specifically wants aspirational photos like masculine fashion but not men's fashion and not there's and not anything that's already out that, and I'm just like I...I don't know what to tell you.</p> Sort it out. Um, I also, Elaina had written this whole essay about how plus-size shopping is like always this like digging and digging through horrible ugly plus-size catalogues, trying to find something to fit your size and it's really difficult, and that's just not something that the people who can walk into a mall and find...and like just try on clothes appreciate. Which I tried to sort of relate back to Lucy. It's like, ya know, like mmm. Um, and then she went home that night and like angrily posted on her blog about how...it was just really weird and it was, it was annoying, so I'm like I feel like your passive-aggressively telling me about this, but then again you just told me about it for a long time, so whatever. But (pause) the way she talked about it, it was like everyone and like...she said I'm very comfortable wearing dumb clothing (inaudible at 00:19:34). I'm like, that's not true or else you're really uncomfortable with it. And so she was (inaudible at 00:19:39) about how she's totally comfortable wearing fem clothing but she didn't want to, and she wanted to dress in a certain way that she couldn't describe but she really wanted aspirational photos that looked like that and she was just really angry at everyone was imposing a gender binary upon her and all this other stuff. And I'm like, ya know what Lucy, I've been shopping with you. You don't...you're not comfortable with fem clothing. Like, she did report that she tried to be more comfortable with fem clothing for a while, like ya know thanks to Karen for helping with that. I'm like, yeah but you're not...like...</p> ...you're really...like you are more (inaudible at 00:20:26) of yourself than...</p> Well your actions are more (inaudible at 00:20:28) than you're willing to admit. And I found that really frustrating. It kind of re-upped all my irritation when I read it the next day. So I'm just like (sighs), like that's not what happened, it's not all about you and also you're really in denial about this thing.</p> And I'm like, I feel really...done talking to her about that stuff. Like, I feel done with it. Like...because I don't, I don't feel like...I don't feel like anything penetrates and I feel like she's dumping all this emotional crap on me without (pause) like (pause), without fair warning. Like (pause)...so I've been clothes shopping with transgender guys who are like I can't...clothes shopping is so hard like (inaudible at 00:21:50) blah blah. Can you come with me and be my girlfriend and that'll make this whole thing easier. And I'm like yes! I can do that. And then I know I'm like we're gonna (inaudible at 00:21:57) and that's, that's part of our little package of the shopping trip. Um, with Lucy it's partially I think my own like voluntary denial. What she says is I'm having a hard time with like fashion. I don't know what looks good. I'm like, alright, I'll help you. I'm anesthetic. I can impose it or whatever, but then it becomes I'm fat, I'm hideous, I'm unworthy. Like this whole spiral and I'm like mmm! And then there's also a lot of...</p> Yeah. And it's a fuckin' nightmare, and I'm just like what? And there's a lot of like passive-aggressive weirdness that happens too. I'm also kind of like, if you want me to make decisions for you, then let's do that. And if you don't, let's do that. You don't...like I'm not your mom. You don't need to act out to prove whatever. Like, ya know, like that's, that does not affect me. Um (pause) and yeah, so she didn't say anything about it all weekend to me. Um, at the end of the evening on Friday I was like let's try to hang out next week, and she said well, my in-laws are coming to town, and then she invites me to a house concert. And I'm kinda like (sigh), the house concert is a car drive away, which means I can't leave early if I want to. It's not actually music that I've ever listened to and (pause)...no? But (sighs) mostly I just like (sighs), I mean I know it's a pattern of behavior I have of emotional vampire friends. Um, like friends who are really needy and I keep on being like well, let me help you, let me help you. Um, and like I don't know why, so they always like fuck, like. I just felt really done with Lucy's, with like Lucy's fat hate and not wanting to talk about it. Not wanting to talk to her about it probably like none at all again because (sighs) (pause) it's the kind of intensity where I'm just like you really should talk to your therapist. Like, if someone's off-hand remark makes you feel like it has undone 20 years of therapy...I really can't help you with that (laughs) like...</p> Especially not in the middle of a book store, ya know?</p> Um, and like also (pause) it just...it's too much. Like I can't do that. Like...</p> Yes.</p> (Sighs). Yes. I have (sighs) (pause)...</p> I...(inaudible at 00:25:49) be saying no...</p> And like the two things that hit me the worst are people struggling with fat hatred and fat acceptance and, um, (sighs) great...now it's gonna be gone out of my head. At any rate, like that's one of the big ones, like...</p> (Sighs) Like I don't know...or no! Like my thoughts are just being really scattered but I'm like fat acceptance is one of those things where I'm like if you're feeling (inaudible 00:26:29) I'm always like, well I'm feeling fat, and I'm always like uhh! Let me help you.</p> And like the kind of other big one is, um, LGBT people who feel shitty.</p> Oh, that's what I was gonna say. Like the other thing I'm always sympathetic towards is like (sighs) light-skinned people of color who have like some crazy...like have like weird internalized racism or feeling like, I mean it's really common amongst biracial people this feeling like, ya know, I'm not really black. Like I had a time in my life when I was like I still don't know how to be black. And everyone knows I'm not technically black and like all this stuff and then I was like no, wait, crap...that's ridiculous. And I really did the same thing. And like, ya know, I just like...I kinda feel bad for anyone in that situation because it's horrible (laughs) and it's really hard to talk about it because most people who've gone through that rude self-hating stage don't really want to talk about it because it's...</p> Yeah, it's horrible and (sighs)...I don't know. It's like one of those things that just, just like...cuz you have to talk about like I was a complete jerk like for a long period. Like I was a jerk to myself and to others for this period of time. Because part of that is also usually...like especially in high school and college like, well like I'm not like those other black people or gay people. I'm different. I'm better and I'm special.</p> And so it also involved this like, they are bad and I am awesome because I'm like not...</p> Right, uh (laughs). Yeah. And it's just (sighs). Yeah, I mean so it's like, yeah if you function like...it's just...it's really kind of a horrible place.</p> And I see it like more often it's like teens or like early 20s. I'll see people like kind of having these feelings and I'm like, yeah, um, like I don't know. I just kind of want to give them a big hug and be like...you're not white and it's okay. Um, because a lot of that, like especially if you're light-skinned enough to to pass. It's like a lot of wanting to pass and then it's like no, that's so horrible for you emotionally, but I know why...I know why you're doing it, but you're gonna really regret that.</p> Um, and so like Lucy kind of hits the light-skinned person of color who has a bunch of self-hate plus the fat acceptance stuff and uh, (pause)I think she sometimes unconsciously like dumps on me about it.</p> Yeah and like I guess...I don't know if she wants me to fix it or what, but like I'll get this like...like I wanted to be talking about whatever and it's like there was this huge like emotional bomb dropped, and I'm just like uhh! I thought we were going to be talking about books or drinking some tea. I do not want...like this is not what I want (pause) and it also feels super one-sided because (pause) I mean like we aren't actually super close and so it's not like we're sharing like emotional...dropping emotional bombs on each other.</p> Um...</p> Yeah. Um (pause)...and also like (sighs) I do find it (sighs)...part of the thing about like getting the sort of body hatred, like someone dumping their body hatred like on to me like and verbally or whatever is that (pause) it really brings up....it...because it...often, like often people smaller than me and that's really awkward.</p> Cuz I'm like...</p> Yeah. And then people bigger than me and I'm like well, like I can't really argue with you. Like, like I don't know it's like it feels differently both ways, um...but it leaves me feeling like not really questioning myself but like it sort of like leaves me feeling low about my body for a little while. Um, like, like I'm having like I'll have like...I'll have a this is not a great body image day. Which I think everyone has but...</p> ...um (pause) and my friend Jenna who has crazy body hatred that she also expresses a lot (sighs) (pause) and so like feels the same way. I think...I guess the other thing is I also feel like (pause) mmm, for both of them I'm like there are resources out there. There are things you can read. I've told you about them. Like if you want to read like blogs about it or books or like all these other things. Like these are things that you can do that I've also done. Like you can blog about it. You can talk to your therapist about it. You can whatever, whatever. I'm not your only option and I don't like feeling like I'm here for you just to emotionally dump on me (pause) um (pause) and what frustrates me, which is always frustrating me, is I never really know...I never feel like I have a great way to sort of stop that pattern, or to say like I really need you to stop doing that, um (pause) because I always feel guilty about saying that, and I feel bad saying that to someone who is like really upset but on the other hand like I just really don't feel like...and (inaudible at 00:34:03) to being like sucky and upsetting and like emotional like also things. I feel like I'm spending a lot of my energy keeping myself afloat? Like I'm reaching for my own air mask.</p> And I can't help...</p> ...I need to put mine on before I can assist someone else, and I don't feel like I'm at all like, ya know, in an emotionally stable, awesome place to like help someone else out very much. Like (pause) I don't know. I mean like not entirely but like (sighs). I don't know, like, I guess I don't feel like, I'm like if we're all really, really good friends these are already like back and forthed. I just don't have time for it. Like, I just don't have time for it. I'm like I just can't cope with it. Like I just uhh. (pause)</p> Yeah. Um (pause) and also feeling like (pause) I manage to...like I'm no longer like a self-hating (inaudible at 00:36:40) person. I don't hate my body, and I feel like I got to the other side and I would like, I'm like, like actually hard and it sucks and it takes a while and like I kinda wanta like reach out and be like, want to give you like a hand with this.</p> Um, (pause) but with Lucy just...I...and not just Lucy, like I mean I just that was just like...that night I just felt like I was being dragged down more than anything else. Um, (pause) and I also was thinking of like well, I mean I tried to talk to her about like what were the specific things that like...</p> (Sighs)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, like, ya know and (pause) like no one wants to be crying in the middle of a book store. Like that really sucks.</p> Ya know...or like to be really hungry and cranky or like all these other things.</p> Um...And I know her husband was away for the weekend so she was like also depressed about that. And part of me...like the other thing I was also feeling like, is I'm like is (sighs)...which actually I do feel—it sounds a little callous - but I feel like okay, if you feel really depressed and you can't leave the house, you should just say I'm really depressed and can't leave the house. Like, that's...like that's the completely, like that's a reason to cancel on an event or to be like I can't do dinner early and that sort of thing, or like, or to be like wow, this is really upsetting, I have to go. Ya know like, ya know like definitely gone...like invited friends to events and have them be like this is really good but it stirred up everything so I have to leave now...</p> I'm like good with that.</p> Um (pause) I actually feel like (sighs)...I don't know (pause) (sighs). The best way I can describe it is I just felt like, like get your shit together. Like if you can't go out...like if you said you can't leave the house, don't. Ya know, if you're...thought someone was being really rude either say that was really rude or like don't. Like I don't know, like it's kinda like...</p> Yeah.</p> (sighs) Yeah.</p> It's also like I...when I'm feeling really depressed I worry about like...I think it's okay to say I'm feeling depressed, like I just need to cancel tonight, but I also feel like ohh...like I don't wanta be...I don't want my friends to think of me as that like that really depressed person who's always really sad or whatever.</p> Yes! [00:41:09]</p> But I also feel like, I don't know, like uuk! (pause) I don't know, I was kind of thinking about like friends and people I know who are my age who've like done like impressive things, like with their work or whatever. And I'm saying like well, you know to be honest like I haven't done any massive like career success but I actually feel like well, ya know, I've managed to consistently like get out of bed, feed myself, clothe myself, go to work, ya know, go to school, like...and some days that feels like that was the hardest thing I did, like, um, (pause) (sighs) which is frustrating because I'm kinda like, uh, like I do think like...like sometimes I do think like that was a lot, like I do feel like yeah, it's impressive that I haven't...that I've managed to like, ya know, at least look at myself staying together, employed, etcetera, but it's not something that you really get accolades about (chuckles).</p> Um, even though it would be nice. And...I don't know. (pause) I guess I wanted like (pause) like I was just really (pause) like I was kinda thinking like, like Friday's been a rough day. I'm feeling these things and then she'll like go from therapy to dinner to (inaudible to 00:43:12).</p> And I'm cool and not like...</p> ...depressed. It's a big crowd. Let's not stress about it. I'm making it through. I'm kinda like Lucy, I really just want you to do that. Like on this day of days I would like you to just either pull it together, like pull it together, don't just say like I'm going, I'm not going, or I need to leave, or just kind of anything?</p> Yeah. Like especially at the end of our conversation and she was really clearly wanting me to (A) go out with her even though like...</p> ...what the fuck now. And also kind of...it seemed like she wanted me to tell her what to do.</p> Like (pause) should she call a friend, should she have done like all these things, and I'm just like uhhh! Like I don't know. If you're hungry, eat some dinner. Like I don't (pause), I don't want to tell you what to do. Like I just felt like she was asking so much and not really acknowledge...like she kinda says like was like oh, I'm sorry. I think she said it like once but like it wasn't. Like I don't think...I think like it didn't...like she thought so much about herself and not really acknowledging like that I was feeling crappy, and like didn't like drop me a line (inaudible to 00:45:10) like sorry about the meltdown...</p> ...yeah...and it also says like ya know if you just want to get (inaudible at 00:45:18) or ya know like this other thing, like let me know. Nothing. And (pause) it just feels like weird, like (pause) selfish and like self-involved in this way that I don't like and...</p> (Sighs) During the course of the evening not really. Like (pause) I was really mostly...I was like flip-flopping between really pissed...</p> ...I mean, oh my God, let me get her off this ledge so I can leave (chuckles)...</p> ...and, I don't know. Over the weekend I was mostly feeling like this person being mad and frustrated and kind of taken advantage of in a way. (sighs) I guess what (sighs)...it does feel hard to sort of think about like ways in which I've been a good friend. I think in part because (pause) I don't really feel like coming back.</p> Um, or like a real acknowledgment of it, or...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Also I figured out I need to reschedule on Monday because I have another dental appointment.</p> The last of this series I hope.</p> That would be...</p> Okay. Got it.</p>",0
1000122150.txt,"Did you say which session it is or do you know? </p> ok, I didn't know (?) It was really a bad weekend. I uh...this last, uh yesterday, I said, ""my gosh it's Tuesday already!"" And I looked back on the weekend...and was very depressed because it was sort of a reversion back to before I even started coming to you. 0:00:25.4</p> Yeah, but look (overlapping voices/inaudible at 0:01:40) ...without even a thought about you or what's going on here. I mean that didn't even cross my mind it just happened so suddenly. I called one morning and the next morning I was to go in. </p> Yeah and...well...I talked him into giving me a lot of money. Well I talked his office into it. It's not going to be who I wanted, but you know...I still did it. And ah wow! I look back on it and say, ""Well I was doing a really great job."" I'd be a really great insurance salesman again. Which is just exactly what I don't want to be. But then again I did get it, which is, you know...</p> Yeah, so where is my head? Did I want...well, at any rate, I'm just saying that I was still good at it. And I lied through my teeth. Well, not just about...well, I didn't lie about things. I lied about myself. You know what I was. Had I gone in there as I generally look and act I'm certain I would have been out of the office in five minutes. There was no question. Well, so that happened and then the other thing was on...Monday, I went back to talk to my high school class. The old high school, not my class, but the high school. What I was really hoping is that I would look as ragged as physically possible. And then this thing came beforehand so, I was all neatly shorn for the kiddies and I really felt bad.</p> Yeah, that I looked straight. Wow, it was amazing, because...I don't know there is something about feeling comfortable in the image that you think your projecting. Whether it should matter or not. And I keep telling my self that it shouldn't matter. And yet it was perfectly clear this weekend that it did matter, a lot to me. </p> How I looked like...what I looked like to other people. Which is just such a basic simple ramification of my whole problem. You see my idea was to go back and be as radical as possible. But still show them that I had met the goals that they had...you know...their parents and teachers and everyone had set up. So I...like to consider myself as a radical as an influence. But there was no way in the world I could, there's no way! </p> Yeah! And I would, you know, I really felt bad. And that's really...now the fact that I felt bad makes me feel just horrible. Because it shouldn't have mattered at all. It should never matter to me. Really. What I look like. </p> I felt bad for two reasons. I felt bad because of the way I looked and now looking back on it I felt bad that I felt bad. But there's just no denying it. Its not like something you can rationally say, ""Well, I simply felt out of place."" I blew the whole thing that was going to be so cool. I was going to go back there and be the radical that made good, you know. </p> Yeah. Let's say...you got it. Then the third thing happened. When I went to Kendra's wedding out east, I remember, I don't know if you remember, but I told you about getting mixed up with a very nice girl out there but, just not acting myself at all. Just being a complete ass! Well! She was back in town visiting me and you see it was just like a complete reversion. I was so conscious about how I was acting because of what we had done here that it was just no difference. The thing about that is, the thing that makes it a valid observation is because that was one of the...way back...when I first came in...that was one of the things in my mind, the immediate things in my mind, that made it perfectly clear what my problem was. 0:06:31.6</p> Yeah, the point is...I think, I don't remember but, there was one time when I came in and said, ""Wow, a great thing has happened, that I was behaving differently. I don't remember what the happenings were but something had happened. And I was proud and I was happy. And now just the opposite is the case. And they were really good examples, they were just tremendous examples. This girl, wow it's the same girl, as a matter of fact everything was so similar. I even...the type of things we did. And uhm, whether I was...I don't know what I was doing. I guess maybe I was thinking more about it this time. But in the long run the way I behaved and the way I acted was not the way I wanted to behave. It was just...I don't know it was really bad. So very, very depressing weekend. One of the worst things about it, I didn't really start thinking about it until I thought about coming in here. 0:08:04.7</p> It wasn't completely forgotten. I mean it was there. I was thinking, but like, when I was back with all the kiddies, I really...I didn't feel bad about feeling bad I just was feeling bad. (inaudible at 0:08:34) I think you know what I mean. </p> And with this girl, it was the same thing again. I was more and more worried about how I was behaving rather than why I was behaving that way. Although I still a little bit back there I was thinking about it, you know, and the whole thing here. </p> I don't know if it's a matter of seriousness or whether it's a matter of futility. </p> Maybe not useless, but a hell of a lot hard than I thought it was going to be. Yeah. So if everything we've done, well everything that's gone on here is...it seems to be sort of like...well now it seems to me like, ""oh, well, let's see if we can find any patterns in your behavior. Well we found them, isn't that great. Now go on, go out and observe."" 0:09:51.5</p> Yeah that's nice, you know. I can see maybe if Jack the Ripper had an analyst he'd be able to predict when his next killing would be, I don't know. Maybe I'll be able to predict my next social coup, a bunch of lies. Or the times I botch it, when I end up being an ass. </p> Yeah, then what's the point? I mean I'm good at it. When I was home I had people impressed. And that's, you know, boring. Big deal, you know. There's so many people that I know that are just so far superior than me in just everything I do. And I can go back and make people think that the stuff I've done is impressive. And it's not. </p> Yeah </p> Well...I don't value the accomplishment at all as much as I value recognition from the accomplishment. And I'm much better at getting recognition than I am at accomplishing. </p> So I'm not...Well! It's the same basic thing, I'm not me. You know I'm not an entity unto myself. I'm just what other people want.</p> Well, the point is I'm not coming up with anything new really. With any analysis. I'm just...I'm not saying I'm any different I'm just saying that no matter how much work we seem to be doing and how helpful everything seems to be that I just slip right back into it. 0:12:12.5</p> Do you happen to remember when it was when I said I was doing so well? What I did? </p> Yeah was I with new people or what? I don't remember. </p> Yeah, I wish I did. 0:12:46.7</p> Yeah and the thing about it...as I said the most disturbing thing about it was that I was so caught up in it and so busy with it. But it didn't bother me until after I thought about coming in here. </p> It's not a complete disassociation from my mind but it's graphically below the level of major concern, you know? It's sort of like if I saw you in the crowd at any one given point I might think, ""Well, let's see about how I'm acting now. Am I being myself? Am I being honest? And then I just go right on lying. But I think about it. </p> Yeah, it's just the opposite of course. Well again maybe we can go back to if everyone I know died tomorrow. Those people back home and all people that in one way or another knew me. So I had (inaudible at 0:14:31.7) to hold up. Well, the question is you know, what I brought up last time. There isn't any real hope for overcoming the problem. There's hope for anyone (inaudible at 0:14:50.9) 09:00:48.1</p> If I were two people I would really hate that. I'd really hate myself. If I were the person that's talking to you now, and I was the person that was doing all that crap this weekend the former would really not get along with the latter at all. I'm worse than my roommate in that right now. I just, I...wow! </p> Yeah. Especially if I knew them real well. Just observing I'd just be seething inside. But if I knew the guy...</p> Yeah. But...I don't know. How about this? Maybe I'm just saying that. Because... No, I'm not just saying that. No, it's true. I was going to say that maybe I'm saying that because I have this image of me being this egocentric image of me and this is one thing that isn't good about me, the fact that I do lie. And therefore to better enhance my image of myself I have to get rid of this one last thing. So it's really just the same thing over and over again. Self-glorification. 0:16:22.8</p> No, I don't think so. It seemed like a reasonable thought to bring up. </p> Yeah, but there isn't any. I mean I would hate to think that all the time that you've (inaudible at 0:16:52.6) with me is wasted. But you see I had 25 years to work with myself before you had (inaudible at 0:16:59.8) sessions. Maybe that is the case, I don't know. </p> That I'm going to win. Or this other guy behind the door is going to win. </p> Right. If I were to fail the test I think it would be one of the best things that could happen to me, to the me that you're talking to. Because there's just so many things I could do, it would be really great. I could just fly over to Europe and just get a job somewhere. Not only with completely different people around me, but a just completely different culture. I could really look at myself and just you know, and change everything and I wouldn't have to tell anyone, anybody anything about me. Nothing at all. 0:18:12.4</p> Yeah, I mean I could go... in the summer of '67 I worked in Europe. And I would love to go back there just to build fences in Europe (?). I really wouldn't do it for a life's work. Boy, what a great thing to do for about a year without anyone giving a damn about whether I can swim or whether I'm a physicist. Or anything else. </p> Well yeah, self induced they're not outside, they're internal. </p> Question is though would I do that immediately and then set up new expectations. </p> You mean the expectations for myself?</p> Yeah I don't think it's as much...yeah that's probably true. Except I looked at it differently. I look at it as other people's expectations. I mean I bask in the glory I get from them. Because of the...well yeah...well it's the same thing, see I feel good when other people recognize something I've done. Therefore it's my own expectation to do something because then...it's not so much doing it, it's having it recognized.</p> Oh no. On the contrary. A lot of people are noticing. </p> Yeah.</p> Well, first of all, I've always been able to make people notice so it hasn't happened.</p> So, no, that isn't what makes me feel bad. I think what makes me feel bad...you mean the person that's talking to you right now.(inaudible/cross talk at 0:21:00.2) What makes me feel bad when I sit here and talk to you is the fact that I'm so guided by those expectations. What makes him feel bad...not a lot. 0:21:15.9</p> No, he's really reveling in his ability to con. And only on Tuesday when he thinks about what's happened all week does he...does that self lose identity and this one starts to take over and then I really start to feel bad. </p> Yeah. Well no! I don't want to live with both of them. </p> (inaudible at 0:22:31.1) would be to study up on the data for the test, and not take it. And then go out and be myself. I really feel up to it. Because that would mean that this me has taken over completely. A hundred percent. </p> I know I won't do that. Even though (inaudible at 0:22:50.2). Though I don't know. You once said the purpose of these visits may not be to change a person, but to make him more aware of why he behaves the way he does. 0:23:11.4</p> I don't know. That's what I interpreted you to say. So it doesn't matter does it, if that's what I interpret? (laughter) No, you were worried more about feelings, so a person knows why his feelings are the way they are. I think that's what you said. Whether or not you said that is neither here nor there. </p> Oh, well now there's a difference there! I remembered it as you saying ""why""</p> No, but everyone knows what his feelings are don't they? </p> Well sure. You know whether you're the best or whether you're happy or you're thinking between or whether you're proud or ashamed. </p> Oh, I see. Well...</p> Oh, I see, yeah. </p> Ok, but...Oh, that makes a whole different...that makes everything a little different. I was thinking that I was saying, ""Well, maybe I won't be able to change, but at least I'll know why I act the way I do."" But it's not a matter of why, but it's a matter of what. Not what...ah, yeah, what my feelings... I don't think there ever was a question in my mind what my feelings were. </p> I'm confused here now. I don't know what you mean by knowing what your feelings are. Do you think that I knew what my feelings were at most junctures? </p> I think we've got a semantic problem.</p> Well I just...to not know what one's feelings are is sort of a contradiction in terms. Because feelings, it just implies sense. It's what you...it's how you react to something, how you feel about something. </p> Ok, I see what you mean. But I don't think that's my problem. Because I can look at any given situation you know, that happens during the weekend and I can come in on Wednesday and I figure it out. What my feelings were.</p> Oh, I see. Not realizing that feeling in me. </p> Oh, ok. That's because I had separated two completely different people, separated into two completely different people. And that person didn't feel that way. </p> So all I have to do is carry a picture of you around and whenever I start to feel like I'm slipping, I can say, ""Well, there she is, she's watching.""</p> Yeah, pretty much. Unfortunately I could forget about you very easily. </p> That's not a bad thought though; just to...I think it would be possible, maybe at any given point, you know the major things I did this weekend. I changed my style of dress, my appearance, my behavior with this girl, I changed everything. But I think that in going just generally through day to day existence, that there wouldn't be as many drastic things that I'd have to do...to, that I would have to not do to be honest with you, to not put you in the drawer. Well, that's basically how I do things. </p> Well, if I can get one step past the door today and remember to not put you in the drawer and think, ""how am I behaving now, is this really honest?"" I'm fine. Certainly if I've got one step, there's no way in the world I can't take two steps. And that's the whole thing, I'll be coming back in two weeks and here I'll be all set. </p> Yeah, not necessarily doing it (inaudible at 0:30:36.6) but doing it by actions. You know, is this action honest? </p> I don't see enough of them anyhow, so it doesn't really bother me. I think I could do that. Now, had I gone with that procedure this weekend, number one I wouldn't have gotten any money from the city of New York...</p> Not right now I wouldn't, no. Not talking to you I wouldn't be sorry at all. I think by the time I got to the third step outside the door I'd be sorry though. </p> Well...let me think. </p> Yeah, whether it was...you know...</p> Yeah, that self, yeah.</p> Well, yeah. Well, let's skip that. Had I...well alright. I could've done that. Probably. But there was no hesitation in my mind at all. When I decided what I had to do. I hadn't worn that suit in three years. A brown suit...with a white shirt! Wow! Amazing! And wing-tipped shoes. It was just unbelievable. That's like the old standard clich� of what the business man looks like. 0:33:28.1</p> Yeah. Although...yeah, that's pretty much it. There were times though when I would stay on track for a week. I was coming two times a week too at that time. Those were more volatile days. Self wise. Figuring things out (inaudible at 0:34:34.0) settling down.</p> Well, the thing going on...had I not behaved that well with the mayor then I would have gone to...back home and might have behaved...I certainly would have behaved differently. 0:34:57.0</p> Alright, well you know first of all, I would have had a hell of a lot of skeptical little glances around before I talked. </p> Oh no, no indeed. No. As a matter of fact I was looking forward to going back there and...I think it's a good point you brought this up. Here's what I had in the back of my head, although I didn't really say ""alright, here's number one that's going to happen, then number two..."" This is what I think now; here talking to you, is what was in my head. I kind of had the idea that I would go back there and look quite a bit different than they had anticipated. And the thing before anybody had introduced me or anything to talk to the kiddies they would have been very skeptical about my being there. 0:36:08.5</p> Yeah. It is, it was. And I don't think that's bad,</p> No, I don't think that's bad. I was hoping...I think that what I was fostering was a little bit of dependence. But I went back there being...fitting right back into their stereotype about what the successful high school graduate does. 0:37:33.2</p> Yeah, the...you know...so that's...and the third thing that would have happened had I behaved honestly, like I don't know if I could have, I cannot behave on a one to one relationship with a person I don't think, with new person honestly, very easily. </p> Yeah, it's kind of funny the minute I get up you know like past oh 500 people I'm great. It's just as long as there's no one to one stuff. 0:38:21.9</p> I'm protected pretty much. When it gets up to bigger numbers. </p> No one's going to get inside me. There's no way there's going to be any personal interaction. </p> No probing at all. There can be no probing, of course. I mean...</p> Right, anywhere from 10 people up. In your actions, there's no way in the world anyone's going to get (inaudible at 0:38:53.1) if you're careful, deeply inside you. </p> So, then when I got back here...well...yeah, it's sad but true and that seems to be the case. </p> Yeah, I'm much better with groups of people. </p> That's not myself, that's the point. </p> I don't think...</p> Well, you see, when you're with one person you have to be careful to react...let's say more on the standard of the other person, ok? Outside of the norm. When you're with one person you have to be careful to react to things as he wants you to react to them. And it's quite hard, because you have to feel out at any given point, how he's feeling, and how he's reacting in order for you to behave in a way conducive with his reaction. </p> I really feel like Dick Nixon. That he seems to be that kind of person. That can just...which is disgusting because if there's nothing I revile... he seems to be the type, that type to me and that's the type that I just don't want to be? The type that will just take...of course he doesn't know it...and maybe that's on scale. It just takes, what is it, 28 million people and tries to see what 51 percent of them will want...will feel like. And he behaves that way and I do the same thing only...(inaudible/crosstalk at 0:41:48.3)</p> (inaudible at 0:42:03.8)Yeah, maybe we better leave it as two people and that disgusts me, the person you're talking to but that person out there doesn't know (inaudible at 0:42:06.6) very well...</p> Well, if I completely divorce myself from that person...</p> ...it's a way to do things. It's a way to achieve recognition. And it's a way to...yeah, to get somewhere. It's clear. </p> Yeah, I mean...if you've got a million people that are just...that you've projected a certain image to and that image you've projected is pleasing to them well it can't hurt you. I mean, that person someday is going to be is some position to do you a favor. </p> Sure. Sure.</p> Does he feel proud...</p> Sure, sure. </p> I can try. </p> It's not so much that he's stronger; I have this lofty thing about myself. That anything I set out to do, I can do. If I set out to be honest I could do it. Either me that's talking to you know or that person could do it very easily. I think. I mean all these ridiculous goals that I have. </p> Yeah. You see the point is other people would say, ""alright it's impossible for somebody to look at somebody and say it's certainly maybe impossible for some person to do something on the initial try."" But you see everyone can...I think that most anyone could do most anything. 0:44:55.9</p> Yeah, I mean, well that's not so much me that's just other people not realizing what they have to do to do something. I mean I'm not saying now that I'm any great shakes, it's (inaudible at 0:45:25.0)</p> Sure. </p> Yeah, what should be the supreme, the pinnacle, someone not...someone...well like a cripple climbing Mount Everest. (inaudible at 0:45:45.5) or something like that. </p> Technically it's possible. </p> There was another point I was going to make (inaudible at 0:46:02.3). Yeah, I might as well...that, that's...another way to look at it...I might as well just decide that this person and that person are just going to set that as a goal. 0:46:23.9</p> I've been ready to for a long time. </p> the point is he would have to blow everything else, you see. All lot of other stuff would have to go out the window. </p> It's going to be a fight! I can see it in the offing. Yeah, he doesn't like that at all.</p> Well, let's see. He says, ""out of sight, out of mind."" You know, that there's no way in the world that I can put you in a drawer very easily. At any given point it's going to be very, very easy to forget what goes on here. Yeah. I see a tremendous battle. It would take a tremendous presence of mind for me to win. I mean I would have to be thinking all the time about how I'm acting. I mean really thinking about it. 0:47:46.9</p> Yeah, all he has to do is get too busy with whatever is going on around. </p> Or too busy or too...or simply it becomes too hard to do. To be honest. Which is...could easily be the case with parents or something like that. </p> Yeah, it'd be an interesting fight. The point is...there's another point though that...the fight will take on completely new dimensions, in June; you know when the test is over. I mean it will really become a battleground; it's sort of like small skirmishes now. (inaudible at 0:49:18.1) </p> Well, I was talking in analogies. I've been trying to avoid it as much as possible. </p> Why? Because it's...I think it gets pretty old hatish. I mean when I used to write papers in school, everyone would be an analogy. And they worked, on occasion. But they get very...old, very easily. </p> Well I just hope that...why they're handy though aren't they? There are times when it's easier to talk in analogies than it is to...use the right words. The words that mean what you're talking about. Because an analogy...well they mean the same thing but...well no...I just don't know if everyone else thinks in analogy as much as I do. </p> Well, I'm just avoiding them because I don't want to...well you probably...see you probably have the words that go with everything, just because you've done so much work in the field. But I just don't have the words.</p> Well, I hope I'm not confusing you. I don't know. I'm not confusing, that's not the right word.</p> Oh it doesn't...what does it matter? What...so I use analogies. That's no big deal. All right, I'll use this analogy. Yeah, basically what happened was I realized I was using them so much that it became...in my speech and writing it just became, you know, that was me. So...which is sort of a crutch, is what it is. And I don't like to fall back on a crutch. And you know one should be able to express one's self without having to.</p> I don't know. I don't know if it's variety as much as it is...uh...yeah pretty...yeah variety. A person should not use the same method to express one's self. But you just can't express yourself correctly if you use the same thing all the time. 0:51:42.7</p> Yeah. Just like...well anything would be limiting that you use too much of. There clearly is a case where an analogy is going to break down. Every analogy is going to break down somewhere. </p> Right. But I don't think that's a major issue... (inaudible at 0:52:03.4) has much to do with myself other than it's just a little quirk of the way I talk. I think.</p> Yeah...I'll have to admit I...(inaudible at 0:52:43.7)...'cause the last couple of times I've really felt bad. I won't put you out of sight, out of mind though. I'll keep... </p> Well I...the point is...that there have been times as I have said before, when I come in here really fired up, you know, and felt good about things, and other times...I mean today wasn't a joyful session; I mean there isn't a lot of happy stuff to say about myself...(inaudible at 0:53:13.4) I think I've discovered that made me pleased (ph?) and the last couple of times have been that way, bad ways. And...</p> Right. And I know that between now and...Well I guess it is three weeks, three weeks from now when I come back that...that I'm not going to have much time to do anything but sit in my room and study and then go take the test. So that there's nothing of any real consequence going to happen...that's going to change...</p> No I don't think so. And nor is there going to be anything very encouraging. However...then when it's all over with I'll probably see more people in that next week than I've seen you know in the last six months. And it'll be interesting to see what happens. Good old honest me. I hope anyway. 0:54:18.6</p> Oh there's no question in the world that...this is the biggest juncture in my life so far! The biggest turning point. If I pass it, it's all down hill. And if I don't pass it things are really going to get goofed up. Well, not necessarily goofed up, but changed around. New directions. </p> I mean we went through that what, three sessions ago, or something? Why I handle it the way I do. And in the end it's pretty clear. There's no question. They just decided they just did it that way and that's the way I did it. </p> Yeah, well there's nothing else to pick up. (inaudible at 0:56:35.3)</p> Yeah...it was a pretty unimaginative... (inaudible at 0:56:50.0) to raise kids. </p> Well...yeah...(inaudible at 0:56:58.2) a good thing (inaudible-background noise) I just thought about it...for years and years and years the most important thing for me was being a great dad, being a (inaudible at 0:57:06.1) it hasn't yet. And now that's really hidden so far back in my mind I could care less, I really could care less. I don't know whether it's...the idea that...I'm really disgusted with the world (inaudible at 0:57:22.6). I don't think it's that so much as it's the fact that back then when I thought that way I thought my parents had done a great job. And now I realize what a poor job they've done and I'm here doing the same thing. 0:57:39.9</p>",2
1004538634.txt,"Hi. Whoo - It's so nice out. I feel so bad for those poor marathoners today. It's gonna be awful.</p> Oh, really?</p> Oh my God, well the problem is with the training, like, none of them have been training in this. Oh my gosh.</p> That's true.</p> No. My mom texted me this morning saying ""So happy I'm not running this year."" I don't blame her. (laughter) It would be awful. Although it (unintelligible) (laughter)</p> Yes. Very much so. Her job is she's running a research study currently and I feel like since that's kind of her job to collect data information and then analyze it and put it to some use, I feel like she does that with her children as well and it's, like, for a lot of stuff I just don't know. And Hetty, the baby, doesn't know - and you - none of us know. Like, she doesn't want to poop in her diaper because, er, in the potty 'cause that's scary and it's new and like nothing has changed about that (chuckles) from last night when I saw you. So I just don't know what else to do. Like she's gonna get it one day. My whole thing is like she's just gonna get it. Like one day, she's gonna be more comfortable with it. She'll have a lot of accidents and one day, just like every other kid, it's not gonna be as scary anymore. She's just gonna go. Like, I don't know, like for me, that's my kind of attitude about it and, like, we can do everything we want. We can incentivize, we can, you know, distract her, we can give her toys to put, you know, we can do the whole thing. But outside of that, like, we have no control. They're her bowels. She's gonna do - like, I just don't have - I know, here I am talking about it I'm so focused on this kid's bowels. (chuckles) Um, anyway, so I get, I think she can read my lack of patience. Maybe she can't, but I feel like she can. And then I always feel like, and then I beat myself up with ""you need to be more patient"" ""you need to like let her - this is her kid."" [00:10:00]</p> Because I get frustrated when I get there in the morning and they haven't done it the way that I want them to do it. Like, why would you - I get pissed - like the morning that I got there and Hetty was refusing to put on underpants, so they just put a diaper on her. And it's like, well, yeah, she's gonna do that. I don't think force underpants on the kid, but you're the one. If you, you know, it was their idea. They wanted to start the potty training. I didn't really think Hetty was ready, but they wanted to do it. And so now I'm the one at home all day long because we, those few days, wouldn't leave the house because she would just pee in the - you know. So I'm the one at home all day with her sitting there. It's like just don't you just showed her that she wins. If she, like, screams and cries and throws a tantrum and then you put the diaper on her, you're just setting that situation up to happen every day now. And so then I get irritated and, and, like, I wouldn't have done it that way - so you did it the wrong way. And so then I, like, you know, usually I come in and I sit with - they're all eating breakfast usually - and so I sit down and I like chat with them but then those mornings when it's like, ""Ugh, why'd you mess that up?"" I just get, I'm like (cheerful voice) ""OK, sounds good!"" and then I just busy myself with things around the house, laundry or cleaning up or dishes or something and it's obvious that I'm frustrated.</p> And then it's, I don't know (sigh), and it's like why am I frustrated? Why do I care that much that they've set up a situation for them and their kid. I don't know.</p> I do care. I care because I care about Hetty and I care about the work that I've put in with her for, you know, like saying only I've told her for days diapers are only in the crib. And I've told them that over and over and I've said like Hetty and I have conversations about it and we say ""Oh, diapers only in the crib"" and when we say bye-bye to the crib, we say bye-bye to diapers. And so now, like, everything that I've said to her and that she understands is void because mommy and daddy don't, you know, 'cause now ""I'm wearing a diaper."" ""I'm out of my crib, but here I am wearing my diaper 'cause I screamed and cried."" (chuckles) And I just get like arghhh. Anyway, I don't know. (pause) It was a long week last week. (chuckles) I was feeling really frustrated.</p> Yeah, well, or when I feel like I'm the only, like, ""We're ready to do this. We want to do this,"" but what they mean is ""We want you to do this."" And it's like, well, then if you're gonna want me to do it then these three hours you see her awake I need you to do these things that we've set up for these three hours that you have her. Do you know what I mean? It's like if you can't do that then I can't do what you've asked me to do the other 10 hours. I don't know what else to do. (chuckles)</p> Not intentionally. And then I feel like when I draw their attention to that I feel like I hurt their feelings 'cause I don't think they mean to, but that's the other thing. I don't think they mean to do these things. That's not their personality. They're not, like, intentionally trying to undermine me. They're not intentionally - they're just afraid of making their kids upset. They always have been and I know that about them, but the kids are gonna get upset no matter what, no matter if it's you or me or whoever it is so the thing that hasn't kicked in with them in the last three years (chuckles) is that, like, by you taking the easy road and fixing whatever it is that needs to get done and making them not upset, I'm the one who always has to go back and kind of like clean it up and has to be the bad guy and has to say like ""No, you can't, like, wear your nightgown outside again 'cause it's disgusting and dirty and, like, we need to wash it 'cause it's laundry day."" It's things like that. And I'm the one who always has to say ""no"", and it really bothers me. (chuckles) [00:14:43]</p> Yeah, and, like, yeah. I guess that is. And that's my impulse. My impulse is to say like ""This is what would be wrong with that."" My impulse is to always say like ""Well, I see the flaw and the flaw is here."" A lot of times with kids, like, you just need to let the situation play out and it's harder for me with other parents being the ones with control, allowing them to let it play out how they want to, 'cause I let it play out a different way. It's not, I don't know. (pause) (sigh) [00:15:45]</p> Oh, yeah. I don't want to leave her, but I do want to leave this situation because it's not something that makes me happy anymore. I'm always happy to see. . this is kind of terrible. Sadie, the older one and I, don't have the same relationship that I have with the baby, and I don't feel that excitement that I feel when I see her - that I have when I see Hetty. And I have a lot of guilt about that. I feel really guilty about that. And I feel, like I wonder a lot of times like did I damage this kid by not, like I love her because I've been taking care of her for the last three years almost. But there are parts of her personality that really irritate me and I see a lot of her similarities. [00:18:38]</p> Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I have all this, you know, it comes across as really harsh though because I'm saying like, ""No, you're a big girl. You can say hello when somebody says 'hello' to you. You can say 'hello' back."" And I say all these things that sound really harsh when I say them out loud to her. I think like ""Why did I just say that?"" Like if she doesn't want to say 'hello' then she doesn't have to say 'hello' to that person. You shouldn't push a kid to be social if they're not. But then I have this other - I don't think there's a right answer - but then I think, like, she's 41/2 and she should, like, it's proper social favor to like if somebody says 'hello' to you she can say 'hello' back. So then I beat myself up because I'm just not letting this kid ""be"". Just let her be. And, um, I don't know. [00:20:26]</p> I'm trying to permanently undo mess-up (chuckles). Change that. Undo permanent mess-ups. Or trying to - do you mean by the job? Doing the job? [00:21:45]</p> Yeah, I feel like I have done permanent damage to myself and I'm trying to undo it or to make it better. (sigh)</p> In terms of the job or just my life?</p> Just beating myself up and not letting myself be (pause), like just happy for what I have or, I don't know. Always being more concerned with what's going on with other people than what's going on with myself. I feel like just setting up that mentality. I feel like getting into certain patterns of behavior that I don't like. (pause) Yeah, just setting up certain ways of being that are like, well, that's not a healthy way to live and to let's backtrack and let's fix that. (pause) So I feel like those are kind of the ways, I guess, that I've maybe really damaged myself permanently. (pause) [00:23:27]</p> I dunno. Great question. (chuckles) But now I'm just kinda like, oh, like it doesn't hurt my stomach. My stomach's fine. I'm not having reflux and that's kind of the goal and so ""ehh"". (verbal shrug) No big deal. Have a couple beers. But I'm pissed at myself because I wanted to do this the right way and now I'm, like, now I'm pissed 'cause I (pause) like didn't do it the right way, they way it was supposed to be done, the whole seven weeks. Go to the doctor and say like, ""I didn't do it these whole seven weeks."" (pause)</p> Hunh</p> It's huge, yeah. And then, ya know, because I didn't do it the right way . . and that's what always . . 'cause it just feels like I can't follow through with anything and I just have no follow through. Like I can't even take care of my body. You know, it goes along with that whole other thing. It's like I'm not taking care of my body well and I'm not like . . (sigh) (pause)</p> Yeah, 'cause it's like I have all these other things that I'm frustrated about that I complain about but then what is this? I say that I'm upset because I'm not losing weight, but then drinking beers at a baseball game isn't gonna help that and, you know, (pause) I don't know. And I know I have to, like, let myself live a little. I know that I can't be this rigid. (trails off) But at the same time, like, which is it? Do you want to take care of yourself or do you wanna just do whatever you want? And I know it's not that black and white. And I know there's shades in between there, that there's a very happy meeting place, but it just doesn't feel like that a lot of times. [00:28:50]</p> I think that I always only see the negative and that I only always - unless I'm not doing everything exactly perfectly right, like eating oatmeal for breakfast and greens the rest of the day - then I'm in a bad place and I don't, like, I'll just pick apart the fact that, like, ""oh, and then you had like mac & cheese for lunch with the girls"". And then you, like, you know, I'll just pick apart all these little things instead of focusing on ""well, I did a good job the rest of the time"" and that these other things happened and that even though maybe I had a few beers this weekend I still didn't drink for five weeks which, I'm sure, gave my stomach plenty of time to heal. You know, it's not like I went on a bender (chuckles) and like lost, I don't know. But it feels like it. It feels like I might as well have just gone on a bender and lost total control because I'm beating myself up the same. [00:30:00]</p> Overly indulgent.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Right.</p> Right. And that is hard for me. And then I find myself being not indulgent at all with them, like, you know, we'll have treats and lots of things like that and we have fun but I'm strict. I feel like I have to counteract. And that's how it is. I'm with them the same way I am with myself, which makes me very nervous about happens to my own kids because I don't treat myself very great. And if I'm gonna treat children the way I treat myself, that's not a good thing. That's not OK. And it's a huge part of me being here. It's that I'm not gonna treat, here I am saying I treat these other children like I treat myself and I hate it, but like I'm not gonna raise my own children and treat them this way because it's totally unacceptable. [00:31:14]</p> Oh, I love them. I mean, I absolutely love them, but I know I could do better. And you know a lot of times I just feel worn out. I've been doing this for almost 10 years. These aren't the first kids I've watched. These are, I feel really close to the finish line, and a lot of times I just feel like I'm over this and it's not fair to them (pause) cause I just don't, I mean, I used to be so much more fun. (chuckles) And I just don't wanna, I'm really afraid that I've used up all my best kid energy on 10 years of kids that weren't mine, and whenever we do have kids that I'm gonna be over it and I'm kinda terrified. [00:32:42]</p> Yeah, that I'm gonna be like, that I have, that I'll have these, because I've done especially the toddlers, like I've done the toddler's age for a different toddler for the last 10 years. I mean and so I feel like, yeah, I'll just be like kind of ""how do you not get this - come on"". 'Cause in my head, like, I've been doing this over and over. I mean I'm not afraid that I'm gonna be neglectful or abusive or anything like that but I feel like I'll be so bored that it'll come off as, like I don't wanna be bored with my own kid. That's a huge fear. I don't wanna sit there & be like thinking how dull this is and how ""over it"" I am.</p> Yeah, and not having this, like, profound connection that you hear about everybody having, but then I'll be like, well, is everybody saying that because they've just never seen a child grow and develop? You know, been with a kid? I dunno. (pause) Yeah, I have a lot of fear about it. I mean no matter what, I know that I'm not gonna be a terrible parent, like, it's definitely within the realm of possibility, but I don't think that I'm going to be and I just want to be engaged and be ""into it"", just really ""into it"". I don't feel really ""into"" my job right now, and it feels like that's all it's gonna be.</p> I know that these aren't my children, but if I feel right now how I feel about my own kids, I'm going to be really unhappy. [00:35:00]</p> Right. But it hasn't been for the last year. You mean in the sense like I've always known I'm leaving?</p> Uh-huh. I mean I felt disconnected and like ""I can't wait for this to be over for over a year. I've just gotta get through this next year."" That's not a good feeling.</p> Because of that and just because I'm tired of being, I'm isolated, I feel alone, I feel like I don't, I'm just tired of taking care of other people's children. I feel like all I do is take care of people, and this has no long-term payoff. I mean, like this is short term, like I'm putting in a lot of work for these kids and sometimes it's hard at the end of the day when I leave and I realize like this has no long-term payout (chuckles) and that's a terrible thing to think as a nanny. That's terrible. Because it does. It has long-term payoff for those kids but not if I'm doing it wrong, first of all, and not for me, and that's awful. But it gets tiring and I want a little bit of a break. [00:36:43]</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yep.</p> Uh-huh. I'm pouring energy into it. I'm pouring energy into everyone in my life and I feel like there's nothing, I'm not getting anywhere.</p> Oh, I'm exhausted.</p> Oh, yeah.</p> Yeah. I mean, I'm nervous about (pause) a lot of things. Change is hard for me. I have a really hard time with just adjusting. I had a really hard time when we moved here. It's when my anxiety all started, at least my panic attacks started. And I'm really nervous that that's gonna happen again - really nervous. (pause) [00:38:05]</p> (sigh) I was thinking that even if we were going back to California I know I'd still have all these same feelings. I'd still be thinking like he's already made the decision. I'd still have a lot of fear, and I think the reason that I'm so into the idea of going back to California is that because I have this whole idea of California that doesn't exist anymore. You know, a lot of our friends have left. I have this idea of how it was when we were 21, 22, 23. I can remember restaurant jobs and we were going out every night and, like, having a blast and everyone living together and that just doesn't exist anymore. I have this image in my head of California and it's like fun, everybody's hanging out, and that isn't there. And that wouldn't be there because logically that's just not the phase of our lives we're in anymore. And so I have to also let go of that. [00:43:34]</p> Good question. (pause) Wherever. I don't know. Wherever the old bad stuff went.</p> It just goes, or comes. I just don't want to move there and be depressed.</p> Hmmm. (pause)</p> She saw better things. I love New Hampshire, but I know I'm happier away from my family. (pause) So, I don't know. (pause) I don't know. (yawn) I mean it's not that bad. I feel like I'm making it way too big a deal out of this. I've moved before, it's not . .</p> I know. Yeah, it is. I mean that's totally (chuckles) 'cause I can talk myself out of either side of it and so, unless I'm getting like harsh, I know I can talk myself out of either side. So.</p> That's true.</p> OK. Great.</p>",2
1004538620.txt,"This is always so weird trying to figure out what to talk about. (laughs) This is very hard for me to talk about myself like, ya know, a couple hours a week, ya know? But, I went home...</p> It still is, yeah. I have to force myself to do it. I get myself into a mindset for it.</p> Sometimes it's because of the fact that I don't really feel like there's anything immediately to talk about.</p> I don't really know what it is. So, I mean there's times like when okay, so I have something I need to talk about. But most of the time it's just the getting in the gear of talking about somebody besides myself. Especially Tuesday afternoons since I've been so focused on other people.</p> And so...you would think that the hour long commute back would like fix that, but no, so (pause), But, um, yeah so um, I went home. It was good.</p> Um, of course (chuckles) um, I'm a worrier. I'm an only child. Ya know, my parents are getting up there and so like oh my God. They were like...they don't have a doorknob on the front door and this and that, and so I'm like (pause) I have lots of worries about them and things like that. Not so much immediately now but like as in later, ya know? But, that's, um...it's not entirely unfounded. I come from a family that doesn't really understand boundaries when it comes to work and overdoing it, and so I've got very valid reasons to be worried about them, ya know. My dad was up at 4:30, 5:00 a.m. like the whole time I was there, ya know getting work done and that kind of stuff. So it's not like it's (pause) for no good reason...</p> So, but I just...like I said I'm concerned about them.</p> So (pause). But there's not anything I can do about it so all I can do is tell 'em my opinion and hope they take it to heart and sort of let go.</p> And worry a little bit.</p> So (pause) but (pause).</p> Oh, I'm sure they do. They do. They just, um...I don't think they...in fact I know for a fact I've gone out of my way to make sure that they do not know a whole lot about what's going on with me. I mean I talk to them all the time. They don't know that I'm depressed. They don't...they know nothing about Mike's problems. They know that Mike has problems with depression, but they don't know anything about that kind of stuff. They know his family is crazy. They don't understand how crazy, ya know? It's better that way because it's something that they can't conceptualize. Like they don't understand that and so what happens is it becomes asking lots and lots of questions. And I've done this before of talking to them about my problems and they'll just think that I'm coming to ask them for advice. And like I'm not asking for advice. There's nothing that you can do.</p> Ya know? And so I pretty much don't. Plus my dad worries too much as is, ya know, about life, so he doesn't need to worry about me.</p> But, ya know, my mom is like have you thought about this? Have you thought about that? And like mom I assure you, you raised me, I've thought of every angle...</p> ...and every backup and even if this thing has changed, trust me, ya know?</p> It's not...and so it's not like I'm going out of my way to lie to them per se as much as, um, just not telling them what's going on? Because it's just something that would bother them anyways?</p> So. They know I'm not thrilled with being up here.</p> Um, they (pause) almost believe me when I tell them that we're not moving back, ya know. And so, um, I don't know. So. It's, it can be kind of rough, ya know. Cuz they are getting older. Um, my dad still thinks he fully intends never to truly retire, so...and that's just...it's very common with accountants.</p> They just...I mean you just start being more selective in terms of your clients. Who you will and will not take. He never...I mean that just means you only bill 40 hours a week...</p> ...as a retirement job.</p> That's part time. Billing. Billing isn't the same thing as actual doing either.</p> (Laughs) But, um, yeah it's unfortunately kind of normal.</p> So. I went back to my old store. I got to see a couple of people I really miss, which was good.</p> Um, one of them wants to come work up here potentially and so I'm going to see what I can do to get him a position up in Salem. That was kinda nice. It was nice to have people recognize me who worked for me.</p> So. Went to visit some friends, ya know. Saw campus. That kind of thing.</p> Yeah, carnival. Mm hmm. That's when I do all the whole buggy things and robots...basically it's more or less showcase...they build a lot of stuff some of which are not really engineering feats as much as can you believe this was made with plywood and it's actually kind of safe? But, um, it's basically, it's a lot of construction of stuff. Whether it be robots, whether it be, um, um, ya know. When I say the word buggy, I'm going to bring a picture up because it's very hard for people to understand this. Um, they're very small vehicles that actually have human beings in them that are usually...these days they do it, um, it's usually like made of, um, like fiberglass - single crystal cast fiberglass—</p> ...but they're very, very aerodynamic. I'm gonna find some pictures here of them. Yeah! There's a human being in that.</p> That's a side thing from it.</p> It's something...well it's a, um...it's basically more or less kind of like a soap box derby but it's done at a much more extreme level. There's an area that has like this curve and a round part to it and it's pushed up a hill for part of it. It only makes right turns - I mean that's a human being in there like steering. That's why short women are very, very prized at the university.</p> Yeah. But yeah, that's kind of a big deal.</p> It's weird that they have like all this tech stuff like showing it up there because like the top 10 boards because for years this was the top 10 boards. Now they have like this digital thing so you can see how the leaders are doing.</p> So, it's kinda weird. But, um, yeah, that's one of the big things is buggy. Um, just sorta like Nascar slash soap box derby.</p> But it's done on a level that is completely insane. Like usually there's a vacuum. You mainly make these things as it's made with vacuum and fiberglass and it's all made as one big piece. It's one crystal.</p> Yeah. It's really...</p> Super aerodynamic. Super light cuz you have to have pushing teams for it.</p> It has to make a...it has to make a hairpin turn. It only...they only can...they can only turn right. It's, it's not possible to do anything else. There's no left turns in the whole thing.</p> But they have this hairpin turn which is well known for like crashing out on it and all that stuff, so it's kind of a big deal for there. So the um...so it was nice to...I didn't make it for any of the buggy except for the final trials. It starts at like five in the morning.</p> Because they have to shut down streets. It's sort of insane. So, there's that kind of stuff. And visited some friends and that kind of thing. So it was nice.</p> Yeah. Mike got to meet with some of his advisors and all the people...</p> ...he really respects their opinion, and that's good. He may have a collaboration going where maybe he can go home every few weeks.</p> We'll see. I'm pushing towards this.</p> Um, whether or not it's paid for doesn't matter to me. It's just like an excuse to be there so that it's not time off.</p> Does that make sense? It's like working there for, ya know, a week every so often, which would be nice.</p> Um...really that's the fairly really big things that are going on. Um, we did that. We drove back. It's been sort of sleeping and just sort of recovering. Um (pause) that's pretty much...sorting through my old stuff. Every time I go there I go through a little bit more of it and it's really hard for me cuz it's like a lot of things I want to toss. Some things I don't. It just...I can't believe that I have accumulated so many things over my life (chuckles). Most of it's back there. So, ya know. But, um, that kind of thing. Yeah. But, there's like I said it's been kinda stressful but. Mike really likes my parents but after a while they drive him up the wall. They drive me up the wall after a while too. They have just very different lifestyles. They like...they like more noise than we do. Which is probably the nicest understatement of the year.</p> So, um...like I quite literally...and this is part of...I don't know how to explain this. I have what has been discussed as a very, very mild amount of attention deficit disorder. I have got ritualistic things in place so that it doesn't even matter any more. But like as a kid hearing the TV and trying to do homework at the same time—can't do that. I actually can't drive and listen - I almost never drive any more - but I can't drive and listen to the radio if it's like a talk show or anything like that at the same time either. I cannot have multiple forms of input. It's very difficult for me. And so although I wasn't doing any tasks where I had to, it still reminded me of the fact that I'm hearing all this stuff going on all the time.</p> I was specifically told at one point that I might have. Because I don't have hyperactivity and because I'm intelligent and a female it possibly was not actually ever diagnosed.</p> Not as much as spacey as much as just like, ya know...I was very good at faking like being attentive when I wasn't.</p> But I guess sometimes with multiple input sources it's just more than I can handle.</p> And actually it depends on what it is. Um, I still get that way if I'm in like a Wal-Mart when it's crazy. I can...if there's just too much stuff going on it really does. But for the most part I like have these ritualistic things where okay so it's time for me to do...and, and in school I did this. Like I probably didn't actually have to wear my glasses, but I was wearing my glasses when it was time to focus. Ya know. I'd sit down. I'd have like everything in front of me. I had enough pencil and paper. And it was very ritualistic, so this is the time for me to do this.</p> And even now with certain things I will do that for anything else that's very detailed oriented. Which is very little of my life. But there are a few things that have to be very specifically, and so I have ways that I make sure that I'm prepared for that, ya know? But my parents' house is noisier than that. First of all they've got two enormous dogs who...one of which who every time a hair falls in his face like literally thinks something else is happening. It's really dumb. But, ya know, just in general the house is noisier than us, um, which is kind of, ya know, hard to handle. My parents are also just talkers.</p> They want to talk. They don't ever like to have quiet silence that much.</p> And so, um, it bothers me a little bit. It drives Mike up the wall. Like the fact that they're like oh, so, so what ya doing? He's like I'm working right now. Do you see I'm in front of the laptop? I've got like, ya know...this is actually like (inaudible at 00:13:28) and sarcastic thing to me. He's like I got (inaudible at 00:13:31) in front of me. It looks like I'm workin'. I'm workin.'</p> And she's like yeah, I'm not like...ya know she'll just ask about things, cuz she's just...like she shouldn't walk by him without making conversation.</p> He's a guest, ya know.</p> And so that kind of stuff really drives him crazy, um, and so I think he was...we went home a day early and I think he was really happy for that. Not a day early, only like 12 hours early.</p> So, um, so we did that and just got a lot of things accomplished that I was really pleased with. Not as much as I'd hoped but got a lot more accomplished than I thought I was going to. Which is good. Um (pause) so that was definitely helpful. Um (sighs). It's just definitely interesting to remember how different my life used to be, ya know? Um...</p> Well, just, just, ya know, being confronted with all the things that I have and did have. I'm very much into not owning anything more than I can...I mean at this point right now it's still taking forever to pack and move things, and I feel like I still have a lot of stuff. But boy I own a lot more stuff than that from like my life previously, ya know?</p> And how much I don't see...like don't want to waste things. I'd rather repair than rebuy or, ya know, do something to put it back, that kind of thing. And so, um, like I said it's a very different world, um, ya know, in terms of that. Um, I don't know. I just (pause) lighter, happier, that kind of thing.</p> It depends. I mean I miss it a little bit. But when I was living there...so like I was living in Cincinnati not at my parents' house it was still different</p> And more like being, ya know, confronted with all the stuff from my teenage years...</p> ...and probably the twenties, things like that. My life is never gonna be like that again, ya know?</p> So. Not, like I said a lot lighter, a lot happier. So. Um (pause) I think that they were pretty distressed at seeing how hard it was for me to get around sometimes.</p> And I think it's really upsetting to them that they can't do a thing about it. So (pause) my dog was really happy to be there. The dog thinks my parents are the best thing in the world.</p> I don't know what they do when I'm not around but I'm sure she eats steak or something...</p> ...I don't know. But um, but she was pretty thrilled, ya know...</p> ...to be there but it's just (pause) (sighs)...it took me a while to really want to go out and about and face the world while I was there, though? I really wanted to stay in the house. I don't really know why. Maybe it was because of the fact I didn't want to be kinda down and then run into people I know like I had...</p> ...ya know to go out to get some things fixed and all the stuff and I didn't want to kind of be around, like be kinda like in a bad place when that happened.</p> So it took me a while to really feel comfortable doing that, which is hard to explain, but yeah, I sort of had to get decompressed before I felt comfortable doing that.</p> And, um (pause) I don't know. I guess I was just kind of (pause) having a spell (inaudible at 00:17:46) for a little bit. I would never be that way any more, though, cuz I will never be, ya know, 19 any more or, ya know, 22 any more or anything like that but...</p> Well, you're happier. Just in general younger, having more energy, more anything, ya know?</p> Life is less complicated, healthier, ya know.</p> I in general spend a lot of time wishing that I were younger, so...</p> Yeah.</p> So. It is sort of, uh, goes with the...I am surrounded by people who are much younger than me.</p> So (pause)...</p> Oh yeah, younger. Definitely younger. Yeah. I don't even like to think about how old I am right now. I was telling my husband the other day that basically that, ya know, coming up on this next birthday is actually older than I ever imagined myself to be. Ever. And so not like as in like I thought my life would just cut off or like I'd die or something like that.</p> Yup. So, it's kind of a weird thing but (pause)...</p> Yeah. It's energy. It's...ya know, it's everything. It's attractiveness. It's, ya know, it's everything. I mean (sighs) (pause) I remember turning I think it was like 20 or something like that and thinking to myself pretty much that there wasn't any, ya know basically there wasn't anything that I wanted or could achieve that could really be any better than this and so I just didn't want to get any...I mean I was like this well long time I never wanted to get any older. I started seeing like the dermatologist at like 22.</p> So I've always been like that. It's physical. It's (pause) everything. And so, um, yeah (pause). It's sort of a weird thing but it's part of who I am. I just don't like being older.</p> Being old. Feeling old. And, um, (pause) it's not that I really...it's hard to explain because I'm not entirely certain if I want to be young, like young now, as much as I wish that things would just be different, like they used to be I guess. So I really don't want to spend a whole lot of time on Facebook or like other things that are very popular now even...</p> ...so much, but like I think I'm probably the only person in the entire world who feels like I misspent my youth by spending all this time like in academia and not having a good time, ya know.</p> A little bit, or at least more adventurous, so (pause)...back when, ya know, I felt like that, ya know. And, um (pause) I...I always thought that there would be time for that kind of stuff and then by the time that there was, it, ya know, not so much, ya know?</p> Probably. I think so. I mean there's lots of times that have sort of gotten away, ya know? (pause) The thing that's even weirder is that I was...I think that part of the reason why I feel so much regret is because of the fact that I did actually have a lot of fun and a lot of good times but like I guess I've always been expecting more. We were having dinner with some friends of ours that we knew in graduate school and we were just telling stories about undergraduate and they were like well, I don't have stories like that. I have no stories like, ya know. I have exactly zero stories like that, ya know, and things like that, but I guess it's cuz of the fact that I had such a high expectation of things, ya know, that (pause) I don't know.</p> Oh gosh. Um (pause) there's just (pause) there's just a million just little things from day to day that just were very amusing, um, that, ya know, some people I knew and, ya know, things we did. Things like that But I really felt like I was putting off a lot of things to go...like to be able to go out and do stuff as much as...like the time that we...we did some really silly things but nothing like, specifically like oh, this is an adventure when we did that, so I don't know. Well, that's not entirely true. Maybe I just have like irrational expectations as to what my life could be like in my twenties and thirties cuz I had way too much fun while still studying and I just figured there was going to be more than that. I don't know. But, um, ya know it's (sighs) (pause)...but like I said we just had sort of, like you said irrational expectations in terms of that I guess. I don't know. (pause) We built a lot of just contraptions and...I mean it still was very studious type of stuff but we built a lot of contraptions and we did a lot of really dumb ass stuff like duct taping one of our friends to the ceiling. This was totally consensual.</p> Um, just other ridiculous things that were just...</p> Yeah.</p> Um, a couple of hours. It...I'm not exactly...I wasn't...I wasn't party to why this was happening. I was only happened after the fact.</p> But yes. That kind of thing. Or just, ya know, stupid stuff. Um, but the...and of course now that I'm trying to think of anything I can't think of anything like outstandingly fabulous off the top of my head but there was just (pause), ya know, stuff. It, it tech schools often have a history of pranks...</p> That kind of thing. So, um, the people in...the people in my dorm decided single handedly that we were going to steal the entire amount of silverware it had but we were doing it like one and two meals at a time and then we delivered them all back on the last day of classes.</p> That kind of stuff.</p> But we did eventually single handedly have all the silverware. That kind of stuff. Um, ya know, stripping down monitors and dropping them to watch them implode. Back of the monitors were actually going to (inaudible at 00:26:16). So you know all that stuff, ya know. But (pause) and I'm not really looking for that really as much as just, ya know (pause)...it is weird to be confronted with the fact that I was considered to be sort of a legend. People I never met in my life knew who I was...</p> ...and sort of like knew me as being, ya know, being cool and like smart and all this other stuff. It was very weird to be a very different person from that and being confronted with the well, there's Debra stories, ya know?</p> Um, well I was voted into office at a university I didn't attend, or a college I didn't attend.</p> Yeah, I got...somehow got in as a student representative at the College of Law, which is separate from the university, the, the Institute of Science. They have all these different schools...</p> Um, because people saw me around there so often. Just stuff. Um (pause) like I said just...things just happened. People just knew I was just this, ya know, usually the instigator of everything that was stupid and bad and in general not something you should be doing. That kind of thing. Not bad like that but like, ya know, um, there would often be things like gravity testing regularly to make sure the gravity was still there. Just you know various things.</p> Oh, there were all kinds of things. Usually things that when filmed would be, ya know, interesting. Like things imploding or things...</p> ...that were, ya know...it's regularly known that they had dropped, ya know, all kinds of stuff cuz it sparks or it does this or it does that. Ya know that kind of stuff. Or I just...I mean it was always something. It was always something weird that we were doing. Something with liquid nitrogen. Something with...that we...you know that we probably shouldn't have done and so it just I...although about 80 percent of the things that are attributed to me being involved in, probably I have nothing really to do with somehow. Or I had something to do with it but I wasn't really the person who decided to do it. Like it just, it just sort of (pause) ya know sort of became sort of a legendary thing for that and so it's weird to be different than that, ya know? Um, so...it's it's...ya know I can't think of anything off the top of my head but usually it was just hilarious things involving ya know. Like I got everybody in my dorm to go on Tuesday nights to one this place in bathrobes. We would always dress up in bathrobes so we could look like escaped mental patients in our head.</p> Cuz you know mental patients really do walk around in bathrobes really.</p> Yeah. Like, and we'd all troop down there together to do this, or you know that kind of stuff. We were just like...and yes maybe I had a lot to do with it but for some reason I was the person who always got attributed as the person for things like that, and so. There was never anything really truly bad...</p> ...just...</p> Yeah. Nothing that anybody ever got hurt with.</p> And I guess I had nothing to do with the duct tape because I'm not really sure exactly what that was about but it was funny.</p> Ya know? Um, that kind of stuff, ya know? And so, and so it's weird not to be like that any more too much, ya know? I don't even know where to start. I mean that was just second nature to me. I'd be like so I wonder what's inside of this thing, ya know, or let's figure this out.</p> Ya know, or I don't know. Something...it used to be so second nature to me to be like that that I really felt like when I was on campus I was becoming who I was and now I'm not so much like that and it's just...I miss it.</p> Someday you have to grow...at some point you had to grow up and be like okay so ya know like. Oh yes. There we go. Um, when something was supposed to be destroyed that was not totally. Something had to be destroyed so it wasn't unrecognizable and it was made...it was a metal chassis of magnesium and like, oh yeah. You didn't specify how it had to be destroyed. Magnesium is a...magnesium is a type of metal that you can light on fire. This actually...</p> Yeah. With a very bright white light that you can't even look at.</p> And like it well it was, it was like why does it have to be destroyed? Okay, well I'm going to take it down and we're gonna light it on fire in the parking lot.</p> Yeah. That kind of stuff.</p> And sure, we were supposed to destroy it. Magnesium also bends really easily so you could have easily just taken a vice to it and...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. But it was based...a lot of the times when you build certain types of things, um, like internal chass...actually, um, your laptop version a couple before that had magnesium on the inside. As light.</p> But I mean, to get it to catch fire you have to be like 1100, 1200 degrees so you actually really have to like...</p> (Chuckles) Arc welding.</p> So yeah, plasma type...</p> ...but yeah. So, ya know, that kind of stuff.</p> Of course.</p> We had a laboratory of stuff, ya know. We're told...I mean this is for a job. They said destroy this and like okay. So, we did. You didn't specify how you needed it to be destroyed, so ya know. Um, and so it's just, um...I mean at some point you had to grow up and stop like lighting things on fire but not that I ever really had a deep need to light things on fire.</p> It just seems like things always happened that way. Or realizing that the commercial dishwasher is good for cleaning everything, um, that was great. There's a thing called a Hobart that's a giant commercial dish...you just put things in here, water comes down. It's what they use for commercial dishwashing.</p> You realize that just about everything that was dirty if you put it in and you put through the Hobart and it came back out it was clean. I was the one that came up with that idea.</p> Like anything that was dirty at all. Like anything plastic or anything that like could be exposed to water. Just put it in there. Cat box.</p> Um, oh gosh, we put all kinds of...like I came up with like a big wheel. You just shoved it in there. You can it and came back out it was clean.</p> That kind of stuff.</p> Ya know? Um, so (pause) and ya know I think I told you the story about the only time I ever got into a bar fight. Not bar fight, but a party fight in which I hit a professional sportsman.</p> Yeah. That's probably part of the reason why I was legendary in that (inaudible whispering at 00:33:45).</p> But, ya know it's just I...I liked being kind of cocky, ya know? I, ya know, had my barrage of snarky I'm-better-than-you-are T-shirts that said like I heart math on them, and I, ya know, had a slide rule that I barely knew how to use but I could use better than just about anybody else so therefore it sounded, ya know, like I was a lot better than I really was, and I was cool and I was smart and, ya know, and we...I don't know. I kind of miss it. I was very arrogant, extremely arrogant and it was kind of...because I had the goods to back it up, (inaudible at 00:34:30) respected me, ya know? (pause) It was kinda nice.</p> (Chuckles) Yeah, if you're living like the...the...if you're living like in the movie ""Real Genius"" maybe but in the real world it doesn't always work that way.</p> Yeah. So, but sometimes I miss it.</p> I don't know that that many people actually have those kind of experiences, though. Some people do but not everybody.</p> But, ya know it's...but I kinda miss that kind of stuff and so I feel really embarr...at the time I'm also wanting to be perpetually young I also feel embarrassed for being immature, which is even weirder I know. I just want to basically be able to pause my body at a certain age and still be older in my head I think. Because I don't want to be immature enough to wish that, ya know, I was still in college or to like, ya know to be so shallow as to think that things are important, so (pause) I just, um...when you don't have a whole lot of other things going on in your life—I mean I have a lot going on but not like it's fulfilling.</p> You sort of fall back on the things that were really great and so it's really hard to be telling stories that, ya know, things that happened back in 1998. I mean it's starting to really stretch this like, ya know, time and period of time, ya know. Or, ya know, a time period of doing things, ya know?</p> Yeah. (pause) I guess so. (pause)</p> Yeah. (pause) It was. Funny thing is, is that, the other thing is that there was a time when back when, ya know—he wasn't my husband back then but my boyfriend was fairly normal, ya know? He was my co-conspirator in most things.</p> Yeah, oh it depends on what it was, but usually I mean he tolerated it, but he was a happier guy, ya know?</p> He was definitely, um, ya know, up for anything, more social, able to ya know handle that kind of stuff, ya know? And so, um, able to deal with things that were not the same as his own way of thinking too, ya know? Um, I think both of us have gotten pretty closed-minded on that kind of stuff in general. Like sometimes I just like oh my God, I just can't handle this. I just don't want to be around people who honestly believe in like the Gia theory of earth being one big organism. Like that kind of is how sophomoric is that. But like for the most part, though, it's (sighs) ya know, it was a good time in our lives, ya know. He used to brag about the fact that his girlfriend, ya know, impressed the guys in the group not only with her ability to calculate but with the ability to drink. Ya know that kind of stuff. I'm like, the group for instance had people that...</p> Oh, no, no, no it's the...basically it's the people that...is that's the joint project group of people that do like research and testing and that kind of stuff.</p> Yeah.</p> They're associated with the Tech. They're the NASA part of the Tech.</p> Yes.</p> Yeah, yeah they're a very heavy drinking group. In fact, everything about Tech that I have been involved with unfortunately has been a whole lot of heavy drinking. It's the number one reason why I didn't go. (inaudible at 00:38:51) bribed but I think I realized that, um, people were having too much fun there, so...</p> Well, I was actually...I actually, um, accepted. I changed at the last minute to go back to Brown. I did early calculus out there, um, so...I just, ya know, after having been out in...after being out West and I realized how amazingly party the atmosphere was and how about half of the people I met weren't actually students. They were there but they were not enrolled. There was like this huge like washout rate of people who were still having a good time and spending all this time on campus but had already failed out or they were on academic probation.</p> It made me feel like maybe this was going to be a little too much of a good time, so...but yeah that group came out every year to do some stuff and, um, ya know, at the time it was doing lots of stuff related to that, so it was pretty cool. Um, ya know just he was proud of that, ya know. And it's not like he's not proud of me now but it was definitely...I was a much cooler...I was a much cooler accessory to people's lives than, ya know...ya know and at the time it still was a little bit (inaudible at 00:40:21) definitely at the time. If you didn't want to go somewhere, I always had a date. Didn't bother me. And he understood that like it wasn't romantic but I never had a problem with finding someone to take me to whatever it is that I wanted to do, and so...</p> Bad ass (whispered). And I miss that.</p> Ya know? (pause) I miss that.</p> And yet some things have changed and some things are exactly the same there, which is, ya know...like there's this one dorm room that...there's this one dorm apparently which...we didn't actually talk to anybody but I could tell it was definitely that way. The card reader never really worked right because of the like where it was placed and so it was easier just to, just do one swift pull and pull the door open to yank it open than it was to actually legitimately use the card reader to get the door.</p> Like that was that like back in like the 90's. It's still like that.</p> Yeah. Ya know, that kind of stuff, and so, um, (inaudible 00:41:37) it was a good time in life, and so...I mean I'm not saying that I have to be like that all the time, but it was, ya know...I think that maybe that was sort of a big letdown for me, was the fact that my life hasn't been as cool as all that. I don't...I wasn't like this in high school by the way. I was never...I mean I had friends and things like but I was never that popular, ya know, and so it was sort of a big shock.</p> And (pause) yeah. It was a good time.</p> And, um, I'm not saying it always has to be that way, ya know? But...</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> No.</p> Yeah. It was a...I think the big thing is it was so unexpected to have me feel so at home there and had become super popular and to have that kind of like...</p> ...legendary status, like not having ever in my life, that it was (pause) it was nice. And that happened a little bit, ya know, in different places I worked too. I mean there's things that...it was a lot more conservative on that level.</p> But it was, ya know...it definitely was, ya know, on some level the people ya know?</p> It was still pretty cool for a long time. Now I'm this babbling idiot that, ya know, sometimes fixes people's phones, so...I think that's part of the reason why I've sort of had to embrace the weird now at my workplace cuz it's about the only thing exciting that ever really happens, ya know?</p> Like, ya know embracing the strange things that occasionally happen at work.</p> And just sort of hold on to those things cuz it's like.</p> There isn't really anything else exciting in my life. I mean I help little old ladies book trips to Vegas, ya know, for the most part. So when you do get the person who like (sighs) does something completely absurd to their phone and they're trying to figure out, trying to figure out if it's possible to be considered under warranty, ya know...</p> ...it's a gem, so.</p> That's good. If you start to have a regular opening on Thursday afternoons I would like that.</p> Um, summer's easier for me in terms of my joints but also just, I just want to try and plan for the future in general.</p> Yeah, I'm sort of keeping that ahead so that when come October if something comes...</p> Plan ahead.</p>",1
1000017869.txt,"You probably, I've been here (chuckles) for two hours. Crazy. </p> I thought you weren't feeling well because my girlfriend said, you know when she called she didn't sound like she was feeling too well. So I said, ""Oh well, she's probably not feeling (inaudible at 0:00:27.4)."" I didn't come in. I called. Everybody got a good laugh though because I said my doctor was sick. (chuckles) You know, because I told them I had to go to the doctor. So you know, they said, oh, ok. And then they said, (inaudible at 0:00:42.8) you're not going to the doctor? I said, ""Oh, my doctor's sick."" And they all cracked up they thought it was so funny. Oh well, that's the way that goes. </p> Yeah, yeah, it was funny because I was used to. I know, what? Like I, I guess every time I come out, I mean I feel lots of times I start thinking about what I had said and everything and some of the hurts that start coming. But at least then it's like saying, well now I'm discovering some of the reasons why I feel, you know like the way I do. </p> But you know, I talked to my Mother Saturday and it was such a rotten experience. Because you know like I went away and I still felt so empty. I talked to her and like, every time I went to talk about one of my problems, I wanted to talk about my Grandfather or something. Do you know she wouldn't even listen more or less. It was like, like she'd listen and then she'd start getting tears in her eyes and so she'd change the subject. It was like she's fighting it as much as I am. Only I don't want to fight it. I want to find out what the hell is going on with me. And she doesn't seem to even care enough, you know like to really get it out, into the open.</p> And I said, you know like, ""Do you remember any things that I did? Like do you remember any time we had a fight or we had something that I was, you know like really moody or really hurt about it?"" She says, ""No."" But just something I kinda bugged me because I did it later on. I thought it started, you know, when I went to the first foster home. But it didn't. It started when I was home. She said, ""When you didn't want to talk to somebody, you wouldn't."" 0:02:22.2</p> So you know like sometimes I just would sort of go into that shell by myself even when I was a little kid. </p> And I don't remember that. And I had, I talked about my father. And I said you know like, ""Did my Father pay a lot of attention to me?"" She said, ""No because he was afraid he would hurt you."" So you know, it was something like what my girlfriend had with her father. You know like he was afraid to play with her. And he would never take her any place because he didn't know what to do with her, you know. Well not so much he didn't know what to do with her, he was afraid of her. And you know I said, ""Jesus."" So, that much I found out. And I kinda figured that. You know like there was no real relationship with my father. And I guess that bothered me. </p> Very. Yeah. It did. It hurt again. You know because it was like when I'm just conjecturing things and I say, ""Well maybe."" But then it's always like, see? I'm kinda funny in real life. Sometimes I'll say, ""Well it could be. But then it could be something else too. It doesn't have to be that way."" You know, and it's like. </p> Yeah, and now I know. There's no way to run from it. There's no way to say maybe it's not. But maybe he really did, but maybe it's you know. You know. That's it. That's it Charlie. You had it. And when you think about, you know I used to think about it and go, ""Oh Jesus."" You know. I felt so depressed. But you know like I started talking about my Grandfather. This really kind of got me mad. Not mad but I felt hurt again because my Mother wouldn't even really listen. She saw me start to cry. And rather than just let me, so what if there's people around? Let them look. I don't care, you know. So they're her friends. She could say, ""Well she had a fight with her boyfriend."" You know, she didn't have to tell anything. We weren't getting real loud or anything. 0:04:02.5</p> And I said, ""Jesus, she's not even listening to me."" It's like, and it's like I know she really wants to help. </p> Yeah, I want it out in the open. </p> I want her to talk about it. She'll start to get tears in her eyes and everything. And then I don't want to push her too much, one thing. And then she just changes the subject. </p> She off and running on something else. And I say something like, ""My brother, I don't think my brother cares about me."" ""Oh don't say that."" You know, that's it. Subject's closed. She completely dismisses me.</p> Yeah. It's like I try to get them out. And now they're starting to come, you know. And like you talk to your own mother and you think that.. Ok, I told my girlfriend even this. I don't have a relationship with my Mother anymore. I told my Mother this. I said, ""Mom, don't you think there's some reason why I couldn't find a way to get out? All this time I couldn't find a way to get out. I could get out of this area. I could have done this all the time."" I said, ""Why don't you think it is? Why do you think it's like I don't even think sometimes to come out here? Or I don't want to come out here for some reason."" And I says, ""I guess part of it is because it's like a rejection and part of it is like, you know like it, I guess it hurts me."" Like when I go out to see her. Because it is like, it like reminds me that I don't have her around. </p> And I told her like that time when I was crying when I was sixteen and I was crying for her. So I'm sixteen years old and I needed my mother and I was crying for her. And I knew you couldn't be there and I knew you wanted to be there but it was still like the idea that I was hurt because you weren't there. </p> And I was telling her this and then she just, it was like, I don't know it is just like she keeps cutting me short, like. </p> She couldn't, I don't know if she couldn't accept it yet or whether she can't accept that there's you know like something's wrong with me, or she blames herself, or what the heck it is. But, you know it's like I can't talk to her. I try. And I try to get her into a serious conversation like, ""Mom, there is something wrong with me. This is one thing. Admit it. It's not your fault. It's not anybody's fault. There's just something wrong with me and I want to get it over with."" 0:06:10.4</p> You know. And it's things like every time I go out there she wants me to get married. I can't get married.</p> I mean Jesus. Can you imagine the kids I'd come out with if I ever did?</p> No. And she won't let me, you know like I want to talk to her about. I said like, ""Do you remember any times when I was with my father?"" You know like, part of it is my father too I think. </p> But like, she says no he was sleeping lots of times. And he didn't hug you and everything because he was afraid he was going to hurt you. And this is what I needed because she's, I said did my Grandfather do that and she said yeah. Not often but he did. And I, it wasn't even, you know it wasn't even all the physical. I wanted the physical. But my Grandfather was so nice to me. He just, you know he had so much love and my Father didn't have it for me at all. (crying) All he cared about was my brother. </p> And my brother became my father to me and I know it. Because he was there to protect me all the time. And now he doesn't care. (crying)</p> And I told my mother that and all she says is, ""Oh, don't say that. Your brother loves you. I'm sure he loves you."" You know like, what the hell good does that do? She thinks he loves me. I know he doesn't love me. (crying)</p> (crying) She won't even admit it, you know. She, I don't know, she's like I am in a way. But at least I try to face reality. 0:08:00.8</p> (crying) I guess I just feel so sad because she won't help me. </p> She didn't help me all my life and now when I come to her and all I'm asking her is to tell me a little bit about anything. Anything she can remember. And all she can remember is ""Oh you were a pretty good little kid. Sometimes you wouldn't talk to people.""</p> That's the only thing she gave me.</p> (crying) You know when you're a little kid you don't always remember. But my Mother was an adult. And if she cared a lot about me she'd remember some of the things I did. Whether they were good or bad, she'd remember them. She remembers like two or three little things that I remember myself. </p> (crying) It's almost like she had no excuse because my Father was sick. He wasn't sick but he was always sleeping. But she was awake all the time and she was with me. And she doesn't remember half the things that we did together or anything. Some of the things I have to remind her that I do remember. And she's supposed to be my Mother. </p> (crying) You know, I know we've been strangers for the last couple of years, if she doesn't, you know if she doesn't know me now ok. But she should have known her own daughter when she was little. </p> (crying)</p> (crying) It doesn't seem like there is anything there, you know. It's like, it's still that strange though it bugs me. It still always with Ed and her (inaudible at 0:10:06.6). That was before I was there. I remember even when I was a little kid asking, ""But Mommy where was I? Why wasn't I there, Mommy?"" It always made me feel like that. Like she was, the only thing she used to tell me about when, you know, when she was younger. Well she told me once she was in an orphanage. Yeah. That was another thing. I can remember one thing that really hurt me. She said, ""Oh I want you to go to Minnieville because that was where I was raised. And it's a real nice place."" You know and all this bull shit that even as a little kid I was afraid and I didn't know why. And I think it's because before that she told me about this nun. That she had broken a dish and the nun beat her up for it. And I guess even as a little kid I was like, wait, why does my mother want to send me some place where they beat her up? </p> I don't know. You know I keep trying to think logically. I keep saying, my Mother couldn't help it. She couldn't help it. But then when, you know. I just don't know why I feel like this. I just feel like I needed her, you know like I couldn't ever go to her. Even when I went to see her I couldn't talk to her. </p> I don't even know why. Even when I was a little kid I couldn't talk to her. </p> I'd go out there and I'd watch TV or some stupid thing and I remember sometimes I used to get spanked because I wouldn't even, I wouldn't talk to her when I was there. </p> I just didn't know what to say to her. (crying)</p> She kept telling me what a bad mother she was. And I kept saying, ""No you're not. No you're not."" And that was about all we ever said to each other. </p> I knew she felt bad because she wasn't there, but you know like....0:12:03.6</p> (crying) She didn't even have to be with me all the time. I could write a letter to her or something but I can't even talk to her. I really can't. I go out there and... I used to talk like a bullet. I just told her anything and everything. And sometimes like when I told her I'd given the Catholic Church up, I think it was just to hurt her. I don't even know why I wanted to hurt her. </p> Because I felt rejected and I wanted to reject her for, I don't know what it was. But I just, I couldn't even talk to her like a, like in a loving term or anything.</p> You know, or like have a discussion with her because like first of all, she's (nothing) in the world. She reads and she sees the news but like she's not out living. I just can't even talk to her. I see my girlfriend and her mother how they talk. And I want the relationship they've got. (crying) My mother and I don't have anything. </p> (crying) It's just like one big hole and that's what I'm in. </p> (crying) That's the way it feels like I need friends or somebody. I think that's why I latch on to friends the way I do. It's like, it's somebody to care. </p> (crying) And you know, I don't think I would have had that need if I would have had her when I did need her. When I was a little kid so I could become secure. </p> And now it's like, I don't know I just feel like, I'm almost afraid. I'm afraid of getting real close. I'm afraid like, I get so paranoid. And hurt right away. Like my teacher, Saturdays he'll take me home. Well, the first thing I thought of was he likes my roommate and I know he does. And it's like, well he'll expect me, the first thing I think of, well he'll expect me to invite him in. And he wants to see her. All he's doing is using me. It's like, you know like, I really get so mad because it's like people don't really care about me. I'm just like a vehicle to get to somebody else. </p> And you know like that hurts so much. Because it's like, it's like saying, like you're nothing. You know like, I don't care that he doesn't like me. I don't like him. You know and I don't care that he doesn't like me. The only thing I do care about is I like people to respect me when I know them. I respect him as a teacher and as a man. And I want him to respect me the same way. You know like, and what did I do to have him feel like, you know like use me as just like something you know to get to somebody else. I think that is a most sick thing. You know like, when I'm the one that is being the object of it, it really bugs me. And it's like they, I don't know. I wouldn't use anybody to get to somebody else. I think that's one of the worse things in the world to do. Because I know how I feel. And I wouldn't want to make somebody else feel like that.0:16:35.0</p> You know, and like I said, I don't care that he doesn't like me. He said I'm good at working out, I said very good. You know and I'm really happy about that. But you know like, why use me, you know? </p> It's like, it's happened before. They'll talk to me because they want to talk to her, things like this. I said, well partly it's because she is so much more advanced and she's got a natural magnetism for people. Maybe I don't have it. I don't know. But I don't really care if everybody doesn't like me. Just like, I don't want to be used to get to somebody else. </p> (crying) You know? I want to be somebody. And I want somebody to care about me just because I'm me. </p> You know, I can take other people and I can like them and they've got lots of faults and things like this and they may not even be all that smart. They might not have a college degree. There's a fellow I like right now who doesn't have any of those things. And he's not even that smart, but it's just that he's good at caring about people. The people he works with. The people, you know like, for girls, for me. It's just like, that's the type of relationship I like. And he likes me. So you know like this is fine. But like in general, I don't feel like I have anybody. And you know just basically like some, some crazy little things. Like he'll walk in when I'm typing, because this is where I go at night. He's not my boss, he's just one of the other guys. He'll come up, he'll mouth the words I love you. You know, to me, I know he doesn't mean it. He's just infatuated. The whole baloney, but. He just makes me feel so good. Because somebody said I love you, you know? </p> It's like, it's serious. It's all the, you know I'm in love with her. Infatuated. It's like, oh man, I'm madly in love with this woman and she's perfect. All this baloney. But you know. </p> You know. It's just like, it is something. It makes you feel like wow, you know. You know it's not true. You know it's not real. But it is. It's like saying, you know you're somebody special. And it just makes you feel so good. And so many other people are so, I don't know. They just take you for anything they can get you for. </p> Like my boss is back now. I'm working for him. I don't know. He hasn't touched me anymore. I told him you know. I just gave him the hint. Just leave me alone. But I don't know how long that's going to last either. You know, and what really hurts me about him, it wasn't so much because, I needed that attention. I really needed it. I needed somebody to come and put his arm around me and say, you know, say nice things to me and things like this. I needed that attention then. When I got it from him, I didn't care who I got it from really. </p> But, now I don't know what to do. Because I don't feel like I need it from him anymore. </p> My other boss, which is crazy. He was another one that started things like, you know like, in front of people he started to grab a hold of me and things that I could say, you know like, stop it already. You know I don't like going out afterwards or you know like kissing and all this baloney. This is fine because we also kind of date in a round about way. </p> But, I said that's fine. As long as it's not in front of other people because that makes me feel cheap again. </p> And like, I'm not a cheap girl. And I don't run around with everybody. And it just burns me that people get this idea, part of it I think it is because I just you know, like I don't know what it is about me that sometimes people get that idea. </p> Always get that idea. Now some of my skirts because I got heavier got too short. And I know that much. But it's not like, like at one time I did do that. I know I did. But it was just for attention. It wasn't for you know, I didn't want to go to bed with anybody. I just wanted a fellow to notice me. And I would do anything I had to to make him notice me. </p> But like now I don't feel like I do that. There's lots of fellows who do think you know, I'm classy and things like this. He even thinks I'm classy. But he's just like, I don't know whether it's an ego thing with him and I'm another object or what it is. You know but it's like, like none of the other fellows would think of doing that, you know. None of the other, I was working with these other fellows. And none of them ever laid a hand on me. They never said a word out of the way. They were perfect gentlemen. They all said they were real sad to see me go because they really liked me and I really liked them. And you know, I think I'd worked for them two weeks and they give you this gorgeous present for Christmas and everything. And you have to go back to this other ass. I can't stand that guy any more. </p> I think it's because probably what I did, probably what he did to me. </p> He made me feel cheap. Things like I'd say, ""Please don't put your hands on my arms or anything when people are around. People are talking. I'm losing my reputation."" He'd say, ""Oh, well that doesn't bother me, boy."" You know, it's like. I'd said all that and he said something like, ""Don't worry about your reputation. That makes me feel good."" All this because he's an older man. It's a big thing with him to have a young girl around. </p> I don't want, yeah. I don't even care. You know like I would rather have a fellow as a friend, and have him respect me. No matter how sexy, no matter how attracted, some fellows I am attracted to sexually. Every girl is. But I would rather have him for a friend. And have him around for a long time and have him respect me than have some, some guy come up and pay lots of attention nicely. And then all of a sudden it's like hands all over you and all this bullshit. </p> Yeah. It's like, it's like, what they're doing, it's not me that they're after, you know. </p> They see a girl and maybe a couple of the other fellows say she's classy looking. Or she dressy sharply. Or she's this or she's that. So right away, if I can put my hands all over her and if I can do it in like (inaudible at 0:22:41.4) can pick up because my girlfriend says it's to be very careful. Because when I first started working for him I was looking for somebody or something so badly and I didn't understand it at all. </p> It was like I was. I was just, it wasn't even crying. It was like I needed somebody so badly it was like I was half dead, you know. Somebody's got to love me. </p> And I didn't realize what I was saying, you know. It was like, when he started paying attention to me, boy it was great. I used to think he was sexy. When I first started therapy, oh gee, you know I thought he was so...</p> And then I realized all it was like you know he was an older man. And he was paying the kind of attention at first like I wanted my father to pay to me. </p> Any kind of attention from a man because I was looking for my Father.</p> You know and I couldn't get anybody to give me, or my Grandfather probably more. </p> And I don't want him. I still have that hurt but I know what it is. It's so I'm not grasping for something. And like since I haven't, I've gotten this, you know this younger other boss. And he kind of likes me. He's still playing around on a wife and that so he's not really madly in love with me, but. You know we've got like a real honest relationship.</p> He says he thinks I'm sexy and he likes me. And he likes to be with me.</p> And he likes to kiss me. And things like this. And he said eventually he'd like to go to bed with me. He came out very honestly and said that. And it was like, it was like saying, I'm not going to use you. Because see, if he would have said I love you and all this other baloney and I'm going to divorce my wife and I'm going to marry you and let's go to bed and all of this, I would have said you know like, oh here we go again. </p> But Seth was very honest with me. He just said you know like, ""I like you. I like to be with you."" Which is actually a lot more to me than somebody saying you know like, ""Oh wow. Gee. I'm madly in love with you."" All this other baloney. And then not have it last, you know like two weeks from now he won't even know you, you know. </p> It's like with Seth is very, very honest about it. He just says, you know like, ""I'm sexually attracted to you."" I say, ""Ok. You know, this is how you feel. Ok.""</p> And like every time, I've always come out, like you know we'll start kissing or something and he'll start getting, now he starts to start petting. And I say you know stop. And I told him this, well I did make up one story. But I had to with Seth. Seth's got a wife. And Seth loves his wife. And if I let myself go and say I didn't have anybody. And nobody, you know like, I really didn't have anybody right now and I didn't care about anybody and nobody cared about me. </p> Then what I'd be saying to you is I'd be letting him, letting myself open for him to come and you know just walk all over me. </p> Because you know like if you don't have anybody a fellow's going to say, ""Well, she's got nobody anyway. This is better than nothing."" You know? And then this way, like I tell him I've got a boyfriend in Connecticut. You know like and I see him every once in a while when he comes in. So it's like saying like, ""I really care for somebody else too. So you don't have to lie."" See? This is what I'm saying. It's like you don't have to lie to me. You don't have to say you love me and all this baloney for me to go out with you. Or even to kiss you or whatever. If it goes any further to go any further, you know. It's like, and I kind of feel good about it because now I can... I mean it hurts a little bit. To have somebody say like, well but he doesn't really say that because he also says he likes my mind by saying he likes to be with me. You know but like, I don't like somebody just to take me as a shell, this or that. You know like, I like you spiritually. I like you physically. I like you mentally or whatever. I want to be liked as me. The whole thing me, you know.0:26:37.1</p> And like he's saying in so many words that he does like me that way. I mean like he likes having me around. And it's nice. It's a nice feeling for me to have somebody say that even though they don't love me. Just to say, ""You know, it's nice having you around."" And I don't know. But then like Will makes me feel good too because he gives me the other that I need. The romantic bullshit. And I know that's all it is. </p> You know like, he's just a nice guy. He's very loyal. It's like, somebody tried to attack me up in the bathroom. So like when I go up now, I go to tell him. I say you know like, ""I'll be back in five minutes. If I'm not back, somebody come and check."" He's like, ""Oh, no, no, no."" Takes me up in the elevator, you know. Like Seth took me up yesterday and waited for me until I was finished and then took me down again. And, but it's like, you know this is like little things, like people show me finally. People are starting to show me that they care. And it's like, I need part of this, because like I'm giving a little more. But it's still, it's still I'm actually afraid. I don't know. Like Jodie says to me, ""Why don't you have people over to the house?"" I said, "" Because I don't know anybody well enough. I'm afraid to ask them.""</p> You know. And it's like I'm so afraid to ask them partly because I'm afraid they're going to say no. And it's just like, and I know this. I say, ""Oh it's because I don't know them well enough and you know like who knows what they are. What kind of people they are until you get to know them."" And all this bullshit. But it just, I think it just comes right down to the fact that I'm afraid somebody's going to say no. I'm going to say you know, here I am, open like a book, be my friend or if you want to be my friend. And somebody's going to turn around and say no and walk away. 0:28:13.5</p> And it's just going to like shatter me. </p> Because like, see it's happened so often with people who shouldn't be that way. </p> They're just going to walk, they're just going either walk away or they're going to use you and then walk away. I have been so afraid of that. I don't know why. I don't know. I think I felt like I was a little bit used at Foley's.</p> Because all I did was, all I can remember doing is working and babysitting. </p> You know like I was nine years old when I came there. </p> And I just, I just figured because when I was home, I figured it was going to be like when I was home. When I was home I just ran and I played and I did whatever I wanted to do. I hardly did any work at all. In fact I don't think I did any. </p> And I was like, I was spoiled. And I know it. I was a spoiled brat. At eight years old you can at least be able to make your own bed and do dishes. There's no reason why you can't. </p> But I was spoiled and my Mother wasn't up to teaching me things. And then like I think I figured I'd go back to my home type life. And you know, it just wasn't like that. And it was like another shattering. Wait a minute you know. This isn't the way I thought it would be. </p> And it's just like, I guess maybe that is the way it has been all the time and it's like I'm afraid this is going to happen again. You know like, ""Ok, I'm in the real world folks. Ok, Hi, I'm here."" I'm not going to lie to myself. I'm not going to say that you know like things are the way I want them to be when I know they're not. </p> Like I can see myself doing it again. I can just see it. Like we all went off. This is what happened. I was working the other day. And you know, the first day I was back with my boss. So this other fellow who works with us, he's real nice. He's a real sweet guy. And he's a pretty good friend to me. He said, ""Don't forget to say good night to us before you leave."" So I did. And when I did, they said, he said, well they both said, ""Are you hungry?"" And I said yeah I was hungry. So we went out to eat. But I ended up, my boss wanted to take me and I wouldn't.</p> You know like, the first time when we had to take one car to pick up the other car and I said, ""Oh I don't want to get out because it's muddy."" You know so I stayed with Rori. And then we went out and ate. And I don't know, like when I went to go home, like Rori said, ""Oh you don't trust me as much as him."" and things like this. And he kept saying to me, ""You know he really is a nice guy."" And I'm thinking that, see right away I'm defending him. I say, ""Oh yeah well, he did say Rori why don't you take her home."" Because he knew I didn't want to go home with him. He knew like I don't want to start anything up after I haven't worked with him. I just don't want to start anything. We can be friendly. We can go out for a drink or have a sandwich as long as there is somebody else there. </p> Or a group of people. But I don't want to start anything. And you know like, I want him to know that. But like it's, like it's almost like saying, ""Oh now Jane, you were wrong."" And the first thing it's like, it's like I don't want it to be real. I don't want it to be the way I know it is. I know he's using me. </p> I know if I let him he'd walk all over me and leave me there and maybe come back and stomp again on me. Because he's just that type. If somebody gets in his way, poom. </p> And it's like, like when Rori says, ""Most people don't like him but I understand him and I know he's a nice guy."" But then, you know the first thing I said, ""Oh yeah, gee, he really is."" And then I thought to myself, ""Bull. Remember the last time you were talking to Rori and he didn't like it."" Because again, you know it was like his toy was talking to somebody else. </p> And he said, what did he say? Oh, Rori left. He said, ""Rori. Ugh, you could do better than that I hope."" You know so it's like, Rori is a nice, big, puppy dog type guy. He's just a sweet nice guy. 0:31:59.7</p> And he's, you know he just, he doesn't have any kind of polish. But things like, he broke his foot and I got him coffee. And he came out and he said. You know he made me feel so good. Because he said, ""No wonder everybody likes you because you always do such nice things for people."" And I said, ""Why? You mean there really are some people around here who don't talk about my dresses and don't talk about tits."" Oh, like the old ladies. Oh Christ. But you know he could just make you feel so good by saying nice things like that. </p> You know like, and it wasn't like, ""Boy you're so sharp. Boy you're this. Boy you're that."" It was just a nice honest thing like saying, ""I can see down. And there's something good there that I can see."" </p> You know like lots of other people can't see it. </p> Yeah and like I care about other people. And it's like, you know I wasn't doing it because I wanted to, I can't even say I even wanted to wait on him or anything. It's just like, it's very easy for me to feel for other people. And feel what other people's positions and places. Like I could see myself. I wouldn't want to be running around with a cast when I first got it on and be going to get coffee and coming back and things like this. And you know like, I got him a pack of cigarettes one day and left them on his desk to make sure he had those too. </p> Because like walking all the way to the elevator and going downstairs and then getting those, you know going down the escalator, and then getting the cigarettes, coming back up. That's a big job for somebody that's got a cast on. </p> And it's just like you know it's not, it's just like it's very easy for like, you know for me. I have no problem with that. Feeling for other people. But it's like I know what I want to do for other people but like I'm just afraid to do it a lots of times. </p> It's so funny because I'm not afraid in the office. I always use the excuse like, ""Well, you're supposed to do this. Because then you get raises."" And all this bullshit which isn't true. It's like, I want to do it. That's why I do it. </p> Thing like emptying their ashtrays. Like this one boss used to always have his, the one when I was working for them, use to always...</p> Yeah. And it's just like. </p> And be happy. And it's just like, if you can do something that's so easy and makes people happy. I mean they don't have to come to you all the time and say, ""Oh thank you so much"" and all this baloney. But like, like Mr. Keener. He was so cute when I went to leave. He's a great big fellow like a football player. And this other, this wasn't the great big bosses, these fellows are the smaller partners. You know like they've got little hang ups here. One has a lisp. You know you can kind of tell like why they just didn't make it in some different ways. Some of them aren't assertive enough. You know it just, like, you can tell. They're like the smallest partners in the firm and I was working for them. But the biggest gentlemen. You know? You know to me they were the biggest men. Oh I mean they were like babies and things like this but like, they were just so nice to me. 0:34:54.6</p> And things like, when this other guy would say something, ""You're not supposed to Xerox these minutes."" Or something, he was giving me this great big rough time. And I didn't know. I don't go to their partner's meetings. He said, ""It was decided at a meeting."" I said, ""I wasn't at the meeting sir. Sorry."" I said, ""Sorry, I didn't know.""</p> So he's giving me this rough time and my big boss just walked up. And he took a cigar out of his mouth, put his shoulder in front of me and said, ""Look Whit, she did a very good job while she was here."" </p> And all he did was take one look at that mountain and say, ""Oh, ok"" And walked away. But I mean it was just like, it was like he came when I. It's so funny because it sounds so melodramatic. But it was like he came when I needed him, you know? And part of it I know was because, like he was the one that smokes the pipes or the cigars. And like I know like I took special attention to make sure that ashtray was clean. The desk was clean around it and that type of thing. And like, now he was coming back and he was protecting me. </p> Like, you know like, like a man really should do for a woman first of all. I don't think any man should come up and yell at a girl like that guy did, but. </p> Yeah. It's like I don't want to give and take. </p> You know it's like, it's I don't have a real relationship with my other girlfriend. I call her my girlfriend but like ok, like she said she cared about me and everything when we had that party and you know like I got weird and started crying and all this baloney. But it was just like, what does she ever do? I came right to myself and said, all right my girlfriend said that she had invited my other girlfriend over for dinner last night.</p> And she said, ""I told you twice. I told you yesterday and this morning."" And I said to myself, ""Baloney. You were sleeping yesterday when I came in. I don't remember you saying anything this morning."" Which was possible because I got to bed like three o'clock in the morning and I was half asleep, you know. </p> And it's like I said, ""Well if you said something, I didn't hear you."" So she's playing all these little games like when I said something she wouldn't remember. You know, like last night, you know when I came home we started talking. Like this morning, ""Oh you left this money here for the bills."" I told her last night. I said, ""Here's the money. I'm putting it here on your dresser."" You know and it seems like she's trying to play this little game. I know what she's doing. It's like saying it's very bad that you don't listen. Like first of all, I can remember her very vaguely something in the back of my mind, something about Eliza coming over for dinner Tuesday night, which was like, told me like Saturday or Sunday. </p> I work on Tuesday nights. And then I went out to have a hamburger because I was feeling kind of low. Because Seth and I were kissing a little bit and he wanted me to go to his house because his wife isn't there. And like, all right, I wouldn't mind going to bed with him. He's a very sexy guy and I need an affair. I've haven't been in bed with a guy in like a year. And I think I'm just about ready for, you know like a little more adult affair. Like that time was just like I was experimenting. I didn't know what I was doing. I was even more mixed up than I am now. </p> You know, but like, I said, ""Seth, you're going to bring me to your house this late at night? And you're married with the neighbors all around?"" </p> I mean, you know like, I said, to myself, ""Boy, this guy must be awfully..."" You know like, I can see, it's more than just for his wife. It's like saying, this guy is very honest in certain ways, but like, what would he do to his wife? Would he jeopardize? And he loves her. He's crazy. </p> You know like, why would you bring a girl home this late at night? All right he says, ""Nothing will happen if you don't want it to. We can have champagne."" So it was real nice, you know. </p> But to his house?</p> You know to the suburbs with all these people. You know, let's face it. In the suburbs everybody knows everybody else's business. </p> Could he really care about anybody? You know, he's supposed to love his wife. He doesn't care about anybody but him. </p> He wants the pleasure for the moment. He doesn't care. Unless he wants to hurt his wife. Maybe he was mad and he wanted to hurt her or something. I said that, he says, ""I hate to get into these things. But that's all right."" You know like, I guess maybe, maybe he just didn't even think. I don't know. </p> But for some reasons he's lying to himself I think. You know because like, he admits he doesn't really like me. And I mean, if you really loved a girl, you didn't care if your wife turned around and walked out the next day. Ok, so do something like that. </p> You know but, like how can you do that and then turn around and say you love somebody. You know it's like, it's almost like saying, can he really love? Like he's only been married two years. It's kinda, you know, short marriage and divorce situation. </p> You just don't do that. Yeah. It's like, it's like he's got counterfeit with himself. Like another girlfriend of mine does some work for him too and she said, ""You know who he reminds me of?"" I said, ""Who?"" Like he's trying to imitate. You know like I do some imitating too. But she says he looks like Mannix from TV when he's walking and some of the things he does. So I tried that on him. I wanted to pull it on him and see what he'd say. You know I said, ""You know who you remind me of? You remind me of Mannix sometimes."" So, this is the other thing. He lies. And you can tell. Because like I said this in the beginning of the night. And it was almost like he didn't hear me. And then like, at the end of the night he comes out. Like you know like, I'd been working for him. Like I'd been typing an envelope. I'd forgot I'd said it. It just completely. 0:40:33.7</p> Like this was three hours later. He said, ""Why do you say I remind you of Mannix?"" I said, ""No."" He said, ""Ah hah."" I said, ""Well you know who he is don't you? "" He says no. Well first of all, a name like Mannix isn't all that easy to remember if you just like hear it said once and sort of just like slurred over more or less and then you like change the subject right away. Because he started like talking when he came up to me about something else. Unless you really do see this guy a lot or whatever. He said, ""I never saw him. I don't know who he is. I never saw."" You like it's like, and again he's like lying. And he's trying to pull it on me. And I'm not that dumb anymore. I pick on things like this. </p> And so this is why I don't know where in the heck I am with this guy. I know he doesn't care about me. I said, ""Ok, fine."" I mean as far as a girlfriend really goes. Like he doesn't really want a long term relationship with me. Well maybe he does. Because he said, ""So the big boss has been doing this for eight years. Having a secretary and they go out afterwards."" And things like this. And he was married. </p> Yeah. </p> Maybe that's it. That's very true. I think maybe, you know it's like, my girlfriend doesn't like a fellow who dotes on her. And like lots of times I take on her values. But I do like a fellow who likes, I mean like, I may not if I ever get married, I may not marry a fellow who's like that. You know who's constantly doting on me. But like, I think it's kind of fun. You know you have a fellow come up to you, like she doesn't like this bit where fellows come up and say I love you and all this. But things like Will does are so cute. Like he comes up, he won't say it out loud because somebody else is there. He always says like, ""We don't want, you know, make sure that nobody's around."" He doesn't want. What he's doing, what he's saying in essence is like, I don't want them to talk. But not just about me. I don't want them to talk about you. Because I, you know like I, I care about you more or less. </p> You know it's like, which is very nice. Like this other guy, he doesn't care. He puts his hands on me in an office. Like there's six men sitting around and he's going to put his hands on me. </p> You know like, what is that saying. It's like saying, ""Well, this is my little number on the side folks."" You know. And like what does that make me feel like? </p> Like again, it's like, I don't know, like a toy. Like a thing. And Will just makes me feel like such a queen. Because it's like he keeps saying, ""I shouldn't be such a nice guy."" Because you know like, and then he goes something like, I think he even says, ""I want to marry you."" I always laugh and go, ""Oh Will. Come on. Go away."" Like he'd say, ""I'm not going to be a nice guy anymore. Nice guys always finish last."" And I keep trying to tell him that, ""Will don't feel that way. Because I feel a lot more for you than I do for Seth or anybody else in the office."" You know. </p> Like they come out with all these lies and all this other. He's just like a puppy dog coming up and say, lick, lick, yelp, I love you. (chuckles) It's just so cute, you just want to take him and do like this to him. </p> Yeah. It's like, but it's like he is almost like that. I think you can, you can see where like this fellow could get very hurt. And like he can feel. Because he was telling me about this girl. And this was one thing that really got me to, first it got me jealous. Which naturally because it was just like saying he still likes her. Because you could see when he had tears in his eyes when he talked about her that there was something there. But it was like saying like, this fellow can talk about somebody and like he can feel when he's talking. 0:44:08.7</p> And it's a beautiful. All right. People say this baloney that ok, you have to get very intellectual. I say ok. You know like, my mind has been pushed down for a while. I've got to get that. But I don't want to ever get to the point where I don't have emotions. </p> Like I can't feel for somebody else. Because like what is that? That's like a stone. </p> Like I don't want to be a stone. </p> Yeah. And I want to have feelings. And be warm like he is. And he's talking about this girl and I'm like. I don't know maybe he thought I was kind of wild too. Because one time he said, ""Why do you think that every guy who's nice to you wants to get your body or get into your pants."" He's kinda crude. But he says it. Phoom, like that. He doesn't pussyfoot around. He doesn't come out with all these nice little niceys. You know he comes out and says it. </p> He says you know. And he's not, he's not all that quick with the brain. But like he sees things. He perceives a lot of things like other people don't see in people and in things. </p> But like he was telling me like he liked this girls. He didn't say he liked her. He just talked about her. You know it was much as saying he liked her. Because he started to, you know like tears in the eyes and the whole baloney. I shouldn't say baloney, that's not the most real thing around. </p> But like he just talked about her like, you know like how she was, she used to run around with lots of fellows and she was a strip teaser, the whole baloney. But like she married a truck driver. He said it's so beautiful to see them. Because like she really loves him and he really loves her. And that's like, see this is what he's like looking for too. He's looking for a girl who's like her. Maybe. Maybe not just her but somebody who could love him and he could love her. Like nobody could come between them. Nobody. Because it was a real true thing. </p> You know like, she said he loves me for me. You know he never touched her, he never. You know, this was part of the thing with her. Like all the fellows all they wanted to do was to go to bed with her. And that was it and then she'd get trapped. You know. </p> And like she had something that was, you know this fellow really cared about her as a person. </p> And I think this is very beautiful and if a person could you know like experience it, fine. You know like a lifetime of this. This is fine if you can do it. But, it's just so beautiful to meet somebody like Will because he can feel things like this. </p> I mean like. When you see him, like when he's talking about this, I don't know. He's just so. He's got so much love down there, you know. </p> Like he shouldn't be in the business he's in because he's going to get killed. But you know it's just like he's just...</p> Yeah. My mother instinct comes out towards a guy like that. But it is a feeling there. And it's like, I just keep trying to tell him that you know, ""Will, don't keep saying you don't want to be like what you are."" You know like I really like him the way he is. I don't think I could ever get seriously involved in it like he would maybe eventually want. Or maybe he thinks he wants. Or you know like this, you know, this bit you know, like marriage type thing. It couldn't be like that. But I mean like to have a fellow like that as a friend, somebody who is so sensitive. And you know to see him quite often and just talk to him. It's such a beautiful experience because you like, you can feel with him.</p> And he can feel with you. </p> And besides he's very honest with you. He'll come right out and say you know, this, this and this, boom. You know, oh, ok. (chuckles) </p> And yet like my other friend Jim. Like I feel so sorry for him because like he said he was in Viet Nam. And he, he told me, you know like I could feel, like I know he's, he's doing what I did and I'm trying to break through. I told him I was going to therapy. And the first thing he did was, ""Oh you're going to see a shrink."" And you know like, he says he's so liberal minded. But he's really not. He's still, you know like, I told myself, ""Oh my God. He's not going to like me. Why did I do that? I'm so stupid."" You know, and like, and then I realized Jim's been my friend for eight or nine years. If something like this was going to mess our friendship up then there wasn't anything to base it on anyway. It was just like, I guess we just knew each other so we went out, you know. 0:48:13.9</p> So then I tried to tell him you know like, he's been even harder now since he's been back from Viet Nam. It's like he's got this big shell around him. </p> And I tried to explain to him one of the reasons he didn't have friends was because he never gave. He never. He'd pick me up and say, well ok. First he says we'll go to a movie. I says ok so I get dressed like I would to the movies. I want to go to the movies. And then he says like, ""Well, maybe we'll just go eat. Maybe we can go here."" I said, ""Where."" ""I don't know. You pick a place."" I said, ""Ok, Can I really?"" ""Yeah., any place."" I said, ""Good, I'd like to go Japanese."" ""No Oriental."" ""Well I know a good Italian."" ""I don't like Italian food."" It's like saying like if you don't like this, for God's sake, tell me. Find a place you'd like to go to, pick me up and bring me there.</p> And it's like. I don't, I get a little bit irritated. So like if I was just a girl that didn't know him and this was like my first date, I'd tell him to fly a kite. </p> And so I told him this finally. But it's like a breakthrough for me because like I could never tell him before. I could see things. I could see him intimidating me with college. He really intimidated me a lot. </p> I mean I already had the inferiority complex to begin with and he just fed it. You know it's like, ""Oh Jesus, I'm so stupid.""</p> But I was afraid. </p> Yeah. But see I was afraid because, I can't really explain it. Maybe I was afraid I would lose him. Like when I brought him home. Maybe I was afraid he wouldn't like me anymore, you know. </p> And maybe, maybe it was just because I was afraid partly not only that but I was afraid I would lose him you know like one way or another. I'd either lose him to lots of other friends because now he overcomes. He overcomes it when he's secure like in his surroundings. He's funny. He's funny as heck.0:49:58.8</p> I think, well part of it with me too was another inferiority complex. I'd say to myself, well he knows a lot more than I do. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. But see, like he can work at one level. He can work in the intellectual level a lot better than I can.</p> But in the feeling level, like his background too. His father used to beat him all the time. All you hear was his mother and father fighting. You know like he never, he never learned to feel towards anybody, you know? </p> And it's like, I guess just for survival he was all for himself. </p> You know like I was too for a while. And it's like, but now he's got to learn. Because he says things, he says like, ""I don't have time."" </p> And I say, ""Oh come on Jim. Every time I'm with you you keep saying all the girls that call for your little brother Ed."" I said, ""It's because Ed gives."" Any police around? Ed, his brother made some, some, like a real light potion of marijuana, you know. And I never tried it. So I tried it with them. But you know like, it was like, he made one. And he said, this is what he, when Jim come out he says, ""Oh Ed said he made this one especially for you and he made it real light. Because he knew you were just starting and he didn't want anything to happen."" You know, and that's when I say, I said, ""Jim, look at this. This is the way Ed is."" And I'm not talking about, you know, giving drugs to people you know like he's a pusher or anything. He's not. They sometimes make you know like a real light portion for themselves. </p> But it's just like the way he did it. It's like he wanted to make sure. ""I want to make sure now because I understand. And I don't want anything to happen to you."" And it's like, I said, ""Ed cares. That's all it is. He cares about other people and you don't.""</p> Yeah. Because I know about love a little more than he does. And lots more about sharing than he does.0:52:01.9</p> You know and it's like, and it's like I don't want him to feel that way. And then like he said he was back from Viet Nam. He said, you know I know it bothers him. But he says it didn't. He says like, ""You know I used to see dead bodies and laugh."" He says, ""As long as they weren't Americans because we would identify with Americans."" He says, ""Because they were funny. Just in the way the position they were in or whatever."" It was, he said they were funny and then he stopped talking. And like I knew. I said, ""Jim don't you realize what you did? It was like so you wouldn't go crazy. You know you put like a wall around you."" </p> I said, well at first I though it was just hysteria, you know. Because like that's what I would do if I saw somebody, I might laugh because I was hysterical. But he said no. And then I said, ""Well then what you were doing is building a wall around you. Like I did. And I know I did."" And I said, ""But you've got to break through that wall. Because if you don't, oh God."" You know like he's never happy. All he does is, you know like when we go out or something all he does is he's either cutting something down or he's, you know like and I can see how unhappy that guy is. </p> You know like now, now I don't know where I'm going. And now, like I feel lots of hurt. So I know there's more hurts that I've got to, you know that are going to come out. But like at least now, like I get to talking and I can cry. I don't think Jim even knows what the word means.</p> He just like, like he doesn't really even laugh when he laughs. He's like. I can't really explain it. It's just so sad.</p> (crying) Because he's so young. He's really got. Like he tried to help me. He was, he may not have gone around it right. But like Jim could share with me. </p> I don't know why, you know. But like he was very considerate and lots of times he was for himself. But you know like one, in one way he tried helping me. And like lots of other people didn't care. Like my foster parents said, ""Oh college. That's so stupid for a girl."" All of this bull. You know but like he was trying to help me. He could see that my mind needed developing. He could see it was a good mind. 0:54:03.0</p> And like at least he was saying, you know like, ""I'm your friend and I want to help you."" But like, it's all like, now I want to help him but I don't know what the hell to do. </p> You know I said, I came out, you know it just kind of fell out because I had been thinking about doing it. I shouldn't have done it that way. I said, ""Yes I'm taking therapy."" After he said that I said, ""Yeah, and it might be a good idea for you to try to get into the same type of program where you're going."" And this other girl that we know who's a nurse. And like she lives in a little fairy tale world. I'm a little mother and you, like it's unbelievable. She's not even in this world. It's terrible. </p> And like, you know, I just have, I mentioned, I said, ""Oh shit, I shouldn't have done it that way."" You know it's like he did it the wrong with me and now I'm doing it the wrong way with him. And we want to help each other and don't know how the hell to do it. </p> But you know I really, he really intimidated me for a while. And I admit it. But like I am the type of person that that's what I needed. Especially then because like I didn't know where I was going. I was like here. I was there. And you know, it was a terrible feeling just to say like, you know like, almost like I was nothing. You know like I didn't care. I didn't care if I lived or died from day to day. </p> And you know like, like he says like I'm going through college and I'm going through all this baloney. Like lots of the courses are irrelevant. And I'm working all the time. I don't have times for friends. Which is a bunch of baloney right there.</p> And then he says, he says, ""Now I'm going to have to do what Uncle Sam expects you to do in order to get into, to do anything."" Like to be able to get a job or anything. </p> And I said to myself like, ""It almost seems like you don't enjoy anything you're doing.""</p> You know like, I've even learned to enjoy secretarial work a little. Not because of the work itself but things like the client contact and making sure this is done and making sure it's near, whatever it is. </p> You know it's just like, it's like a little bit of a pride in what I'm doing. Even though I really don't care for it. </p> But it's like he hates every minute of the day. And like when we go out even. You know he says, ""The only time I really have fun is when I go out."" I said, ""Jesus, half the night we're out, you're complaining, you know. Or you get into what you call intellectual discussion."" He's not that much of an intellectual. I found that out now. I never realized, you know because it was always because he was ahead of me. He's a level higher than I am. Maybe two. </p> But like, he thinks he's like way above. Like he was talking to this friend of my girlfriend's who is like really, God is that guy smart.</p> And I mean he's smart and you can tell. And he knows everything. You ask about a subject he doesn't know and probably he'll read a whole entire book on it by next week and come back and you know, and he'll be able to discuss it with you. And it's like, but, you know like I just can't get through to my friend. And I want to. But like with this other friend. Like you know I was saying before. Like she said she told me and all this. And then like she's almost like mad at me because like I wasn't home. And I don't remember her ever saying anything. I don't know whether she forgot and thought she said something. Or like maybe if something was said two or three days before and I made a mental note like, ""Yeah, I have to get home early."" Now part of it's like, I didn't want to be there. </p> I didn't want to be there until later on and maybe just to see her, have a couple of drinks with her and then when she went home. Because they have a trip to plan. And I know, I admit I feel left out because I'm not going. And I'd love to. I realize the educational value. You know like seeing, meeting all different kinds of people all over the world. And what, the growth you could you know, go through. Plus the fun you could have, you know. </p> All right so I'm not going and I feel a little bit bad about it. But it doesn't bother me when I'm not around them. When I'm around them and all they do is talk about it it bugs me yeah. I like to be with one or the other. I don't like to be with both of them together because that's all they talk about is their trip. And I think this is fine when the two of them are there. You know and I was trying to explain it to them and they said, ""Well then you should change the subject."" But then if that's the only time they see each other it's not fair for you to change the subject either, you know?</p> It's not fair. It just isn't fair. So I say to myself, I guess maybe, maybe, maybe she did tell me like two or three days ago. I know she didn't tell me when she said she did. But she could have told me two or three days ago. And I just didn't want to be there. 0:58:08.0</p> I really didn't want to be there. So I told her I'd invite her out to lunch or something one day. Meet her for meditation on Sundays at her guru. And then, but it's just like I can't get close to her. And you know like, and I said to myself like, look. She says friendship. She's always yelling at me because she says I don't give enough, you know. </p> She says, ""You give so far but for friends you've got to give more."" I say to myself, ""What has Eliza ever done for me?"" In terms of a friend? She hasn't. </p> Really. Seriously, she has not done anything for me. And it's like, I say, I don't mind being friends with somebody and feeling a friendship and doing things but like why should it be always me doing it and not her? </p> You know like Jodie and I give back and forth. </p> You know like sometimes I give a little more, sometimes she gives a little more. </p> Yeah. Because it was always like I was afraid they didn't like me. </p> Yeah. Probably that's coming out I think.</p> I think it is coming out now a little bit more. It's like, like I'm just beginning a little bit to get some kind of a, of something that at least I'm a person. You know like, like for a long time it was like, I was just like a like, I can't really explain it. It was like a vegetable that was just trying to take in here and take in there and try to find something to be or to do. 1:00:12.7</p> I just didn't know anything. And it's like now I can say a little bit. It's like, you know I've got a long way to go but I can say like a little bit with Jodie like I can say like. Everything she says, I don't just say, ""Yes, Jodie."" </p> That's true. Yeah. And it's partly like if she does say something to me, sometimes I can say, ""You're full of baloney."" </p> Maybe I don't come out and say that. But like in my mind I can say like, ""You're not always right. That's not true."" Because I do know maybe. I do know that it's not true. Or it doesn't make sense to me. And you know like unless you can make sense to me, forget it. </p> And it was like, you know like, it is a little bit better of a feeling. But like, oh God, it's still like. I still have that rejection feeling. And I still have you know like the feeling like. And I know the closer it gets to that trip and breaking up housekeeping and that, the more I feel. You know like it's like, they're leaving and it's like saying again, it's like a rejection. And it's going to take like a long time.</p> To get, to feel like it's not a rejection. I can't have the same friends around me all the time. </p> Yeah because well see, first of all like I said, I told her one day. I said, ""I wish I had some friends."" Because it's like, it's going to be the same thing all over again. To find a friend like Jodie is going to, you know like take a lifetime. Maybe I'll never find another friend like her. And like, partly it's because I don't want everybody. But I do want somebody who's really a real good friend. </p> And like there is one girl at work who's quite like something because she's like a foster girl background like I do. That we have lots of common ground. But like, I can't really explain it, you know. Like people do lots for you. You know like I can't help but think about like all the things Jodie's done for Eliza. And like I don't remember Eliza doing all that much for her. </p> You know, I don't mind this if this is the way you want to be. But like, well Jodie and I are more alike anyway in that way. But, you know I say to myself like, ""She likes Eliza as much as she likes me. Or just about as much. And like what does Eliza do for her really?"" </p> Like she got her the job at the school. The one I was supposed to get first of all. And you know like she keeps her going with money you know and teaching so she makes extra money. And like she's always, I don't remember ever Eliza ever asking her to go out. It's always Jodie asking Eliza. You know always asking her to go along. She's never been to her house. Well that's because of her mother mostly though because her mother is you know like doesn't like Jodie because what Jodie helped Eliza you know to progress and change a lot of her views. And kind of took her out of her grasp a little bit, you know. And it's like, well like I'm going to ask her out again. But like, Eliza has asked me out exactly once in all the time that you know. She asked me to go to a party. And it was only because she felt sorry for me because I wasn't going anywhere. </p> And partly I think, you know like I knew something I never told Jodie and that was that she got an invitation to a party in the neighborhood from this fellow from the bike shop. Well we had both been out to the bike shop together. And so the invitation, I didn't mean to read it. But it was like open or something like this and I just read it. And then I saw on the bottom, oh this was to go to Jodie. Sorry. And it said, you know, the party's going to be such and such and your roommate definitely is invited. </p> So I'm a room mate, you know. So who goes but Eliza. She asks Eliza to go. And so first of all I guess maybe there's a little bit of hurt and I kind of directed it to Eliza and Jodie both. And then I guess Eliza kind of knew maybe because I was going through really a bad period then. That was like, aww. </p> And then so like, all right so I understand why she didn't want me there because like I was like half, didn't know where I was going and what I was doing. And you know like some of the time I was still with the fellows you know like trying to get attention and everything. But it was like, hell it was like a rejection and I didn't like it. 1:04:00.5</p> Yeah. And like ok so then she then she takes Eliza and like again Eliza asks me out of almost out of I think she kind of felt bad because I think Jodie probably told her. So she asks me to go to a party. Yeah and then when I'm there she doesn't pay any attention to me because of her mother. You know it was like her mother was there so like she had to be distant. And it was like, you know I say well what has she done for me? </p> She says she loves, she really cares about me. She's got a love like a friend. And yet like what has she done for me and why should I have to be doing all this? Why should I have to be home when you invite her over for dinner to talk about your trip?</p> Why should I have to be home? You know. I didn't invite her over to dinner. You did. </p> Yeah. Well not only, the thing is that like she was, Jodie was mad at me. Jodie was mad. Because I wasn't there for Eliza who was invited over to dinner to talk about her trip by Jodie. Like why should I have to be there? </p> I don't think that's my obligation. </p> So you know that really got me peed. I'm going to have to talk to her about it because it really bugs me. You know it's like....</p> Ok. That really was one thing that really bothered me though. I don't think that was right. </p> I really don't. I don't think that's being selfish either. I just don't think that's right. </p> Well, I'm going to talk to her tonight. </p> Yeah. Thank you very much. </p> Back to the drawing board. </p>",2
1004532480.txt,"Good, um, nothing has really changed between last week and today. Um, I can't wait to be done with school. Um, I had a long week this week with work and school and everything and, um, (pause) that's, nothing's really new.</p> Uh, good. I've had like the least productive weekend so now I'm stressed about all the work I didn't do over the weekend and now I have to get done. Um, so today's going to be a really long day. Uh. [00:01:12]</p> Uh, well I had like the best intentions on Saturday, I mean Sunday to get all my homework done. Then Saturday night I ended up going out with all my friends uh, kind of like a spur of the moment. One of my friends got engaged so they all went out and then Sunday I didn't do anything so.. (laugh) I know it was fun but not very responsible. So...</p> Yeah, I know that's true. I just slept all day. Um, so, and nothing, I'm going over to my mom's next weekend for Easter brunch on Sunday, with Kyle, so it'll actually be fun. And, I think that's (laugh) I don't know. Um, yeah.</p> Well I talked to my stepmother on I guess Friday and just to see if anything had changed. And um, she seems to think that he can possibly get um probation and, I don't know if that's her, I don't know if that's realistic or if that's just her I don't know, thinking out loud.</p> Yeah, it's just the way our judicial system works that you know, but I had no idea. That he's, like this you know dragged out forever. Um, he's still living in that hotel I guess. Um, and, I don't know. I just wish something would happen so this could be over with. I, five more weeks until I'm done with school (laughter). I don't know. I just need something to change because I hate just waiting around. [00:06:03]</p> And, um, I don't know. (laughter). I don't know if...</p> I don't know, I feel like maybe at least some closure I guess or, having, it just irritates me that he's sitting in this hotel you know, basically not having to deal with anything, uh, normal talks about it you know. Um, and I really, he has yet to see a consequence I guess. That's from my perspective. Like I want him to be in jail, not I don't know, he just gets to I don't know, I don't know that it makes me feel so bad for my stepmother that she's now a single mother and he's just ordering room service and watching TV all day. I don't know that that's what he's doing, but, it's just frustrating. [00:07:41]</p> Yeah, that's always been the case, everyone sort of on their tip toes around him. Sort of, I don't know why, but just the way it's been. (laugh). And, and I just hope he doesn't get probation, you know. I don't know. Cuz I, to my knowledge he's never um, been arrested, not arrested, you know like prosecuted for something of this magnitude. Um, so. You know, there is still that chance that he could just you know get (inaudible at 00:08:46) but I hope that that's not the case you know. [00:08:51]</p> No, uh, I didn't talk to them. Uh, really about this at all. Um, well I don't know. Well one it's weird to bring up, you know. Um, and you know my little sister gets really defensive quickly you know. So, I don't want to, you know when I do see her I don't want to, I don't know, um, and my brother, is on a whole different planet. He just you know, I don't even think he, I don't want to underestimate how much he understand or doesn't understand because that would be the worst thing anyway. So, um, you know because he's twelve he's still, he's a smart kid you know, but you know, his worries consist of video games and his guitar. (laughter) [00:10:07]</p> Yeah, no, I'm, I know my step mother says that she talks to them about this whole thing. I don't know, I don't know if she does. And I keep asking if they're you know seeing anyone, which they absolutely need to, I think. Um, but she doesn't drive currently so she can't get them anywhere that's not very close to their house that they can walk to. And they have you know homework and sports and stuff after school so. It'd have to be on the weekends and you know she's just kind of putting it off I think. Because you can find someone, you know there's gotta be. [00:10:58]</p> There is, well who they have been talking to. I know my little brother sees him once during his study hour, now it's once a week. Um, for during so it's like forty five minutes once a week which you know that's great and he seems to really um, you know it's a guy and he thinks he's really cool so.</p> Yeah so. Yeah she just didn't pass anything in. She was supposed to go to school on Thursday, she walks to school and never got there and came back home after my stepmother left for work. So um, she, you know, of course they do the regular, if the child doesn't show, they call you know the parents, especially since the, and she's got a red flag on her name anyway.</p> Oh yeah.</p> Yeah, um, that's just so not her behavior you know, that to leave for school and then turn around and come home. She never would have done, you know. I think last year she had perfect attendance. Like never missed a day you know. And this year she was saying that she's missed over two weeks at this point. So, not at one time you know. Well she did actually miss a week when this all happened. [00:14:02]</p> Yeah, I could not imagine being in high school or middle school. Because most kids are being you know, (laughter).</p> Yeah. Yes. Uh, that would be awful, I mean they both seem to be doing ok, you know given the circumstances. But um, and they have a week off for April vacation, I think a week and a half so that will be good. Um (pause). Uh (pause) I think that's (unintelligible at 00:15:15)</p> Yeah.</p> I would. I would like to, but I just don't want to, I don't know how, like how to begin. And (pause) I mean you know their relationship with him is completely different than mine. I mean I've never lived with him, I don't. So, I, I mean they've always sort of known my feelings toward him so I don't want to come off looking like a bully or you know. When if they still do have you know, some, and then I don't want sit there and listen to them talk about what a wonderful father he is when they have no idea, you know? So, I, I, but I would like to talk to them. But I also wouldn't want my step mother there because um, yeah, and I'd want them to be completely honest. And as much as she's saying that she you know, she's starting to see the light and, you know. [00:16:41]</p> Uh huh. (sigh)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Ok. I've only seen them once since this whole thing happened and I was supposed to go over there last weekend, you know, this past weekend and um, you know I called my step mother and she said my sister was swamped with homework. So, because the whole point of me going over there was to spend time with her because I didn't. So, I don't know. So I didn't end up going over there. So. [00:17:47]</p> Yeah. (pause) But, yeah and then when I do see them I, you know they have so many other things going on in their lives that are good and that I want to hear about you know, rather than, I don't know, he just takes up so much time like in my thoughts, that you know I hear about my little brothers band that he's starting and the songs that he's writing. Like that's the stuff I want to talk about with him, you know, not this. You know, because I'm sure you know, that he's thinking about it just as much as I am, or more you know. I don't know but I also want him to know that I'm you know, here to talk to, so. I don't know we'll see, I just, have to get time to go over there.</p> Mmhm.</p> Yeah. Yeah. You know it took, to be done with school, have one job, you know. I've been working the whole time. Have all weekend to do what I want to do.</p> Yeah. (laughter) I know, does that really happen for anyone though?</p> Yeah. I've always had more than one job, plus school. [00:20:34]</p> I have always.</p> (laughter) Kyle always says that's Kim's ambition of the day. I'll see something, I want to do that and then I'm totally focused on that for like a week and then I forget about it. So. But I do want to learn you know a language. You know I have weeks like, you know, last weekend I had the whole weekend off and I said this is so great and I got nothing done that I actually had to get done so when I you know have like six hours between job number 1 and job number 2, and you know I have two assignments to get done, you know I get them done because it's my only time. But this weekend I was like oh I'll do it Saturday, oh I'll do it Sunday, oh I'll do it after dinner on Sunday, oh ok, I never did it. So, anxiety. [00:21:36]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. That's, I mean I watched seven hours of TV, laid in bed all day on Saturday, got up, went out and did the whole thing again on Sunday.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. So now I have to be like, so much in my time, and I'm like so mad at myself because I could have had all of this free time, I could have made this week less stressful. But.</p> I did, it was so fun.</p> Yeah, mmhm. I mean I wouldn't have missed it, so I just could have balanced you know, that. I don't know. I just didn't so whatever. Nothing I can do. You know?</p> Yeah. So. Hopefully I mean I don't have a, it's not gonna be an all nighter. But. I just, don't have, I just don't get out of school until ten, or nine thirty and then I won't get home until ten thirty.</p> Yeah so. You know I'm working and when I leave here and then after work I go right to school. In school, the last class gets out at nine thirty so. [00:24:26]</p> Yeah, and, yeah the rest of the week is like that too. But oh well.</p> (laugh) No they won't. Um, no, but then their naps are like three hours long, but they fly by. So. I don't know. (yawn). I did so enjoy a long weekend of not doing anything. Next weekend actually won't be too difficult because I'm house sitting for them but they're going away for the weekend, so I just have their dogs. So that will be nice. And then I'm doing that brunch on Sunday. Then I'll have four weeks left of school. [00:25:45]</p> I know I can't wait. Just to not have to drive there, that's the worst part. It's not as if I was five minutes away.</p> You know, but one of the, you know like last Wednesday I drove an hour and fifteen minutes up, my round trip is you know two and a half hours, to turn in a paper my professor wouldn't accept online. Like why? Like I printed the paper and put it in his mailbox and drove an hour and fifteen minutes home.</p> Like, you know, I know I shouldn't complain about things like that. [00:26:34]</p> Yeah, a total waste of time.</p> Yeah, I e-mailed him and I you know, just asked not wanting to say you know I had to leave early from work and I drive an hour and fifteen minutes each way, anyway I could you know, turn into you, and it's called like a digital mailbox. And um, he's like the assignment specifically indicates that you must drop it off in my mailbox in my office before four o'clock and blah blah blah. So. I'm like ok. [00:27:33]</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> I did deliver it.</p> I know, that's what I should have said, the side I should have taken in the e-mail.</p> Yeah. But I only have to drive there eight more times. (laughter) Cuz I have classes Tuesdays and Thursdays and then one of our, you know our exams are online so I won't have to come for those two class times at all. Eight more times. One is today. It will be great. And my family already booked their flights to come to my graduation. [00:28:40]</p> Mmhm..</p> Everything. Um.</p> I'm so excited to graduate, but terrified. And, you know and I'm looking to go to graduate school a year from next fall. So not starting in September, um, in 2013. But it's so fricking expensive that I don't know. I don't even know how anyone pays for it. [00:29:36]</p> Yeah, I've began, I've heard of that but I haven't looked into it or.</p> Yeah, til January. So but it's like, it's over a hundred thousand dollars. For two years, I don't know how. You know Kyle has a hundred and sixty thousand worth of debt right now for a four year undergrad. Uh, because we're living on student loans in our apartment too. And I was fortunate enough that my grandfather paid for my undergrad. But I mean Amherst is, um, six thousand a year? [00:30:54]</p> Um, I'm just so fortunate to graduate completely debt free. That having a hundred thousand dollars at twenty four and I've, and Kyle's twenty two and he has you know, he's in worse financial shape now than before he went to college. So...</p> It just still seems like that's so much.</p> Yeah. And he went and met with a financial counselor person, you're required to before you graduate and it's deferred for six months. But starting in December, it was twelve thousand dollars a month to pay off the debt in twelve years. Twelve hundred dollars a month would be our entire rent you know. I don't know why I'm stressing about this, he does not think about this at all and I am so stressed out about it. [00:33:15]</p> Yeah. So. I don't know. I mean millions of other college students have done it, so I guess we can to.</p> Yeah. I don't know, I just, I'll be the first person in my family to graduate from college.</p> Mmhm, so. Yeah.</p> Yeah she is. My sister went to college but she didn't graduate and my brother never went. Yeah, I couldn't imagine if I went to graduate school, I wouldn't even know what to do. But it's a thing, it's that doing it on my own. Cuz you know, they have. You know. [00:34:30]</p> So that's you know stressful and there's a whole other set of tests I have to take, and the GRE's. Which I haven't even signed up for. But I'm not behind if I'm not going to start until next year. Um, so. I'll just do it and, how people normally do it in two years?</p> Yeah, they call it a two year program but I mean it's not uncommon to do it in three or four. Right?</p> Yeah, I have to meet with.</p> Yeah. It'd definitely help, because I have no I mean, Kim's ambition of the day.</p> Yeah, and just I mean it has to be worth it for me, in the end am I really going to you know make more money because of my continued education or you know, in psychology where you have to have more education you know. But...</p> I mean does it really matter? I mean for me it would be more about the education than you know, having the letters at the end of my name you know. So, um. We'll see. But, I've [inaudible at 00:38:45] I see myself doing...</p> Yeah. And the people I work for the husband has like five degrees from Yale. Like, how... how... (laughter) So. [00:39:10]</p> Yeah, it's harder and harder to find that.</p> That would be great I just gotta find one now. Um. And, so my you know my boss is meeting with um, with the, I guess he's the CEO of a design center with my resume. We were talking and she said you know would you be interested if there was like a secretarial position? And I was like yes. So I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I'm still applying you know, not for today, not for a job today but um, but, I mean I've got like three last week, I was at. So. [00:40:39]</p> Ok.</p> I know, I used to work for a law firm and when we'd be hiring, they were putting like key words into like their database system and they would get like four hundred applications for one position. And if someone didn't have like manager in their title, they would get.</p> Yeah. But.</p> I wish I had a job already. Now that, um, I'm out of school so soon, I couldn't really start working until June anyway. Because I graduate the twelfth. And that whole, I'm taking like five days off that week because my grandparents are going to be here plus I just want the time off. Then the seventeenth myself, Kyle, my mom and my step mom are going to the islands, did I tell you this?</p> I can't wait. So, uh we're gone for eight days so. And then that brings us to the end of March. [00:43:25]</p> End of may.</p> End of May so I really couldn't start until June. So, um, but I mean I should still be applying anyway. Because if I don't have a job at graduation, I'll need to be here three times a week because I'll be seriously panicking.</p> I'll have to change because what I have now is through school. [00:44:11]</p> I think it is until August.</p> I have to look.</p> I'm covered under my step mothers plan also, so that's and the new law is you're covered under a parent until you're twenty five.</p> So, the ones through school is just much better so that's what I've been using. But yeah, I do have to look into that. Um.</p> Ok. Um, yeah, a lot will be changing in the next...</p> Yeah, and I can't wait to move into my parents house.</p> Is still an idea, um, but it won't be happening until um, Kyle graduates if it, so I mean we couldn't just pick up and move without both having jobs and a place to live. So um, I mean I'd like to see it happen after January first you know so, and then my plan would be to go to Grad School there and then um, you know if I could finish without the.... [00:46:34]</p> And that would be the end date and after that... So. Um but it's all the idea you know, so. Um, so we'd live at my parents house from August to January. Be able to save you know a ton of money you know, not paying, paying a very small amount of rent. We'd probably actually be able to swing it. But it'd just be hard for planning and finding someplace to live, you know not knowing the area at all and going out on interviews you know from Boston to... Um. [00:47:33]</p>",0
1000016550.txt,"This place eats it! God, I've never seen (sighs) ...</p> Oh, I had to park seven blocks away from here. I, you know, I was here about on the money, but then I had to go all the way, phew...</p> Ooh, my shoes are all wet. You want me to ...</p> (Breathing heavily) Oh, God. No, I drove; you know how that gets you. When you, when you - -you know I drove around here about four times and you've got all these damn one - you know when you hit a one-way street.</p> I go around this way and then I come, you know, I hit one near the place and then-and then I started running. I'm not quite in shape yet.</p> Oh, I know what it was. Did you check on the fees?</p> I think I was pissed at you last time about that. Do they give a reason? [2:05]</p> Yeah, but see...</p> Okay, right, right. But I mean, I think I have good reasons for quitting that job. Other than neurotic or whatever the...you know the other ones they have. And I think, I think some of me, you know, like I try to think it through and feel it through as to why I quit the thing.</p> And it's-the idea is not that I'm sitting on my ass all the time. I've been checking the papers.</p> But I want a specific kind of job.</p> But they're still going to leave it at that rate?</p> Oh, so (inaudible 3:11) it wouldn't do (inaudible 3:12).</p> Oh. I thought it would be more of a reduction, but they (inaudible 3:20)</p> Like, in other words-now, I haven't paid for-I haven't paid for December yet. I haven't been billed for January yet. I paid for November. For instance, if I don't pay, let's say, for January by the end of January, what kind of things would they do?</p> Well, I (inaudible 3:57) think of that. But, I mean, will they-I'll pay it. I mean it's just...</p> So that-their reasoning, then, would have been it wouldn't be that much of a deduction?</p> Yeah.</p> Well (laughs) seventy-two dollars is seventy-two dollars. It's just-well I guess maybe I'm a little pissed because it means I have to work more than I thought. I tried to get a job this morning. There was a thing with the school bus driving for about three and a half hours in the morning from six to nine-thirty which would have been really great. But it was gone already. [5:25]</p> No, but the A & P doesn't work on a sliding scale. Well, the A & P will. I mean I can-technically I can go down and get public aid on that. And then the A & P would yell out ""Food Stamps"" when I came in there or something like that. </p> I don't think A & P takes them, but...</p> Do they take food stamps? I don't know.</p> Yeah, but then I think would have started...</p> Yeah. We would have started off around thirty-three. I'm sure. But that's like hypothetical. That's not the reality of the situation. Well I, you know, I can accept that it's what it's just I want-I'm not sure why-like when I left here last year you made some comment about Julio's or something else and I said...</p> Yeah. (laughs) I said ""I don't go there, I go to these other places."" You know, in my own area. And it struck me when I left. I says ""Now, why did I say that?"" I says ""I must have been irritated at you."" Ah, hell. I don't know. Like this week I've been reading Freud's Introduction to Psychoanalysis all week long. So I got all this crap about-like, you know-unconscious thing which, honest to God, I can't. Okay, so I'm irritated...(Phone rings)...it's something that...</p> ...something that went on, but apparently didn't come out until later. And then I didn't know why I was. I think it-I think it was something like-I said ""I've got to remember that."" Because I says ""If I don't, it'll be like there's something eating at me."" [8:42]</p> ...and not, you know, I don't know if I-this is what I-I-I don't know now, whether I'm kidding myself or whether I can really trust my-at least my external reasoning. It's-it's like one of the things my Ma said when I was home. And with Susie, the girl I-that we broke up at that time. I had this whole really weird kind of things associating her to my Ma. One of the things my Ma said when I was home was I should hold onto my job. And one of the things then-I don't know if it would-at what level it was-was that one of the things I wouldn't do was hold onto my job.</p> It was like-I don't know how to explain it now. There's too many things that are bubbling around that I can't-I can't-I'm even stuttering. I can't-I don't even know where to begin today. [11:01]</p> Like yesterday-the only thing I'm aware of now is that-like I started doing these breathing exercises. It's kind of a takeoff on Zen stuff.</p> Where you just-you just concentrate your breath...</p> ...without trying to think of anything. And you don't try to keep things out, but you just try to concentrate on your breathing.</p> Your breathing. Um Hm</p> And you close your eyes. And I tried to do that like twenty minutes a day. And I did it on Monday, Tuesday. What is today? Thursday. I did it on Tuesday and Wednesday and today. All right. On Tuesday and-no I did it-I did it on Tuesday and Wednesday and today. Right. Okay. I set up this thing and I don't know. This is another thing that is really driving me nutty. The list keeping. I've got to-I've got to schedule my life now.</p> And the list keeping-I can't break it. It's one thing I truly cannot break. If I don't have it written down, I don't think I'm going to do it. </p> Things to do, books to read. I've set up a reading thing. I want to read this many books, this is there on the reading thing. This is the way I'm going to do my time. Part of it was, like with the bar thing, I wanted to avoid on Mondays and Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays I don't want go near them. Well anyhow, it worked this week. I don't know what I'll do next week.</p> And I, you know, I feel like a dodo out there. Only on Tuesday, I was like, I played like my old self and there is a couple of guys down there who I played football with who I really-I get-they play basketball like babies. That's my impression. They-well, I don't know, maybe that is a little boy's game-maybe I'm part of that, too, but... I see it more in them maybe than in myself. </p> Anyhow, on Tuesday I played good ball and I attribute it to-in some way-to the breathing exercise. Well, I did them-I did them on Wednesday, too. And on both those days I didn't do drinking or anything else. </p> I stayed home and I read. </p> Okay, Wednesday night, I went out drinking-last night. This morning, and-I met a girl and we slept together-and this morning when I got up-she had to go to work, so I got up and I read awhile this morning and I had-I did-I was high, but I didn't get bombed or anything.</p> When I-when I tried to do these things, I really became aware, I really became aware that everything was going around inside. It was like-it was like a feeling where I'm really anxious and uptight. It's like...</p> No, no, it's just general-okay, I was sitting there...</p> I don't know. It was either the drinking or-or that I had slept with this girl. Maybe a combination of the two. I got mad at somebody in the bar last night and-not angry-I just go this-very disgusted with two girls and so-you know, like-I don't know-I don't know what made it. But I couldn't-I could do them, but it was a real effort and it was like I had to overcome-I had to constantly overcome a bunch of things coming in from the outside.</p> Then yesterday-yesterday, things happened too, like I got a letter from my mother and when I get a letter from my one aunt, I have a typical way of reacting-it's going to be a long one. I don't read them, I just put them away. I can't stand to read them. And I got this letter from my Ma-usually I read my Ma's letters. I'm not really moved too much by them but I'll read them out of duty or something. And I didn't want to read it. And the first thing I thought of when I opened the letter-she mentioned that she had been in Staunton, which is where my sister lives.[16:33]</p> I says ""Uh oh, she saw the letter I wrote to my sister."" </p> And so I was really sweating it all the way through. I thought she had seen this-and I didn't-I skimmed it. I didn't really read it. I skimmed...</p> Yeah. That was about-that's all I gave a damn about and then I put it away. </p> Yeah-and I didn't even. Yeah, I didn't-I must have felt like-um-I can't put it in-I felt like-like I felt three days ago when a doorbell rang-I was-at that time-this was Sunday night and it was a girl I haven't seen for a long time who we used to-I used to sleep with. And she was over that night and in the morning the doorbell rang and I don't know who-I've noticed that-almost every morning somebody rings my damn doorbell. I don't know what's going on.</p> No. It's too early for the mailman. It was around 8:30. </p> Well, most mornings I'll ring the buzzer but nobody ever shows. So I think it's just somebody trying to get into the building. </p> But I had this-anyhow the doorbell rang-I had this feeling like-I can only describe it physically. My heart started beating faster and it was like...</p> Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was caught. You know, I'm caught. </p> Caught sleeping with a girl, you know, screwing her. [18:28]</p> Oh, man, yes. That's-and I'm certain-I was certain she had to hear my heart pounding-and I thought-maybe that-maybe that's why I was uptight this morning. </p> If I think something of the girl-you know, quite a bit-it's different. It's a little different then. But if it's somebody I meet at a bar and take home-and this way it's bad, too, because I know this girl fairly well but I don't-you know, I don't have that much feeling for her. And I mean it's just that-it's just like a...it's like a guilty feeling, I guess. That's what guilty feelings are like. </p> Anyhow it-I can see tons-not tons-I can see many different things. I honest to God, I can't arrange them. I can't see how one relates to another thing. Like I have this thing now that, either because I've read it this week or it really is part of me, that I never really have emotionally separated myself from my mother. I have never become myself. I have never disassociated. </p> I have never cut things or whatever you have to do. There was another thing on Saturday night. I had a-no, Friday night I was out drinking and a friend of mine got tickets to see a ball game, pro ball game. And so I got a date with a girl in the bar. I just asked her if she wanted to go and she said she would. So-this thing I've seen repeated. You know, in my life before. I picked this girl up and I began the whole thing by-by teasing her, what was the word-she was-spacey. Spacey is the word I kept using for her. Because she was like, slow to talk.</p> She could talk if she chose to, but she was slow to talk. </p> And so for some reason or other, I had to play this kind of like, kind of teasing game. I'm not quite sure why. Either because I felt uneasy around her or... But it was like not only teasing her, but almost like insulting her in a grinning sort of way.</p> Anyhow we were supposed to double with these other people and we were in the stadium already and this friend of mine, the guy, played ball for Southern Illinois. He was a good ballplayer. And he played some of these guys that were playing pro ball now. </p> He's real tall. He's about six three. Good-looking guy and a little Filipino girl that he's dating. And when they came in, I was dressed in a black turtleneck and, you know, just pretty plain. He came in-he had on one of these pin-stripe black suits with a dark blue shirt and a blue tie, looking sharp. And immediately I became aware of this-it's like he was better than me or he was dressed better, he knew the ball-game better.</p> I didn't think this then, but I became aware...</p> ...Right, right, right. Something clicked and immediately I'm checking out my date to see who she's looking at.</p> Yeah, right. And for the rest of the evening it was like compare and contrast. </p> And I really did-I think I really did that all evening long. And when he just had sat down he introduced me to his girl and I introduced to my date and he said-she said-he said she-his date lives at 4500 North and my-and I blurted it out-you know, I didn't really think about it. I said ""Boy, that's really G U, isn't it?""</p> Geographically Undesirable.</p> And he knew what it meant, but she didn't. And it was kind of like, kind of a tenseness there. And I didn't make any more comment about it. But I says ""Why the hell did I say that?"" In other words, ""What the hell are you-what are you taking chick way up there for?""</p> That was my initial comment. What else happened? I had the feeling-which I was almost aware of while I was having it, that my date was more animated when she was talking to him than to me. </p> And at least I knew that this was going on.</p> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. What else did he do? There was one other thing. I can't put my finger on it yet. It got really late. We went out to a couple places and had pizza and stuff. And she lived in the Old Town area and this friend of mine-he's separated from his wife and he's going to get a divorce and all this. And he had a friend of his, had moved to an apartment so he-we got up to, well the last place we were at and he says ""Hey, I know where there's a party tonight"" and I'm looking at him-I knew there was no goddamn party around. And he says, yeah there was a party. I felt weird at that point because I had never asked this girl out before and I didn't know really what was going to happen. So...</p> Yeah. So I guess-yeah, that-or I didn't know how she'd take it.</p> Because in my comparing and contrasting I had, you know, I had formed a picture of her, too. [26:59] </p> So anyhow, I said I was tired and I usually never get tired. I said I was kind of tired. And then the girl said-the girl I was with said ""Well, if you're tired, we don't have to go."" Which it-a weird reaction-it was like-it was like I felt that she wanted to go because of this other guy and not because of me. </p> And therefore, I would go just to put up-to suffer through it because I got some deal on that, apparently. </p> And so I said ""Okay, we'll go."" Well, we got there and the damn place was-the place was-he couldn't get the door open. So then we wound up going to her place and we had a drink or so there and then when I was leaving-like I wanted to get away quick. I had this feeling like-like I was sure I was never going to ask her out again. And it was like my way of getting back.</p> Yeah, yeah. And...</p> Right. And then I-and then I-the whole evening... I saw this guy the next night and I can't think if I really get to know-I don't think he has that much real-well there were other things that happened. I don't know. I can't make a judgment on him. I don't know him that well. </p> That she didn't answer, you know, if it's slushy I should help her anyway and I didn't. </p> It's like if I go out of my way to help someone I can't do it. It's for some reason-I've got to make a joke out of it. I can't just help somebody if they're-if it's a...(phone rings) [29:52]</p> I don't know-that evening I was really like a-I couldn't help it while I was doing it, but I knew what was going on. And then-you know, I-like the word ""considerate"" sticks in my head.</p> Because the other guy was very considerate of his date. I don't think I'm considerate. I'm not usually considerate. I'm patronizing-patronizing is more what I am, like... If I'm in that kind of situation where I feel like I am-I'm in an inferior position, that all these sorts of feelings go through me.</p> All the feelings like I described. In a really s...</p> Well, you know, like include her in the conversation.</p> Things like that.</p> I do that-I guess I do it both ways. Because if I would-if I would-the way I thought the other guy was toward his date was considerate. The way I thought I was toward my date was kind of aloof and patronizing in a way. Although I didn't have to be that way because she could handle herself. She wasn't a-she wasn't out of it in social situations. </p> I would think I'd be more patronizing-like if I'm in a different position-if I'm in a position where I feel more-like I know more than the person I'm with or I know more than the other guy I'm with, then it's the other way. Then I'm very-apparently I'm very relaxed and I never worry about anything. </p> The only-the only thing I can-like I thought back to this. When I was a senior in college I met a girl who was a roommate of my roo-well, my roommate's-my roommate and I-my roommate had his fianc�e and she had a roommate. And this, anyhow, to make it all work...</p> Yeah, we double-dated for the rest of the year and I always had the impression, the more I got to like her, the more the thing stuck in my mind, and I didn't recognize it, that she was more interested in my friend, Steve, that she'd much rather be with him, that she...</p> Yeah, yeah. Really, really. I couldn't admit it, you know, but it was really-oh, man-I was really-I was really strong in that. It's like they couldn't-a girl really couldn't just like me. And when she does I can't accept it. </p> It was that same sort of feeling, the same thing recurring again. And see, I can't link it up as to why it should be.</p> I mean, I'm on a kick now where, you know, like I-like this kind of therapy-I don't know what the hell other kinds of therapy are like. I think it's probably the best kind of therapy for me...</p> ...because the other kinds of therapy, if it's directed, then I'm going to get in the same shit that maybe I've got to break out of. If it's non-directed, then it's either me going to do it or, or...</p> Yeah, yeah, yeah. What I was going to say... I've been reading in-well this whole thing on the unconscious.</p> I mean it-I-I-I-what I'm trying to do is like, you know, start with Freud and not put so much stock on the interpretation as to how I can see things in myself, things that I wasn't previously aware of. See, what I don't know is if I can even-if I can-if I can even objectify myself at all-if I can get at myself.[35:43] </p> But enough things happen that cause me to really wonder what the hell's going on. </p> I can-I'm only-I just barely can see, like to me there should be patterns. There should be patterns emerging. There should be patterns...</p> ...that would say if you think you're a pile of shit (phone rings) compared to all these different people...</p> You know, okay, it's like apparently like I think of myself from the way I-you know, and the feelings I get. Okay, now those are conscious feelings. I know those things are there, but they're not at a spontaneous level, but it's like there's a time span of, let's say, an hour between when I (chuckles) know something's going on and when it actually, you know, gets way out there.</p> Okay, now. That I would say, then, would be a conscious feeling. That's something I should be able to recognize.</p> Right. I mean, if I get to know myself well enough, then I should know it ""bing"", just like that. </p> But then, then, the way I understand it now is that there are...</p> No, no, no. What I'm saying is that's what I would say would be my conscious self which I don't know, either. </p> I'm convinced I'm, you know, emotionally a cripple because I can't recognize what I'm feeling until later. Delayed action person. </p> And the unconscious things...the unconscious things, then, would not come up, you know. I'm very confused in this because if something is unconscious, then I shouldn't know consciously anything about it. </p> I mean-I, that's the way I...</p> Okay, right, right. Now, if I know now, let's say, or I'm beginning to get inklings at least part of some part of myself is that I don't think very much of myself. And I constantly compare...</p> ...to assess myself. Yeah right. And that can't be part of the unconscious.</p> How? How would it have got to the surface? That's the thing that goes through my mind. I says ""How do I know that I'm not..."" Let's say I identify a thing like that. Like it was fairly easy for me to identify labels that...(phone rings 39:13)</p> The thing like, that's kind of driving me buggy is how do I know-I'll try-I'm trying to answer it, but how do I know that my perception, let's say, of that date on Saturday, is not really contrary to what I'm really all about underneath anyway?</p> And I'm having trouble remembering my dreams. I can't remember my damn dreams. And sometimes I choose not to remember. I remember them and then I don't write them down and I forget them.</p> And see, I cannot for the life of me make the link-like for me I think I've got to find out-just in order to understand myself, you know, about my early years. And I can-the only things I can remember and I can't put them together chronologically...</p> ...is this thing, you know, with the circumcision. And my Ma said when I was home that when I was little and growing up, you know, very little, in the real-well whatever they have, the oral or whatever stages they have, you know, I was a hellion and I was impossible to control. She would beat me and things like that and I wouldn't shape up. </p> Okay. All of a sudden, when I get to be eight years old, and I start remembering things, I'm this obedient little boy who always, always in every situation-they used to-my Ma and my sister used to tease me because I'd never get mad and then they made this into a big virtue. ""He never gets mad"" that's what they'd...</p> But where? Where did I get to be that when originally, apparently, I was a fighter, I wouldn't give a damn. </p> If, if what she says is true. If she had to beat me all the time. She says she couldn't-that it didn't work.</p> And so finally, she had to resort to things like putting me in a corner. </p> I got-again, I, I, I, completely-anything before five I can remember setting a fire, I can remember some sex things, I can remember-it must be like now I still have a ...</p> I can't-before five I can't remember.</p> If I could ever peg when the circumcision thing was, that I should be able to get a date on it. </p> Like if that was in forty-five or forty-six, that would have put me at five years old and to me that seems right now to be something...</p> ...something so crucial in my mind that...</p> Yeah, but what I'm trying to establish-I want to-see, what I want to do is establish in my brain a point in time that I can relate some of these other things that I remember. </p> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because what I want to do is push it back earlier yet because I can't remember the beatings-</p> ...or the spankings or whatever you want to call them. All I can remember is things like being hit in the face and somebody really yelling hard at me and I don't know if that's real or if it isn't. </p> Because to me-to me to understand-it's incomprehensible why I would feel this way. And now I'm very conscious that I'm constantly assessing things. I think that's what I'm doing-I don't know, maybe I'm not doing that. But that's what I think consciously I'm doing.</p> Yeah, myself. It's always myself in relation to somebody. I never can just let them be, I've got to see, I've got to, it's like add them up and stack them up.</p> I-everything I read tells me that it goes back. It goes back to those early-and like I can remember high school things, too now.</p> High school things where I had the same feelings and I couldn't-then I wasn't even-I couldn't admit them to myself at all, but I remember I had the feelings. Such as, one time-this was another-some things come back to me, they're starting to come back a little, but I can't... I've got to locate a point so I can work with that. Like a thing like this: When I was in, I think my sophomore year, my sister was always very popular and starting dating-I think she was dating when she was in ninth grade. I never went out with a girl until after college. </p> One of the questions I asked when I wrote to her was how she felt about that. How did she explain that to her friends? Because a lot of her friends would have probably...</p> Either that or-no, I don't think queer. One girl said like a woman-hater. I don't know if that is...</p> No, I don't-well I don't know... If queer means that I was afraid of girls, I was afraid of them. </p> I'd get red...</p> ...when, um...</p> Not consciously.</p> I knew how I-I know how I felt toward girls. I would always feel like-I think afraid, or embarrassed (phone rings).</p> But see, then, even at that time I remember I had a saying to myself, I said ""Okay"", I said ""you can..."" there's three areas of life. There's work, friends and marriage. It doesn't really matter if you leave one out. That was one way I rationalized it. </p> Yeah. And there was a thing on...</p> Yeah.</p> I can still-you see, when I did start, I never worked it through. I never asked myself what was operating here. Homosexuality would play-would play in there some way because that's a thing it's like you wonder.</p> Yeah. See, because there's really some odd things that I have never dealt with. You know, until-I'm trying to deal with them now. [48:20]</p> Well, this thing like in high school. It was just this embarrassment. I remember one time when I was a junior-a junior in high school-the counselor who was Howie Czarsky who was a masculine kind of no shit kind of guy, who was the leader of the DeMaios which was anti-religion and all this stuff. </p> And I'm a big, you know, I uphold the faith and all that shit. And this guy was trying to get me and another guy to go to the prom. Well the prom, number one, is bad because it's dancing.</p> Good Christians don't dance. It's bad number two-well, I had these rationalizations lined up, but the big thing was I avoided him for two months because I knew he wanted to press me about asking a girl. I was embarrassed as hell just to see him. I avoided him for two months after the prom was over because I didn't want to face him. </p> It was things like I can't remember how I got money when I was in high school. I know I had a paper route late. I can't remember buying my own clothes until-in any large degree, until I was in Seminary. I remember, I looked at some of the clothes-we had sports pictures taken-and it was really weirdo clothes I was in. I mean I, you know...</p> I didn't buy them. Yeah, yeah, the clothes weren't all that good. I never paid much attention to that. You know, it was like, I think I hid behind the religion thing. I think that covered a lot of it. And I refused to allow myself to deal with anything like that because I used the religion thing to kind of-for instance, you never can think anything-well there's other things, too, behind that-but you can't think anything bad of your parents. </p> You know, because you're supposed to love and honor your parents. But, there's other things I think are deeper than that. It was just-I think of things like I really feel shitty if I shit on my Ma. I think that's more real than me using that fa�ade, you know, that layer. And it was things like in the Walter League...</p> Oh, we have this thing-the Catholic Church-this is a whole-it's-the Catholic Church is a weirdo system. It's a two million member family, three million now, but it's a whole way of thinking in there that's unbelievable, where I grew up. Anyhow, they have a youth group and they nominated me for President or Vice-President, I guess it was. And I had this big thing about denying it. I didn't want any part of it. [51:41]</p> And instead of just saying ""No, thank you, I don't choose to run"", I made a big deal out of it. I wasn't going to run and so the deaconess of the church, the woman there, she said ""It's stupid. Why not run? If they think you've got enough on the ball to run, why don't you run?"" I said ""Okay, I will"" and so I ran and I got beat.</p> And it was like going to be a priest and then being rejected by your (inaudible at 52:09].</p> I remember that I really, I was just flattened by that. I was just flattened. And even before that, a lot of times when a meeting would be over, like kids would get together-I wouldn't get together, I would just walk home and I'd feel sorry for myself. The same thing was true like in-I remember one incident in grade school where when school would be out, some of the kids would chase me. And I could always run faster-I had to run faster. If they were to catch me, they'd beat the hell out of me. </p> I think it was because I had a big mouth. </p> A lot of things. I think I would tease people. I can remember a couple-I remember one time where twenty guys were chasing me after school. And I don't remember how the hell I got into that one. That was in first or second grade.</p> I never thought of that. There was a game this one guy had where he put me in the center of a circle and he says ""We're going to play the nail game."" And so he passed out nails to everybody in the group and these guys are mad at me for some reason.</p> And when they had me in the middle, they said ""Let's get him."" And three guys hit me before I got out of that ring.</p> I don't remember! For some reason he was mad at me. All I remember is that I was tricked again, you know. I was tricked into the damn game by guys that were really my-who I thought were my friends. </p> I had about three close friends-I had four, actually.</p> Well in that instance, yeah. I mean, it's, it's the more I...</p> Yeah, and the way I would react was it just says like you-it's almost like ""You got what you deserved"" that's the feeling.</p> I don't know! I don't know!</p> Well, I do! I keep-the more I do-I push it back and as I push it back, I come up with the circumcision thing and then before that, I don't know.</p> I knew I had a big mouth and I teased people. [55:01]</p> Usually it-I can't-I'm trying to think of a specific. Well this girl the other night, it was spacey. Why do I know she was spacey? She was spacey because-it was a personal thing.</p> Spacey because she talked slow.</p> Spacey... Oh, I told her she was-watching her put her coat on was like watching grass grow. She moved slow.</p> Yes.</p> She did it, though, she really did! She took an hour to put her damn coat on!</p> Well-I-yeah, but if it's friendly, you know.</p> Well I maybe see it. It might be underneath, I don't know.</p> Yeah, okay (inaudible 56:23) still surviving. If you hear of any-do they have a part-time job thing around here, like a job board?</p> 62nd and McIntire? </p> Can I write that...Okay.</p> Oh, just straight that way?</p> Maybe I'll walk over there now. Isn't there anybody going to oppose ending this thing?</p> Oppose ending-abolishing the counseling center?</p>",2

Yeah.</p> Right. And if I try and fail, that's worse than if I don't try. I think. Yeah. And, yeah.</p> Sure.

I make them up and I'm — and the only problem that I have is that I'm very spoiled. That's my thought. That was my thought last week and it's my thought this week only stronger. And I don't know why. Maybe that's true but —</p> (inaudible at 1:08:34.2) and I don't (inaudible at 1:08:36.4)</p> I don't buy it really.</p> I really don't.</p> Maybe I don't want to accept it. Yeah. I mean I —</p> Yeah. Because I can say that I act certain ways not because of anything else except not getting my own way. I mean I can look at it like that. [1:09:10.0]</p> Yeah. It does. So I — maybe that's the truth. I don't want to accept it. I don't want (Laughs) (inaudible at 1:09:20.6)</p> Yeah. But — yeah. But I'm — I really — what I'm really wondering about that now. Yeah. I mean I'm sure that to a certain extent I am like that. And I'm thinking that maybe the reason I act all different kinds of ways is because a lot of times I'm bored. I want to be entertained or I want to (inaudible at 1:09:57.4) I don't know. Maybe it's not because I feel inadequate maybe it's just (inaudible at 1:10:03.9) I don't know. Like why not do something else? Probably that's not true. (inaudible at 1:10:17.0) I probably want to do something else for a different reason. Boy, I'm really rambling.

I don't really have any trouble I don't think now. I mean like and I'm stuck. And I am floundering on (inaudible at 1:11:30.1)</p> Because it's that I don't seem to be getting anything (ph). Maybe I am and don't know it.</p> But I sure don't know it.</p> I want to understand why I do some things or why I react to some things in the way that I do. And I think about that a lot now. Now I do.</p> Meaning since therapy.</p> And, before I just sort of accepted it. Now I'm thinking maybe that's just better. (Laughs)</p> Because I don't feel I'm going to find out why. (inaudible at 1:12:48.9) I feel (inaudible at 1:12:50.5) at all.</p> I don't know how to (inaudible at 1:13:14.2)</p> That's it. I think I don't know what — I come in here and I talk about things.

But probably things happen that I forget about that. I mean some things bother me. But I think well I've always talked about something like that.

[1:16:02.0]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> (inaudible at 1:16:29.0) I don't know if it makes any difference.</p> No. If it makes any difference that I talked about it.</p> (inaudible at 1:16:53.1)</p> (inaudible at 1:16:56.6)</p> I only do that when I'm (inaudible at 1:17:07.1)</p> Sometimes. Yeah. I guess (inaudible at 1:17:45.9)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. If it's something that is — something (inaudible at 1:18:01.5) Some things are just the same and I know that I — [1:18:06.9]</p> There seems to be a problem (inaudible at 1:18:10.3) or really I don't know think about them anymore. (inaudible at 1:18:15.0) And, I didn't want to talk about this when I came in here (inaudible at 1:18:28.3)</p> Yeah. (Laughs) I feel like I'm always talking about this.

[1:19:02.9]</p> I keep hoping it will if I talked about it (inaudible at 1:19:09.9) Plus sometimes when I talk like I start telling you one new point like in therapy and then I (inaudible at 1:19:27.4)</p> I mean like I say to you nothing's happening yet. I think well, no that's not really true.</p> Sure. Like there's nothing really (inaudible at 1:19:51.9) at all. Really.</p> Yeah. Maybe that's (inaudible at 1:20:04.0) I'm not thinking about (inaudible at 1:20:16.4) think about those (inaudible at 1:20:19.1)</p> Not that I'm (inaudible at 1:20:33.2) One of them is I don't have anger. When I get angry or then I'm feeling (inaudible at 1:20:45.3) but I'm also thinking that — I'm thinking of what the other person is — trying to think of what the other person is feeling. And I really end up putting myself in the wrong (inaudible at 1:21:00.3) or — it's like I never feel I'm all — [1:21:07.4]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> A lot of the time, I think (inaudible at 1:22:16.0) Maybe that's not (inaudible at 1:22:18.9)</p> Yeah. Maybe. Like a lot of times (inaudible at 1:22:29.2) before anybody else no matter what it is.</p> But without having anything else to do (inaudible at 1:22:51.9)</p> Yeah.

Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> (inaudible at 1:23:31.7)</p> I don't know.

Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. Nothing — yeah, nothing really is important most of the time. I'm trying to think if I make it that way. I don't know. [1:25:22.6]</p> Maybe nothing is important. See. Really.</p> (inaudible at 1:26:54.5)</p> Okay. [1:27:09.4]</p> This is hard. I knew what you were going to say while — before you said it. And I'm still (inaudible at 1:27:14.5)</p> Oh. I'll do it.

And there was no reason for me to be bored or upset, I was (inaudible at 1:28:28.6) I was (inaudible at 1:28:30.0) And I wanted something to do and I didn't do anything. (inaudible at 1:28:39.7) And, any of the feelings that I felt were just because I think I didn't want to go. I didn't know what else I wanted to do but I wanted to do something else or do something exciting that I (inaudible at 1:29:12.2) and I didn't do anything at all. And I was just waiting for somebody to do something for me (inaudible at 1:29:21.6) [1:29:21.7]</p> And that's the way I feel a lot of times. Like even when I (inaudible at 1:29:56.0) I think that I'm just looking for attention. (inaudible at 1:30:03.4) I must have been —</p> If some — if somebody else doesn't want to do the things, I usually (inaudible at 1:31:01.3) anything I want to do especially. And I go along with whatever anybody suggests. (inaudible at 1:31:07.0) when I do, I'm resentful. Because (inaudible at 1:31:17.4) I want all the attention centered on me. But mostly why I'm like (inaudible at 1:31:32.7) [1:31:34.6]</p> And I think (inaudible at 1:32:07.7) if I don't get my own way. And I know I (inaudible at 1:32:11.8) And I start depending on (inaudible at 1:32:17.9) [1:32:17.9]</p> (inaudible at 1:33:10.1)</p> (inaudible at 1:33:22.8)</p> (inaudible at 1:34:41.6) I'm not (inaudible at 1:34:50.8) that I am (inaudible at 1:35:00.9) But I stop myself and I think (inaudible at 1:35:18.1) I don't know what it is but I know what I (inaudible at 1:35:24.1) But I do have feelings about some (inaudible at 1:35:50.7) but I just (inaudible at 1:35:53.9) [1:35:55.2]</p> (inaudible at 1:36:13.7)</p> I don't know what to say (inaudible at 1:36:44.5) Even when I'm thinking (inaudible at 1:36:49.0)</p> (inaudible at 1:37:39.1) I don't know what to say. Really.</p> Because the things that I was thinking of before, I completely (inaudible at 1:37:47.5)</p> Yeah. I am. I don't know why. (inaudible at 1:37:56.2)</p> Yeah.</p> It's not that I didn't want to (inaudible at 1:38:19.1) When I was first (inaudible at 1:38:27.1) but they are. I've completely gone through my head. And everything I was thinking of it's like you know that's not true. Because of — because you really feel — and (inaudible at 1:38:56.5)</p> I know. It's too good, isn't it?</p> Yeah. (Laughs) (inaudible at 1:39:13.4)</p> It was (inaudible at 1:39:22.7) and I couldn't stay here. I couldn't stay here when I was over there.</p> In fact a lot of times I'm conscious of thinking boy, I couldn't take that on another day. Or I'll be able to think boy, what's wrong with me? But you can't take that. And I'm (inaudible at 1:40:07.1) both times and I'm different. But I like the first way better. [1:40:12.9]</p> I do.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> I think they really hurt.</p> But this thing is that I try not to like them and I think to myself that it's ridiculous even if it's (inaudible at 1:40:50.4) We were going to this picnic that I'm planning on Saturday morning. I'm usually kind of (inaudible at 1:41:02.2) And I started off (inaudible at 1:41:06.5) and getting depressed because I didn't want to go to this (inaudible at 1:41:11.4) And we were riding out there. I don't remember. There were a bunch of people. And I think it was like (inaudible at 1:41:48.1) James was making fun of my singing. (inaudible at 1:41:51.6) But that day, it wasn't okay at all. And I forgot what I was going to say about it. Oh, even at the time I thought that it was wrong for me to feel like that because I was letting myself do that. I was letting myself react. [1:42:16.0]</p> That's it. That's the word. (inaudible at 1:42:19.7) yourself.</p> We don't talk about (inaudible at 1:42:45.6) (Laughs) And I'm really hungry.</p> That's exactly right. Both things are exactly right.</p> Yeah. I guess so.</p> In a way. On the way down here, I was thinking that I — whatever (inaudible at 1:43:54.9)</p> Well that's what I was —</p> Sometimes it's — yeah. It's like strange or something. But it's because I feel like the way I should do usually — not —</p> Not — yeah, not always.</p> Oh. No. I didn't mean that. That's what I meant not always.</p> I mean like I don't feel happy or something. And I'm trying real hard to do it like that. That's what I meant.</p>",1
1000094547.txt,"He had told me, now this is really getting personal but, he had told me that he had had sex with his last boyfriend. That is the only time he had ever had actual sex with a guy. Because I have never done that. And, um -</p> Like actual intercourse, you know, intercourse or whatever. So, good thing I am such [inaudible]. And he, so anyway, he had said that it had been with this guy Dan. Well along he has been talking about Dan. Dan and him had moved to San Francisco together. Dan had gone to sings together. Never saying that they had a relationship, he never told me that they had an intimate relationship. So even though this is three years old and Dan isn't really around anymore. Dan and him are just friends and I'm not threatened by Dan. Dan has a boyfriend that lives in Aspen,  Colorado  whatever. </p> Yeah, well it's off for the summer. And I probably shouldn't have looked in his notebook, but I did. And I found two little journal entries he's written in February about Dan. So, and I didn't tell him this because I can't, because I've got so many problems right now, I don't need more stress. You know what I mean? Not from big problems, but you know, little, uh disturbances. So he basically had written how he was struggling about his feeling with Dan, but he really wanted, knew that it was just habitual and that he really needed to move on to a new relationship and meet somebody and this is all before him not me. And meanwhile I was seeing someone at that time anyway. But the point is, is that even through he said his feelings for Dan were over a long time ago, it's not true. He was struggling with them. Now I am very well, you know, can understand the fact that, duh he wanted to meet somebody new, he was working the way he needed to work to resolve his feelings with Dan, and that's okay and that's good. But somehow still it made me feel a little bit and sore inside. Just kind of like uh, you know just kind of bothered me.</p> I don't know why. Because maybe somehow it just made me feel like he wasn't really sharing himself with me and letting me really know what was really going on with him. Instead he was just kind of giving me the, the pin up picture of it, the best version. 0:02:41.1</p> I'd like to know what is really going on. You know, I'd like to know exactly what he is really thinking so that then I understand.</p> No, you're right. He doesn't exactly what goes on with me. No. So. But see this is all comes back to what's bothering me because I wish that we, I want to be in a relationship. I wish that, see this is it, I just feel like I need to be with somebody. And I feel like alone and like I need somebody's help, I just, not to help me, but just to be with me. Because I am just so miserable when I am by myself half of the time, that I just feel like if I had somebody with me that I would be okay. Maybe I wouldn't.</p> I don't know, maybe I am just miserable. I don't know. I am just feeling like I'm worn out right now. Because I haven't slept very much for like two weeks, because last week was school and I had all that stuff going on and all these things have been going on and I just, I don't spend any time with myself like I used to. And I am not happy where I am living. And, you know, -</p> Okay, so can you just control the situation entirely and tell me what's going on.</p> Well that is what I mean.</p> I don't know. By distracting me. </p> By distracting me probably from what's really bothering me. By loving me, so I feel loved and appreciated. By giving me attention and making me feel like someone does really care about me and that I am ok. By validating the fact that I feel the way the I do, as far as like my need to be with this person in this relationship. I mean I'm at a point in my life where I want to be, like, I want to like be in a relationship where I am like living with someone and I want to just move forward. I don't want to keep going through these same kinds of relationships all the time. And it is almost like, that's the thing that I hate about, well that is not true, that's a stereotype, but it's like just like if I was with a woman, I'd be like engaged or married and have kids. Because I just feel like, I know how to naturally progress in that relationship. I know how to do that. And with him, he's living at home, his sister is involved, you know, he's going to move to Italy and it's another month of me waiting to see what is going to happen. </p> You know.</p> I know because I am saying a lot and it's not very clear. But, he is. Like we sat down and had a talk the other night and I said to him this is what I expect, you know, out of a relationship. Like this is what I think is important and I want to see it growing forward and he is like ""you're right,"" like he agreed. And he wants to be a part of that and I can feel that and he makes an effort every time I am with him.</p> No this was Sunday night. But, meanwhile he has got his own problems. He's an individual, he's probably not, you know, completely happy living at home, I don't know. But, you know, and he has to deal with his sister, which I know upsets him even though he loves her. And he doesn't know if he is going to go to Europe or not. So, he has got all those other things besides the fact that I am sure at some point he's dealing with our relationship. But it is just a clear sign to me of how I feel when I say something to him like well do you even think about our relationship, knowing he does. Which is saying, you know, do you? Because you don't talk to me about it. I said I am pretty much the instigator, I talk about our relationship to you, and you respond. </p> Maybe just, you know, once in while say how he feels about our relationship in some sort of validating form. 0:07:36.9</p> For example, you know, I'm so glad, like stuff he used to say. Like I am so glad that I met you, our relationship is so good, I am so happy that I am here with you. </p> No he just more shows it through action, he's just more like in this other world. And I think, I said this to him and I think that I am right. The more I confirm things for him, the more I give him, the less he needs to give me, because he is too busy responding to what I'm giving him. And that is [inaudible] a need in him that isn't, you know what I am saying. That's me leading him already because I am giving him all the validation and comfort that he needs in our relationship. So why does he need to do it then back to me, because he is already confirming it to me by responding to me. But I need him to enable himself to be the one that presents it first, but maybe that mean that I need to shut up for a while. </p> No, I don't tell him I love you, but I tell you know, I just talk about our relationship and stuff. And talk about like, you know, if he comes over, like I am so glad you came over, I am so happy to see you, well hey, you know. And he does that kind of too. But, you know, like right now, I just started getting really anxious and that has been a problem for like the last three days, I've been having really bad like anxiety like I just feel like I am go like crazy and explode and like you know, like I'm not going to [inaudible].</p> Just in general. And I think that's just being overwhelmed. Because like last night, I thought I was going to have a break down all day yesterday because I was so tired and I didn't want to go to work and I'm just so, you know like, ugh. And -</p> That feels like, you know, when your head is just all clogged up, I have really bad allergies anyway, but when you just feel like, you're overwhelmed basically. You're overwhelmed by life, by the things that you know are going on. Not knowing where to turn.</p> I don't know that is the scary part. Probably nothing. Because I feel all these feelings and then I go to work and work all night and everything is fine. So obviously this is all in my head, its too much coffee with no food, too little sleep. I've always been weird with too little sleep, my whole life. And too much stress, you know. I mean I just feel like I want to like to go like my fantasy is Betty Ford Clinic. I just want to go to Betty Ford and have people like help me get over all this stuff. And like I want to quit drinking and I want to feel good about myself. And I want to just feel strong. And I feel all the opposites. I feel weak, even though I know I am strong. I feel tired, even though I know that I am not always. I feel, you know, needy, even though I that I know that I am not completely. </p> Weak, just like oh my god, like I just want just go ugh, it's over. Not over my life, but its over just like this fight just to survive constantly. You know and everybody does it, but I just feel like I need, like I just need to find, I need to find power within myself to lift myself up and go forward. And just push forward. </p> The weakness is, just, I want to be consumed with my own life and not just with my life with like for instance Carl. You know.</p> I guess.</p> It is a weakness that I don't feel empowered as a person. That I feel, you know, I get pangs of empowerment and I am not following through with it. I say I want to quit chewing, and then I throw away my chew can and then everyday I buy another one. I say I don't want to drink, and then I get oh well, I am going to go out and drink and then I am hung over the next day. I say I don't want to, you know, I don't know, go out. And then I go out. But like last night, I went out dancing, even though I was so tired, and it really made me feel better inside. It made me feel happier. It like gave me like a huge release, because I can go on the dance floor and I can just be an individual. There I feel completely empowered to be on my own. I don't anyone to touch me, I don't want anyone to be with me, and I can be me. And I don't have to share it, I mean I am sharing it, but I don't have to like give of me in a way that makes me feel like I'm, you know, having to give up myself. You know, be more vulnerable or open myself up to someone. Like even in this way I have to open myself up to you, otherwise it is not going to work. It's not going to work if I sit here, you know, I have to open myself up to you so that, so that have a productive meeting otherwise I'm going to feel bad.</p> I just mean, you know, I'm just speaking of the difference of doing something for me and then doing something for that is more painful for me to do, like give up part of myself. </p> Well at the expense of my comfort. Its helps that I get more comfort for this experience.</p> Because it causes me to be anxious and deal with all the things that I am dealing with. At the same time, you know, very fulfilling, I was excited to come here and talk about all these things. Because finally I have someone I can talk to about that is objective and that I know you are sober. I know you are going to be able to give me, you know, be rational with me. And I can trust that. You know. I mean when I look at my life I think I have a pretty good life, you know. But I just think I could have so much more if I could just find a way to be focused. And I am not talking about material things anyway, I'm talking about fulfillment of my inner being, you know. My inner self of me, you know. But its, you know, like yesterday all I did was I've been having a lot of really strong dreams, dream imagery has been all day long in the back of my head, a lot of childhood memories lately that are with me during the day. Plus all this stuff that I am dealing with and I just, and when I say I just want to take a break, it's because that just all feels to overwhelming to me. Like it does right now, it's just like I don't know how to deal with it all. You know. And I've been here before. </p> Oh really?</p> That's scary.</p> Because I don't know. Because I am scared right now. I'm starting to feel anxious now, because I am just feel scared talking about all this stuff that is really bothering me. I don't, it's just overwhelming, you know, protect me somehow. You know what I mean?</p> No. So it's sad and it makes me even sadder. I'm just, I am sad because I am sad about the fact that I am not doing what I think I need to do make myself a better person and a stronger person. And I just want to be, you know, I just I deserve to be happy. And I understand how to be happy. But I am not following through with what it takes to make myself happy. You know. And I don't trust a lot of people around me right now. You know. And here I am in New York City, you know, its just like ugh, you know. I feel like I just need to sleep for like three days and like that is why I just want to go to like Betty Ford. I want to like just sleep.</p> Because I don't feel like I can allow myself to sleep, one. To take the time to just sleep, I feel like I can give myself that. </p> Well I am afraid that if I sleep that I'm I don't know, I am not dreaming anything.</p> I don't know. It's so loud anyway. I can barely sleep. I guess I'm going to make it through all this. I just, I mean this all better be worth it. Some thing really big and nice must be coming my way, because I'm like, this is like sucks, you know. 0:16:04.6</p> Well you're right because like half of the day I have to just tell myself, well this isn't really worth that and the other half I just have to go you're okay. MY mind doesn't say you're okay. You know just confirm that I am okay. You know. So now, I'm just ready to have a full on anxiety attack so I need to calm down.</p> I think it's true. It's really true.</p> No but I'd like to how to [inaudible]. 0:18:09.8 </p> I shouldn't have had an espresso before I came here.</p> I shouldn't have had an espresso before I came here because I am like eeeee. Oh I just get really buzzed off coffee, it's probably not good for me. </p> I just feel -</p> Just a little anxious, that's all.</p> Just I guess felt overwhelmed like I just don't know what to do. And I am, I don't want to focus on it because it is going to make me like. I don't know I just feel like, just because everything you are saying makes complete sense, you are totally right. But its like you know, I just have to use, I have to take action, I think. Maybe, you know.</p> I just to have like starting doing things to make me feel better because I am sending head shots out to agents. Do things that are active and then I will probably feel a lot better. 0:19:39.5</p> Like, you know, actual actions instead of just thinking about them which is worry. To actually do something proactive to take myself forward. Or sleep.</p> Yeah.</p> Well I am just wondering why, I don't know, why I am so like why I am so dependent on this relationship of like, you know, why am I feeling fear about it when, when I know its all good. And that's just, you know, I'm afraid it's going to go away. You know. But that might just be because of the fact that a lot is going on with it and with everything. And I don't know if he going to go, like he says even if he goes to Italy for a month then, you know, what does that mean? We can't be together when he comes back? No. We've only been going out for tow, two and half months. And now he's going to leave for a month, that is half the time we've been going out in the first place. And I know me, and I am afraid I'm not going to be able to, you know, I get, people like, I meet a lot of people all of the time that I probably have, you know, relationships with. And he'd just hope that I'd be strong enough to last a whole month, and that sounds horrible. You know, but that is true. 0:21:06.1</p> I think I was fine. I probably was irritated at first just because I was like eh, now I have to wait a whole another week.</p> It probably bothered me. I don't think I consciously thought about. But I think initially I was a little bit irritated. But, you know, I try to understand. That's my way of dealing is go well I'm sure a good reason and I just try to understand. So I am sure that is what happened. So. </p> I know. But yeah, it just like everybody is always doing things and I just feel like I want to be doing things too. That is what I need to do. </p> I want to be traveling. I want to go to Italy. I want, you know, do things. </p> I know, but that is just the way that I am. You know, I feel like my life should be like more. I always say this to you. I've got way too much energy and too much going on, that why I need, but I have to create it, [inaudible] more. I mean there are young people, like I keep saying, my age who are, you know, doing more. Lot more. And that to me is exciting and I want that. You know. I mean how, there is people my age that are walking on sets and seeing Robert DeNiro. Even they are only saying one line with Robert DeNiro, that's living. You know, that's to me is an actor. That's living. You know being on the studio sets are so exciting. That's living. You know. 0:23:01.1</p> I know. Is that bad? Probably.</p> [laughing]</p> I am laughing. </p> But it's good though.</p> yeah, I do that in some ways.</p> I did that last night.</p> You're right. It does snap back.</p> Yeah.</p> Off into like the clouds, like ugh. Now I have to figure out how to go on with the day. I'll be fine. 0:24:53.4</p> [inaudible] collapse, like ugh.</p> Physically like, I'm just tired, that's all.</p> Yeah. </p> Don't worry about it, I mean I'm fine.</p> I think that, you know, I just wanted you to tell me that what I was feeling was okay. And you know, because I feel like it isn't. And then, and that is all that I wanted from you and I didn't get so it makes me feel frustrated.</p> Well because I just wanted to know what I am feeling about Carl and all these feelings that I am feeling maybe, that those feelings are okay.</p> That I am not being, you know, I think I am being pretty appropriate actually.</p> Appropriate. </p> I feel like they are appropriate to the circumstances. Maybe I just wanted confirmation that that was true.</p> Or that it wasn't and that maybe that I needed to look at it from a different perspective. </p> Uh uh. </p> Well I think I want this opinion because I feel so worn down and I feel kind of like, like I do feel like I'm going to have a nervous breakdown or something. And I know I [inaudible]</p> I'm going to have a nervous breakdown or something because I am so tired and so like confused, but. I know that I am not going to because I watch everybody else around me, I mean they are far worse usually. And I know that I am just overtired and that is it. But I feel that way, so I want somebody to tell me that it's not going to happen. That I am going to be okay. When in reality I know that I am going to be okay. But I think that [inaudible]</p> [laughing] Probably. Probably.</p> Ugh the catch word.</p> I know.</p> I could call them. They have scholarships. I could leave New York and go off to Betty Ford. That would be a great story.</p> For me to tell.</p> For me to tell, uh I went to Betty Ford for a while. [inaudible].</p> Okay. 0:29:36.7</p>",0
1000013366.txt,"I wanted especially to be here on time today. Actually I left about 4:00 and then my radiator overflowed and the car's stranded up in Oakland. (inaudible @ 0:12)</p> Yeah. I made it there and then it was gone but it's symbolic in some respects because I had a lot of really, really, really, really wonderful thoughts in preparation for the session why I was so anxious to get here because -</p> Yeah, something really clicked for me and the two things - I want to kind of deal with the thing that kind of clicked for me and then this phenomenon that I experienced of having these seemingly very, very clear insights that I figure are wonderful organizing principles for my life which don't necessarily stop working but ultimately get superseded weeks or months later by yet another overriding, organizing principle. A big one for me several weeks ago was ""all you can do is all you can do"" which seemed to resonate with me but the thing that's really on my mind now is the ""high-tech, high-touch"" phrase which I hadn't read in years and years but came back to me and [didn't make a lot of sense for me] (ph). I continue to deal with this obsession, compulsion I have about wanting to come hug and snuggle up with the women in my life. Women that I - along the way I was even thinking to myself, ""I'd love give you a hug sometime"". What is that about? And it occurred to me somehow - I was trying to figure out how exactly I got to that insight but I remember from John Nesbit's Mega Trends, ""high-tech, high-touch"" was a concept of the more technological we get the more there's a need to get very earthly, very kind of centered as a counter trend to technology. [2:27]</p> Yeah.</p> Well, just the hugging, the touching in my life which has - for the last year and a half - mostly been around Jemma, has been very gratifying but in some way restricting to me. And the anxiety or the fear that if I married Jemma or got totally in touch with Jemma, stayed in a relationship with Jemma, I would in effect, limit the opportunities to physically hug other women that I feel close to, feel a connection with. That really came home to me. As I was thinking about how I was going to explain this to you, I said to myself, ""You know I sit here and I so much look forward to my sessions with Julie and the tremendous amount of feeling and thinking that I prepare for it with in terms of - and how, just in relating to you as a woman - it's really helped ground me in my manhood and really has awakened this need to touch and hug, It's reminded me of how wonderful that feels for me. [9:01]</p> And then to be able to talk about it.</p> Well, it's wonderful to be able to talk about it. I mean this is pretty bold stuff for me to be talking about hugging your therapist. So I'm pleased that I feel able to express it to you. I don't begin to think that within the ethical restraints of psychotherapy that it would be permissible to you to do it even if you wanted to. So I can respect the fact that it's probably something that won't come about; at least not [with the camera on] (ph). But then again, I don't know. I don't know what training; what ideas percolate through the work that you've done on yourself and the people and maybe - I can conceive that is some schools of psychotherapy, they may say, ""If it feels like a good thing to do, why not? Give your patient a hug."" [13:35]</p> I think it would be a sense of just tremendous - it would give me a chance to be that much closer to you; to share a very special experience and to have you know how - it would be in a way some symbolism to it. Just  -</p> Just the togetherness; the fact that we've jointly engaged in a life changing experience for me. And hugging is a symbolic way that people who've kind of come through an experience - whether it's a brief social experience or a major life changing experience - to usually have some physical connection to kind of celebrate the beginning or end of what they're doing together. So it makes a lot of sense for me in that respect. [14:45]</p> Some celebration of what we've done together. [Just the pleasure] (ph) of holding you and being held by you I think would fulfill a little fantasy in my mind. It would be nice to have some kind of physical connection to you. And it just kind of takes me down a road of wanting to be more physical with the important women in my life. I have no interest whatsoever in hugging men. But I want in this next period of my life to have a lot of wonderful women friends and in a profound way to connect to them and to feel that the non-verbal communications between us can say as much as the verbal because there's so much noise that comes out. [16:08]</p> Well, there's a lot of talking; a lot of intellectualizing and I know that that's something I've done all my life. I've been recognized by the women of my life as being a very articulate spokesman for what it is that I have to say.</p> Well, there's a time for stopping to talking and just feeling and sensing and experiencing in a non-verbal way and just see what comes up. It would be a curiosity, you know? What would it feel like? I don't know. I think it would feel very, very warm and wonderful; very, very gratifying; very, very - it would be a moment of shared intimacy that would be something different from if you've never done it before, I imagine it would be very distinct for you. If you've done it before maybe - I don't know. I'd love to hear what your experience of it would be. And I'd love to see what my experience of it would be. I think it would bring us even closer together and perhaps - I mean, with each week I feel that I'm exploring more and more of the terrain around me. The essence of who I am and what I'm all about to the extent that it may unlock even more of these kind of deep core feelings about what I am and this obsession about getting to the essence of how I can best organize my life with women because does it - by breaking up with Jemma or transitioning with Jemma from this exclusive, monogamous relationship we've had which looked like it might settle me into a very comfortable traditional path of being in a permanent committed relationship with her - as I become more convinced that that's not what I want for my life - [18:34]</p> I don't want that. I think I want to have a want to the extent that Jemma will let me do it to be very important to her and have her remain important to me but I don't want at this point to be restricted in being able to connect with other women. I think I've crossed that  -</p> Well, I do recognize that - and what I said then I think I still believe - that it is a way to kind of cut through a lot of the niceties and the bullshit of life that these non-verbal - that there's so much crap and garbage in the talking out of feelings that the actual physical contact - I talked then about going to bed with a woman to know that when she says that she likes me or respects me or appreciates me that it's a more definitive expression of how close she feels to me if she wants to engage in something as incredibly intimate as being in bed together. But I think that as I've thought about it a little bit more, I don't know if it has to go that far. I don't think it has to be such a quintessentially sexual experience. I think it can be enough to get a - I think that in the feelings that go into just a hug with a woman  -</p> I think it might stand for the same thing.</p> Validation and approval and just pure pleasure in having me as a companion and a symbol of a potentially long, enduring connection that we would be forming; that we would kind of come together as symbolic of the beginning of a friendship. A friendship where we could each reliably count on each other to listen, talk through and be there for each other and enjoy doing things with each other. If ultimately it led to something more intimate than just a fully clothed hug, that's one way it could go. But if it became nothing more than just a - [22:23]</p> No. I think that's a fantasy but it doesn't feel like it needs to go in that direction. I think that's a little off the wall. I think that's a little bit  -</p> The hug stands for - right, but in a socially acceptable way; in a way that doesn't  -</p> Well, it stands for approval and good feelings and connection and warmth and celebration and just many, many, many wonderful things that I associate with more intimate physical contact with a woman in any way. My approach to having a sexual relationship with a woman is no longer what it used to be which was - in my 20s - much more of a predatory kind of thing. It was all about me and getting my rocks off and all that. And then it's come in the last several years to be much more about these feelings that I'm talking about today; a celebration and warmth and approval. But in a way that was not exploitative; that was not predatory; that made it feel as warm and wonderful to my companion as it was for me. So that it would definitely not be something that I would want to do if somebody didn't want it; wasn't as gratified by it as I was. So it's evolved into a much more sharing and egalitarian and just along those lines. Because that's what's come back to me from Jemma that she feels like she has grown and deepened and gained a great deal about self-respect; of empowerment in her negotiations with her husband in the divorce; just a good feeling about herself as a result of the relationship that we've had for the last year. So it's reminded me that a wonderful physical relationship between a man and a woman that's based on non-exploitative, non-predatory, very shared open feelings of just wanting to support each other can be extraordinarily wonderful for the woman as well as for [Buds] (ph). [25:49]</p> Well, there was some - yeah, in some ways I think the (inaudible @ 26:22) worldview of what's  -</p> Yeah. So it is tough because it's not the kind of thing that society expects of middle-aged men. I'm more expected to be settled in my career and family and to be leading a much more traditional life. I've wanted to burst out of those chains and be very, very - and develop many warm - you know, have more experiences like what we're having.</p> Well, they do. I would agree with that but at the same time were it my luck to fall into a school of therapy whose therapists are open to hugging their clients that would be wonderful. But I accept the fact that that might be the rare school of therapy that endorses that. It might be counter to - I mean, I know that there are certainly restrictions on  -</p> Yeah, maybe that's a good question to ask. Yeah. You have not been in the past been too receptive to answering questions I've asked but it can't hurt to ask. Is there anything in your ethical - in the particular therapy that you're trained in that speaks one way or another to hugging your clients?</p> Okay.</p> Okay.</p> You do?</p> Can you elaborate on that?</p> [Why? Why?] (ph) Is that a general principle that applies to all the therapy that you do or is that just particular to my case? Were I somebody else where the circumstance -</p> I just asked the question.</p> Well, I respect the answer you gave me. It was not unexpected but I guess I wanted - it wasn't entirely clear to me whether you wanted you felt that because of the particular place that Aidan was coming from any kind of hug or physical connection between us would be bad for our particular work as opposed to somebody else. You might say, ""I'm not foreclosed generally from hugging my patients if that's what I think is the right thing to do but I just don't think in your case it's the right thing to do.""</p> Well, then it might say to me okay I can - at least my idea was not so wacky that it's totally farcical to think so that it would be nice to hear that the idea of a therapist hugging their patient is something that Julie can theoretically or hypothetically do.</p> Okay, well then I would be that much more stimulated to kind of find out what is it about me that makes it not appropriate. But at least to know that the idea itself was one that - [31:54]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Well, I guess I've just imbued very much now with kind of the excitement of this idea that I have that hugging between patients and therapists and hugging between Aidan and important people in Aidan's life can be just wonderfully stimulating and gratifying and just carry all kinds of positive implications. [32:48]</p> Well, it might send me a message that the path that I've outlined today is - at least in your view given all that you know about me and all the work that we've done - it might send me a message that you know keep going with it. ""You're making - as your analyst, Aidan, I'm happy to hear that you're making good progress and I want to send you a message that from my point of view it feels right."" It would be nice again to have some symbol of your approval or your - yeah, it would be a nice way of hearing from you that you agree with me and that you are feeling that our therapy is going - I don't know, for example, whether you feel that our work from your point of view is going in a direction that you as a therapist approve of. [34:11]</p> Yes. Yeah and I'll tell you why. Because I said the other thing that I wrestled with all week is the fact that these organizing principles or mantras come and go so frequently. And I would love to be able to get my arms around one so to speak and hug it to death and say, ""This is one that really this time feels so right, you know, I should like write it on my palm.""</p> Missing?</p> Well, I think that I  -</p> Well, I think I mentioned and I think a lot of this goes back to the fact that so much of my upbringing with my mother was so kind of loveless and empty and so I think there was a lot missing from my first marriage. So until I think about the age of 40, I think there was a lot missing from my life. And I think in the last 10, 12 years, I've worked very hard to kind of make up for that 40 years. And I think I feel now that I think I'm on to something but I'm not sure because I've had so many prior insights that I thought were life changing and turned out to have kind of just melted away over time. So it would be wonderful to know that this particular sense of being very centered and grounded around this kind of high-touch concept as a counter to the technological frenzy that I'm living in that maybe this time I've really got it right. And you as somebody who has listened to me and knows something about me is encouraging me to go along with it. It kind of feels right to you. [36:33]</p> Okay. Alright. Good. Fine.</p>",1

I mean our choir director's really nice and he's not mean about it, but (pause), it was still really embarrassing. (Pause), (clears throat), (pause), so those are the highlights of what's been on my mind the last two weeks.</p> (Chuckle), (pause).</p> (Pause), it's a little embarrassing. I kind of don't want to talk about, but it has been bugging me. (Pause), so there's, (pause), this pattern, (pause), in kind of, my sexual fantasies, where I often find myself fantasizing about, well, people who would be completely inappropriate to have an actual relationship with, but who are also, (pause), significantly older than me, and in kind of positions of authority and/or mentorship with respect to me. [00:09:38]</p> Well when people talk about like—your Freudians sexual obsessions, they're usually talking about obsessions men have towards women.</p> Or at least in the colloquial sense.</p> I don't know what the technical—</p> (Chuckle).</p> Not really, (pause).</p> Because I'm really, really embarrassed about it.</p> (Pause), well, (pause), part of it is that most of the individuals in question are not what the average person would describe as attractive. So there's that and then there's, (pause), there's a couple of mentor figures who I see socially that I don't know from work or from school, who are part of my network, either through alumni association or through my church. </p> Right. It's outside of my head and now—[00:12:12]</p> Yeah. (Pause), (sigh), (pause), which I mean, it's not about you or my trust in your ability to maintain confidentiality—</p> Or anything like that, it's just—</p> Okay, yeah.</p> (Pause), I mean, and this has been something that's been bothering me for, (chuckle), a very long time now, but (pause). So I ran into one of these people yesterday in dress rehearsal for this Russian choral thing.</p> So I have it on my mind today.</p> (Pause), and Dave actually said something about it when we got home. He was like, I noticed you were avoiding so and so at practice. Is it because of that weird thing his wife said to you four years ago? I was like, okay it's obvious that I'm avoiding talking to him because of that. [00:13:31]</p> Yep, (pause).</p> (Pause), (sigh), (pause), fantasy's mostly involve, (pause), this is so embarrassing. (Pause), we're working on a project together where I'm seen as an equal and having that lead to a sexual relationship. [00:14:40]</p> Yep, largely because of the dearth of women or—</p> Generational rooming in my field, yeah.</p> Maybe, I don't know. There might be a weird gender component to it or it might just be you have a net effect of leaky pipeline and lack of representation. I'm not sure actually, (pause).</p> Yep, (pause).</p> (Pause), I'm drawing a blank.</p> Not that I'm willing to say.</p> I can't think of anything more to say.</p> Okay.</p> (Chuckles), okay.</p> (Clears throat).</p> They're all equally (ph) smart.</p> (Pause), no just generally really, really smart.</p> Of course that can also be said about everyone I've dated, also (pause).</p> (Pause), people who aren't at least as smart as I am are boring to talk to and spend time with, (chuckles), a little arrogant but (pause). [00:19:25]</p> (Pause), (sigh), (pause), no, (pause).</p> I mean if I tried I could force the similarity or comparison, but—</p> I mean—</p> No. I mean—</p> No, (pause). I mean when I think—if I had to just pick a handful of just personality characteristics that describe my dad, I would describe him as, (pause), uncompromising and (pause), thoughtless, and cold, which is not—</p> It may be the uncompromising part would apply, (pause), but not the thoughtless or the cold.</p> Or harsh, (pause).</p> (Pause), mostly on sex, maybe a little bit on the relationship and intimacy. (Pause), not so much on scandal, or consequences, or other people finding out, or anything along those lines. [00:21:42]</p> Yep.</p> Well I mean with one of them in particular, the one who attends my church, his wife is, (pause), bizarrely possessive and territorial around him or around, (pause), all of the women between the ages of about 25 and 50, at our church. I don't know what's going on between them or with their marriage, but yeah. (Pause). [00:22:49]</p> Yeah, (pause).</p> Right. (Pause), about a year and a half ago I had this project for a class I was taking that was—and he really heard, and he—in his field of expertise, like the sub-field he'd spent the last ten years working on.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, so we just met for coffee after church one Sunday, for him to go over my notes</p> And like go through a paper that I didn't understand would mean, and I mean it was—I mean fantasies aside, it was completely on the up and up. But—</p> She showed up to pick him up towards the end of our scheduled time and she was just really—</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, she was weird about the whole thing.</p> I was just, yeah.</p> Yep. I'll endeavor to be on time. It's in my outlook calendar that I have to be leaving by 4:10, and—</p> People just don't respect that. </p> Good night.</p>",2
1000013372.txt,"Fine and you?</p> Short week at work.</p> Yeah. And I saw my mom this weekend, and everything was okay except when we went to the airport she was sitting with me alone and she told me that she... she said that after I got married, you know I told you that my Dad stopped speaking to my Mom when she got married, which is like four months after my wedding, she told me that she felt like the life had been sucked out of her and that she told her husband that she's sick but she thinks - remember I told you she was sick? - But she said it's just that she is completely depressed. Like when he's not around she can't even get out of bed. But she was just saying that to the rest of us that, you know, she's just really sick and she's just really tired. Now I know she had mono so I don't believe that she wasn't sick. So she said she's going to increase her dosage of anti-depressant and once I left she felt like, you know, I felt really bad.</p> Yeah, I felt bad that she was feeling so bad. So I wrote her letter today. I think it would just be better not calling her. And then she feels that when I'm upset or unhappy, she's like, I don't know if we made a mistake, I don't know if we rushed into this. But she's like, I hate when you're unhappy, and I said I think a lot of this stuff is temporary. I'm not as unhappy as I was before.</p> Yeah. But I can relate. I mean when I hear that she's unhappy I feel bad. Like when I hear that she and Harold aren't getting along I feel like she's got so many good qualities why should anybody treat her bad? Though he's not treating her bad. It's like if they get in an argument or if she feels like she's not getting enough attention because he has three children, one who doesn't like my mom at all. Yeah, she was really rude to my mom. So then I can understand where she's coming from. I wrote her a letter I hope she feels better.</p> Yeah, I just haven't heard her act that way since when she was really depressed before and I thought that, you know, her work is going well, she's married and she has this house, and I thought that feeling settled would make her feel better. I hope she gets better and increasing her anti-depressant helps. And Tony couldn't go with me this weekend, so...</p> Yeah, but our tenant was moving out so he stayed to change the locks. But over the weekend when I called him he said that he was waiting for the lawyer and he didn't know if he was going to change the locks, and I felt king of upset. Like did he just make it up so he didn't have to go? If he didn't want to go he could have just told me. And then last night when I got home the front door was open. There are two doors, you know the main door and then doors into the two apartments and that door was open. And he was asleep so I couldn't tell if he'd changed the locks or not, but I found out this morning that one of the locks was changed; so then I didn't feel so upset.</p> Tony, like you know, our communicating. Like last night I was like, did you change the locks? Did the tenant leave her key? And he just wouldn't answer; he just kept on avoiding the questions. But he did and there are extra keys there so I'm assuming that she dropped them off but I don't know why he's so evasive about answering things in general. Like over the weekend when I asked him on the phone, did you change locks? Are you going to call the locksmith? He's like; I'll take care of it. I don't want to get in an argument or get upset while I was on vacation so I just let it slide.</p> Yeah. But he wasn't short with like, my mom or everybody he talked to. When I talked to his parents last night just to tell then I got in, they said they thought the locks had been changed and I couldn't figure it out because there was like eight keys and the front door had been open. And he had just left the front door open so I went and locked up.</p> Yeah. It feels good; when I leave I always feel better.</p> I don't know. I don't think that I'm that unhappy that every time I come here I cry. It's like I wonder if I am. But I'm a person who's never dealt with depression. I don't know what it entails and how somebody feels.</p> Yeah, a little bit. On Friday there was like a big ordeal with work and I was really angry about... I was on vacation on Friday; I had gone through all the proper procedures. I was letting somebody go and hiring a new person and then on Friday morning when I was on vacation I just happened to call my boss to let her know I was going to do it and she said you can't. And I had to call three people and make the change and it made me look bad because I'm already young and then I made a decision and then it just screwed up everything for everybody. So I talked to Tony and I was just venting about how upset I was. He said, I don't think you should tell them that. And I said, I won't but I just need to get it off my chest so tonight when I have my meeting I was calm and could express what I was thinking about my concerns were.</p> Yeah, I think the work thing has been really on my mind. I see what you're saying. I think I'm a little torn. I don't think I need to have more clients, but like, one, I don't get paid more if I have more clients which is something. And then I just remember when I first got the job, maybe because I was more interested in the job that I was working better. I mean now it's just like, you know, when the phone rings I'm just dreading what it's going to be on the other line when people call me and just listening because I really have no idea how I'm supposed to handle it. A lot of the phone calls are really unnecessary though in the beginning everything was super serious and I had to deal with it right away. [10:59]</p> Yeah. I mean we can go back to the things I was talking about earlier about the crying and if I really am upset. I tend to block things out in general.</p> How I'm doing with the feelings that I might be more upset than I realize?</p> When my sister passed away my parents were getting divorced and I just kind of threw myself into my activities and I didn't think about it. Maybe that's what I'm trying to do now, you know, just keep busy so that I don't have to think about all these issues that I have been thinking about because I have more time. More time [inaudible at 12:38], more time at home.</p> But you know when we talked last week it just made me realize that I don't think that it... it was good for me at the time, but I don't think it's the healthiest approach to just ignore things you know. I actually ignored what was going on at my house because, like I said, the lights were always off, it was dark, either somebody was crying or they were fighting and it was better just not to be there and not to think about it. And then my parents were divorced and I didn't have to be there through all of it. But I don't think that I still deal with all these things now instead of... I don't know if I could have dealt with them then.</p> Definitely. When I leave here I don't think about anything for the next couple of days, and then - well, I fill out my questionnaire but I don't think about it - and then it starts creeping back in my head, you know, whatever we talk about in our sessions. [13:54]</p> Because we had been in their car. It was me, my mom, Harold, my grandfather, my aunt. And my mom, I love her to death, but she, I think partly because she's lonely and partly because she's really smart, she has a tendency to go on and on about everything. Like if my cousin said, my mom asked her how she got so skinny and she said I do a workout video every night. My mom said, which ones and she named them, and she said, well do you use this one? And she said, no. And then my mom said, my video has a minute thing that you can see how long the minutes that you've been doing the exercise. And then my cousin said, no mine doesn't have that. And then my mom goes on about... I don't think she means it, but it just comes across like the one she has is better. She tends to do that. If somebody says something she'll be like, well why don't you do this? And that means that the person is doing something wrong, but like a whole day of that it's just too much. And most of us realize that she's not doing it that way but still I guess my patience is not what it used to be because I'm just like, okay we get it. And so I told her that yesterday before she was telling me what was bothering her. I know she and Tony get into... he doesn't argue with her but he gets really frustrated with her. And sometimes her family does too but they don't say anything to her I think partly because of everything she's been through and partly because she's family. And Harold has a way of... he does this time-out thing and they both laugh because he puts her on a time-out, like okay I get your point. But like he kept putting us on a time-out because when we kept bickering back and forth.</p> Yeah, he'd be like, time out for you guys, you know. It's just like a nice friendly way to get his point across. But I kept finding myself snapping at her. I don't know, I don't remember where I was going with this. Anyway, so I was really short with her and I explained to her why it was bothering me because she doesn't recollect and she forgets the story she tells so every story I'd hear like four times. Especially when I'm with her then I hear them like, a lot. When I'm not with her, at least on the phone she can, every time we talk on the phone she'll tell me a couple of the same stories or it'll pop in her head and she'll just have to say it or she interrupts incessantly because she wants to say... I think she just wants to share that she knows what you're talking about. And I used to do this a lot until it was pointed out to me. Like you get so excited about when someone's talking to you, you just interrupt and go in. So like if I tell my mom a story it's like four times I have to be, if you want to hear my story you cannot interrupt and give me advice because you didn't hear the whole story so your advice doesn't make any sense.</p> Yeah. I felt bad telling her the whole lecture thing but I had examples to explain that I knew she wasn't doing it on purpose but how it comes across. Like to my cousin who is 18, that whole workout thing just came across so, not how my mom meant it. I think that my mom just meant to say, oh I do a workout video too and it's really handy to have a minute thing on the video because you can see how long you're working out. But she's so afraid I think that people are not getting her point that he just repeats herself. I was getting a little short-tempered and felt bad. I'm thinking maybe my patience isn't what it used to be, and then I'm thinking because Tony's family is so critical I'm beginning to get critical, neither of which I want.</p> Yeah, I'm always a little bit short with my mom only because I know that I can be short and she's not going to be upset with me or she's not going to fight with me which I don't think is nice. I've done it. I won't yell at her but just a little snappy like; yeah I heard that already let's move on. And yeah, because she knows she doesn't remember everything very well she doesn't mind if you tell her. She would rather have me tell her than... like Tony will never tell her and then he'll hear the story eight times. And then he'll get really frustrated with her and then he won't want to talk to her at all. [19:20]</p> I think I've just been thinking about how I've changed and I've been thinking if I'm happy with who I am. Like, if I - because I'm not generally like that - am I a snappy person and short-tempered all he time and I'm just not realizing it?</p> Yeah, because especially when she came to visit and Tony was around I was really mean to her. I think it was... I know it was just because I knew Tony was aggravated with her and so trying to sense what would aggravate Tony I was just being meaner to her. Like not really mean but just like, being short with her. And then I apologized to her and I made a conscious effort not to do that. I mean this visit was just like our usual; we're like sisters, and this was just our viewpoint and then we'll just laugh and it won't be anything. Nobody's feelings will be hurt, you know. But when she came to visit [inaudible at 20:44]. And I also talked to Tony. I felt the fist few times when we were living together and people came to visit, I would be super sensitive to how he was behaving and if he was happy and I'd consistently be asking him, are you okay? Is everything bla, bla, bla. And he told me once, he said, you assume that things are not okay and it's hard to have somebody ask you like ten times if everything's okay because they just get aggravated that you keep asking. And after that, when people come to visit I've noticed that since I stopped being so sensitive the visits are fine. That he's not actually doing anything or being crabby or uncomfortable with something. So that was a good insight, and I thought that I was just doing it to make sure that everything was okay, but when he explained to me what it was, that I would probably be upset if I was Tony, but I probably wouldn't be but, like if somebody was, are you okay, assuming that something was not okay when everything was fine.</p> Yeah. But then maybe I'm just... maybe I am short-tempered. She didn't say that but...</p> I don't know how it affects the other people in my life. I'm trying to pay more attention about how Tony and I interact. He's just been difficult to reach lately, or not lately, but in the last couple of months. If he's in the mood we have like a great day and a lot of communication, and if he's not it's like trying to pry something off of somebody. I can't get anything.</p> With my mom it's fine. I don't hesitate to say anything. The only time I hesitated was after she told me how depressed she was then I felt really bad that I had said those things to her about her behavior. And she takes them very well. I'm super sensitive to criticism and I probably wouldn't. She said, okay and listened to it and we changed the subject, no hard feelings. Like if I'm in the middle of a story I'll say, can I finish this story already? And we'll kind of joke about it and she'll say, yeah you're right. [23:10]</p> Sometimes. I don't know, I think it depends on the day. Like today with the e-mail, like, getting back right away and saying, you know, I was so afraid he was just going to say, I don't want to go to New Zealand. Like I said, I totally understand money wise we couldn't afford it but one, it's a chance of a lifetime and my dad's offered to pay accommodation for two or whatever. He said, I don't feel comfortable taking money from your father. Why don't we try this and we'll try the Price Line thing and see what can work? When we were dating I told him how important traveling was for me and I've found since we've been together, because he travels so much at work that traveling is really lost it's appeal to him. So I think this New Zealand trip is like him trying to see how we can fit it in as a compromise. He hasn't really said that he doesn't want to go but I know that he doesn't love traveling. But we booked that honeymoon, we went to Europe and it was like pulling teeth to get him to say we could go, and then even until the last minute there were things going at work. It was like, I don't know if I can go. And I said, well if you can't go I'm taking somebody else so, my girlfriend. And then he went and he really enjoyed himself.</p> I think it just shows that he's not... he always tries to act so grown up and he's not. I think he tries to act like his dad, and his dad would never do that. His dad thinks out everything about everything. My mom was telling a story about how when Tony and I were dating she had met Tony and she really wanted to meet Tony's parents. And her sister-in-law, my aunt, was visiting her from Ft. Lauderdale. So they made up this story about how they were going to go to the Catskills and said it to Tony. So Tony said, oh my parents are right there and they'd love to see you. So they went there and my mom, you know, she's really book smart but not so street smart. So they were talking and they went the wrong way for about an hour and a half. They were going to Montreal instead of [inaudible at 30:08]. And Tony called and they finally got there and they were just giggling and telling their story. And she was saying that Tony's dad is so analytical, like he would have thought that whole story out. Like first of all why did you change at that gas station and then he would think, you know... they had trouble at the border and his question would be why was your aunt driving and not you? Like why hadn't you guys prepared. Not critical, but he thinks about everything. He planned our engagement party and the napkins had to match the carpet on the floor. I don't know, he just does. And Tony isn't like that, and I think he likes to think that he is. Or maybe he thinks he should be that way.</p> Yeah, now I can't stop imagining [inaudible at 32:37]. Maybe Tony needs counseling. You know, he doesn't have... he works. A lot of his friends have left the company or don't live in Chicago. He doesn't have a lot of good friends here. He likes to spend time alone but when I'm not at work I'm always around. I try to give him a break by doing things with my friends after work because I know by now that he's not going to join me. I'll just tell him where I'll be and go out. But it must be hard for him too. And then to have that pressure, you know, he puts pressure on himself like the house and money. [33:20]</p> I save all my receipts; I'm like let's make a spreadsheet of where the money's going. I didn't even know how much the mortgage was until he told me. Then I don't know what the other expenses are. I'm like, can I at least have your credit card statement so we can see where the money is going there. I don't know how much money he spends a week. I mean he's not that aggressive about knowing where my money goes either. He knows that I put all the utilities on my credit card bill and I have a Visa card that we share that I try to put on shared expenses and just leave my personal stuff on my credit, but then it's like, I don't hide anything but now it's just easier because then I get to take care of my own stuff. And he told me he just wanted to wait a little bit. I don't know what he's waiting for. Maybe he's scared that I'll spend all the money in there, but I doubt it. And that's what happens, I just guess what he's thinking and I could be so far off.</p> It doesn't all come back. Like, I'll just not think about anything we talked about in the session, like when I go home. And maybe for the next day I won't think about it, you know, I'll just feel good. And then I'll start thinking about the things we said, and start reflecting on what we talked about or what I said and what I think about what I said. You know, do a summary of dialogue and try and apply it to my life. Maybe if I was more... maybe I used to be, when we first started dating, more open and less timid. And that worked better. And now I'm becoming more submissive and that's why it's easy for him to get away with a lot of the stuff, because I'm not... I really think working for him had a huge part of it. Before, I was like; I loved being with Tony because he just made me feel like I was on top of the world. And then I started working with him and he started speaking to me more curtly and just being harder on me. Like I said that's why I had to point that out. And then our relationship just ended up that way. I can't take that back. I mean, there's a lot of good things; now I understand what he does. He can talk about work and it makes sense. Before I didn't even know [inaudible at 37:33] And I told him that, it's just he doesn't really see it.</p> Good.</p> You know, when I wrote her that letter I think that I have relied on her pretty heavily during everything. And I know her reaction is always like, oh yeah, you know, assumes that things are just like they are with my father. But I felt like I've been relying on her so heavily that maybe I haven't given her a chance to rely on me. If she's been feeling this way for a year I think that maybe I should have known. No, I was just hoping that she was better. I think that's more disappointing than anything. I mean, at least if she had used anything else besides like... I mean she pretty much said she felt like she was dead. She felt like the life was sucked out of her, she felt like her eyes didn't have any life in them. She said she goes to work in a way that she would never even gone to check her mail outside. You know, just so whatever, and I feel bad for her. [39:38]</p> I wrote in the letter, like she's been through so much that I was hoping that it would finally be time for her not to go through anything. She said that she was really disappointed that my dad doesn't speak to her but I'm tired of him making her unhappy when they're not together anymore. So how he can still have that control over her, you know, they haven't spoken in a year. It's just, I feel bad. I think maybe I should have noticed or even if I did notice I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I know it will be her, herself that will make herself better.</p> Yeah. It's just like she always told me that she could imagine her life without me, that I couldn't imagine my life without her, and just that all the experiences that we're going to share in the future, how am I going to do those without her. And I said, maybe if we weren't so far away these things wouldn't come up. She got better when I was around. Maybe it's a little bit of emptiness, like even when I was at college I was still close, and she has to deal with a lot of those things now.</p> I didn't want to move to Chicago you know. I got into grad school there and my mom had just built her house and it would have just saved a lot of money for me to finally move with her. She'd been in her apartment since she got divorced. And the program was good. All the programs I got into were better than the one here. Tony's like, I can't be in a long-term relationship, or a long-distance relationship, and I probably wouldn't have either. And by then the [inaudible at 41:55] thing had already happened by the time I heard from my grad schools so. Being in Chicago is exciting but it's still only Chicago. It's hard to think that I will start a family and my mom will be so far. I joked with her and Harold this weekend that when my house is finished my mom will have to retire and spend a month with me and when I have kids my mom will have to come and spend some time with me. [43:19]</p> I guess a little bit of me is scared that when the house is one and I'm unpacked... I guess now the house is such an excuse but what if all these excuses... I'm so counting on that to make me feel at least a little bit more settled in Chicago, give me some peace of mind. I went home yesterday and I'm like, oh, I hate this place.</p> It's messy and I'm not super clean, but I'm not messy and it just aggravates me that even if I wanted to clean there's nowhere to put anything. And I want to throw stuff out but I didn't get to any of my boxes to throw anything out. And it's like on top of everything I've got upstairs the wardrobe just keeps getting smaller. There's just like too much stuff; I don't even know what to do with it. I got an exercise machine and I started working out last night. Maybe I'll get into some of those clothes I haven't been getting into. 46:17]</p> I saw my cousins and they're like size twos. I was like, mom was I ever a size two? It's like you were never thin. I was never thin? She said that I just went from like a nothing to... I was like, that wasn't very nice. But I was never... I always had a stomach.</p> I hope so. This job doesn't help. Having to worry about everybody else and being totally responsible for that stuff. It's not like I want a job where I don't have to be responsible but like, it's just too much pressure for me to be that responsible for people's lives.</p> Yeah, I was telling my boss that I felt guilty about cases and she was like, you have to knock those thoughts out of your head. And I said, it's easier for you. You've been doing this for like 50 years. You ran the company. It's not that easy for me to be like, well, okay I know you have no money and I have to charge you an arm and a leg for everything and, you know, it's just hard. Sometimes [inaudible at 49:06]</p> You know, when I told you in the beginning that I got frustrated that I'm like this because it's not me. When I look back at who I was in high school and college, you know, my friend told me, he's like, I thought that you would be 25, businesswoman, not even thinking about getting married. And not so much that it was the marriage part, but he was right. Like I was always extremely independent and extremely outspoken and I'm nothing really right now. And I think that's really bothering me.</p> Yeah. I don't know why I keep letting Tony treat me that way, you know.</p> [inaudible at 50:11] All right. Thank you.

1004528619.txt,"Hi. First things first, you know I need some recommendations for prescribers [overlapping voices]</p> . . . what I've done here, I still don't [overlapping voices]</p> Okay.</p> And you'll [overlapping voices]</p> Okay, thanks.</p> I appreciate it.</p> No.</p> Thanks.</p> (Big sigh) Well I don't know whether to start with work stuff that I've been tripping over myself over or stuff my parents and my sister or my interview yesterday or I don't even know, so (both chuckling). I don't remember what we talked about last Thursday, so I'm not sure if there is a starting to be picked up.</p> Well so I had this hour, luncheon hour, a day-long interview yesterday, [overlapping voices]</p> . . . for, again, five-hour long slots [overlapping voices]</p> . . . and I thought they all went horribly badly, and I felt like I failed and did not really answer the technical questions well, and did not really present myself as someone who knows this material. There were several times when someone asked me a question and I was like ""I know I should know that but I'm blanking on the answer right now"". I just, I don't know (sounding upset). But I described the whole interview in detail to Dave afterwards and it took me an hour to go through the whole [overlapping voices]</p> . . . postmortem. And he was like ""that actually sounds like a pretty good interview"". I was like ""well, okay"". So clearly, I don't know if this is a difference between our fields or if this is just a case of I tend to underrate myself or, uh, yeah, I don't know, but. [00:03:00]</p> I know, um, so the hiring manager, who did not do any of my interviews, [overlapping voices]</p> . . . came to talk to me after I was done with all five interviews.</p> And you know I asked, kind of casually, partway through the conversation, well like when he asked me how I thought it went and I said, ""Oh, I think it went pretty well. Have any of your people gotten back to you yet?""</p> And he was like ""I haven't had a chance to talk to any of them, except Joel, but he thought that interview went fairly well."" So like and that's [overlapping voices]</p> . . . the one that I thought I'd failed the most miserably on, so.</p> Yeah, yeah [overlapping voices]</p> . . . or maybe he was just like throwing up a smokescreen, didn't want to give away the results yet until they have a chance to talk to HR, I don't know, yeah (ph), so there's that. And I keep dwelling over questions that I answered wrong. I actually spent quite some time last night looking up in my textbooks the answers to some of the questions that I didn't know instantly, which Dave told me was a giant waste of time. [00:04:11]</p> Well I mean if I ever get asked those exact same questions it could be extremely helpful (both chuckling).</p> (Pause) Probably not, (long pause), I mean that's certainly why I told myself I was looking them up, instead of doing something more useful or you know more fun. But you know if I'm honest with myself, it was mostly a way to say, you idiot, this answer is totally obvious in hindsight, why didn't you know this? [00:05:02]</p> M-hmm.</p> It's certainly the sort of thing I do a lot [overlapping voices]</p> . . . of the time.</p> (Pause) I don't know. [Silence from [00:05:56] to 00:06:20]</p> (Long pause) I was talking to Dave last night over dinner and he mentioned that you know he reads this blog that's written by a lawyer, and this lawyer went back to his alma mater and asked for employment statistics. And it turns out that you know in that state there were like five open jobs for every hundred graduates this law school was graduating.</p> And you know he was saying ""you know I wonder if your sister"" — my sister is in her last year of school, is graduating in May, so he said, ""I wonder if your sister knows about this?"" And I was like ""if she didn't before, I'm sure she's figured it out by now since she's job hunting"". [00:07:08]</p> It just led to us talking about my sister, um, and Dave asked me if my sister you know had the same kind of crazy expectations put on her, as a kid, as I did. And I was like, ""Well I was expected to be surgeon general and my sister was expected to be a CEO of a Fortune 500 Company, so you know not the same but (other chuckling) the same level of crazy maybe (chuckling).""</p> So we were talking about that and, (pause) there was this huge thing at Christmas. I don't know if I told you about Christmas and my youngest sister calling and telling us all we were selfish bitches, and drama over moving her new TV into her new apartment, and my sisters getting into a fistfight over some makeup in the parking lot of my other sister's apartment building?</p> That was a lot of crazy (chuckling).</p> So (pause) the, what night was that? I think it was Christmas night or maybe it was Boxing Day, I can't remember, but it was the night, it was Christmas night and my younger sister was in Missouri; she was working a 12 to midnight shift that night and the rest of the family was found at my parent's house having Christmas dinner, and there was massive drama. It would probably take too long to describe all of it.</p> But it completely distracted, the dinnertime and post dinnertime drama, and then Dave fleeing and me fleeing and needing to calm each other down, completely distracted from some earlier drama that day, which Dave was not aware of until we talked about it last night, in which while my mom and my sister and I were preparing Christmas dinner and Dave and my dad and my sister Heidi like were all in the living room playing with their various computers and being antisocial, as they all have a tendency to do. [00:09:01]</p> My dad is just antisocial, Jeremy and Dave are both very introverted. So they were all off in their own little world and my mom started yelling at my sister about how, ""You know before you married Jeremy you were so ambitious and you wanted to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 Company. And Jeremy has killed all of your ambitions and you're going to get a crappy job and you're going to be a professional failure because you're not ambitious anymore. And I wish you could see what Jeremy is doing to you.""</p> And my sister's response, um, of course, my mom's frothing and anger was much more coherent than that; that's the executive summary.</p> And the executive summary of my sister's response is, ""You know when I was little you and Dad made it sound like if you weren't earning seven figures you were practically in the poorhouse and so, of course, I wanted to be a CEO, so it's the only job you can have where you easily earn seven figures. And now that I'm living on my husband's income, and you know spending half our money on school tuition, I realize you actually can live on like (other chuckling) 60 or 70 thousand dollars a year and it's not that bad."" [00:10:04]</p> ""And I want to have a family, and I was a secretary for a CEO at a large Fortune-500-size company and being the CEO is a really shitty job, it's really stressful and my boss never saw their family, and I want something different for my life."" And like my mom just kept saying, ""You know Jeremy has ruined you; he's made you less smart, he's made you less ambitious, he has no ambitions himself. What's wrong with you?""</p> . . . until I told him about it last night. I was like ""you were right there"".</p> He was right in the living room.</p> Like the layout of my parent's house, there's a kitchen breakfast nook that opens up into the family room.</p> My parents are very much a fan of like open-layout houses. I know they're not a fan of doors of walls much, to my misfortune as a teenager (slight chuckle). So like Dave was like 15 feet away, like but he was off in his own world. And I guess it just goes to show how crazy my family is, that he could just ignore someone, two people screaming and crying (whispering) 15 feet away from you, good God.</p> But, yeah, so remembering that and talking about it was upsetting. And then we got home from dinner and opened the mail, and my parents had sent me a birthday card a week and a half late, of course, even though they throw a hissy fit I acknowledge their birthdays late or even you know after 7:00 p.m., he thinks, ""My God, what kind of monster are you?"" [00:12:08]</p> ""You know they're retired, their house is paid for, they don't have any expenses""; ""they're getting free money from Social Security"" and ""they are so stingy"" and ""how could they"", and it was just this whole rant about how. I was like my grandmother worked for a phone company, my grandfather was in the military, until he retired, and then he drove a fucking bus, it's not like they were rolling in dough when they were working, and once they retired were on a fixed income.</p> And I didn't understand any of this when I was in high school but yet, on hindsight, I'm like Social Security (whispering) doesn't give you that much. And even if your mortgage is paid for there's still you know doctor's bills and co-pays for prescriptions and food, and it's just like here's her son talking hypocritical, that they bitched about how little my grandparents sent to them and they give me the same amount when they're both still working and between them usually earning like 300 thousand dollars a year, which is far more than Social Security, okay. [00:14:03]</p> And it's not even that the amount of the check matters to me, but [overlapping voices]</p> Yeah. And it's not even that I want them to give me a bigger gift, but I want to (pause), I know this was impossible, but what I really want is for them to never have maligned my grandparents for being stingy, which you know obviously is impossible because time doesn't work that way, but [overlapping voices]</p> . . . it just makes me feel like [overlapping voices]</p> Yeah (both chuckling). (Pause) So, yeah, there's that (whispering) [stuff about your] (ph) parents. And when there's work stuff from my advisor, which is just (sighing) for the last week I've been stuck on this one task, which is I have this offer Q-3-D (ph), and I have three different designs in Q-3-D of the three different circuits. [00:15:00]</p> . . . which would take you know 15 minutes at most. [00:16:10]</p> But I keep sitting there, because I've already calculated the numbers and I have them written down in my notes, so it's just a matter of opening the file and erasing a typo, [overlapping voices]</p> . . . like three numbers per file. And I haven't done it yet because it just burns me that there's no way to do this automatically. And it's like I can't count the number of times I've sat down an looked at the computer and opened the software and just couldn't bring myself to open the materials library editor and just do it and get it done with and move on with my life. And it has been a week (chuckling) stuck with this 15-minute task and I'm just, I don't know how to just — I don't know, I'm angry and frustrated with myself. Because when I'm saying it out loud it sounds really stupid, but like (pause) I feel really stupid saying this here but (sighing) [overlapping voices] [00:17:01]</p> . . . I suppose if I can't tell my shrink I can't really help that, [overlapping voices]</p> . . . right, and then I remember [well us] (ph) saying you can't tell people how dumb I am.</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm. [Silence from [00:17:57] to 00:18:10]</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> Right.</p> Yeah.</p> [Silence from [00:19:16] to 00:19:23] I don't know. I think (pause), despite the evidence of you know me being reasonably smart and able to read instructions and search the instruction manuals and having spent four hours looking for a way to automate this, [overlapping voices]</p> . . . there is still a part of me that thinks of the notion that it doesn't make sense for their not to be a way to automate this. So clearly there is, I just haven't found it yet because I'm too stupid to figure it out. Like there's got to be a magic knob somewhere or you know put this file in the search where you know it will get repeated (ph); there's got to be something but (sighing). And it's demoralizing that I can't figure out how to automate it [overlapping voices] [00:20:07]</p> . . . (pause) because it should be obvious. And because it should be obvious and I haven't figured it out, clearly the problem is with me and not with the software. Because it should be obvious, right, which means it is obvious; I just can't see it because I'm dumb.</p> And I realize, in reality that logic was torturous but [overlapping voices]</p> Right.</p> And so there's this (sighing), almost religious in its intensity, divide between two different counts the computer needs (ph). There's the camp who thinks you know the right way to do something is just the way that (pause) gets it done in a sustainable way; so you know you write a script that is comprehensible, in case someone else needs to pick up your work, and you use tools that are commonly used that everyone knows how to use. And then there's the camp of you know 'fucking weenie ninjas' I call them, who want to use the most obscure tools possible; and you know why write a script that takes ten lines and is comprehensible to other people, when you can write a line of god-awful clock (ph) code that no one is ever going to be able to figure out, not even yourself ten minutes after you write it. [00:23:02]</p> And (sighing) I actually got into this argument with one of interviewers yesterday, which is why it's on the top of my head. He asked me what programming languages I knew and I said, ""Python, maybe a little bit of Pearl."" And he was like, ""Well what about SED (ph) and AUC (ph), they're so powerful?"" And I was like [overlapping voices]</p> SED.</p> And I was like, ""They might be powerful but you know one out of a thousand people have even heard of them, much less knows how to use the damn thing (both chuckling). And I actually got into this argument with him, but I realized that this thing I'm trying to do with my Q-3-D, I am trying to find the clever, elegant solution, instead of just the solution that gets it done and allows me to move on. And that's frustrating because I don't like to think of myself as you know those fucking weenies who really you know can't just live in the real world with the rest of us.</p> Weenie ninjas.</p> Like they like to think of themselves as ninjas but they're really not.</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> Yeah.</p> Right, maybe.</p> Right. [Silence from [00:25:32] to 00:26:25]</p> M-hmm.</p> (Long pause) That's a good question, I don't know. [Silence from [00:26:52] to 00:27:05] So I even think of my history as broken up into personal eras. There is the era of living in Indiana; so there is the era of Alabama; and there is middle school; and then there was the juggling, both Debate and Science Olympiad era; and then there is senior year, which was just Science Olympiad; and then there is college, and Japan and post Japan. And for most of them, if I try to think about you know what was the — what were some of the defining factors of each of those periods, there was always something I was angry at.</p> (Long pause) And I know I've certainly read this in a bunch of books. I read lots of books. I read a ton of them when I was a kid. [00:28:02]</p> And I didn't have very many friends and I would like blast through you know 10 or 15 library books a week. I read [overlapping voices]</p> . . . really fast.</p> When I was in middle school and high school I just had nothing else to do with my time. That rate has dropped quite a bit since college and working and actually having friends and a life [inaudible at 00:28:23]</p> But in a lot of (pause) books, especially the kind of books I read, there's this whole notion that you know anger drives the hero forward. Like anger at some great injustice causes him to go on the hero's journey and you know become the hero. And you know my dad also now was a very angry (breathless chuckle) person, unsurprisingly, and you know he would explicitly say that anger was what got him out of the refugee camps and into his career. [00:28:59]</p> M-hmm. [Silence from [00:30:06] to 00:30:16]</p> When he was first in the US, before he became a citizen he had this work visa of some type but I can't remember what kind it was, but he had a supervisor who was a total jerk to him. You know my dad was a resident and doctors were assholes to residents by and large.</p> And my dad got fed up and like told his boss off and said, ""I'm quitting because you're an asshole and I'm going to find someone else to do my residency with."" And the guy was like, ""You can't do that. We hold your work visa."" [00:30:58]</p> . . . he'll talk about how he you know got so angry he started shouting, and that's what changed people's minds because they saw his fiery passion. That's not something to be proud of.</p> M-hmm.</p> That's what I think (whispering).</p> Yeah. (Pause) You know he hasn't talk to his brother for like 12 years and [overlapping voices]</p> . . . he cut off both his sisters (long pause). I hardly ever talk to him even and he's just — and my youngest sister doesn't talk to him, unless she wants money from him.</p> And I don't blame her. He's done — he's been far more horrible to her than he has to me or our middle sister. He routinely tells her he wishes they'd had an abortion instead of having her. [00:33:11]</p> Yeah. It's pretty — that's really horrible.</p> I was about to say, the thing that kills me is that people, no one has called him on it and told him that's horrible, but I haven't called him on it either.</p> And I don't know why, other than (pause), well I do know why. If I said you know, ""Dad that's really horrible. I can't believe you said that. That's you know absolutely like unacceptable."" He would scream and yell about how I had no respect for him. [00:34:01]</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> Maybe. [Silence from [00:35:35] to 00:35:47] Yeah, I don't (long pause), I'm not sure how much of my feelings right now are reaction about the way they've treated me personally and how much is that I actually find their value systems morally repulsive, um, [that it's false] (ph), but I'm not sure in what proportion. [Silence from [00:36:10] to 00:36:36]</p> So, (long pause) this whole attitude my parents have of ""wealth is the only thing that matters, it's the only indicator of success that matters and, furthermore, politically we don't care what else a candidate might say or do, we only care about what's going to lower our taxes and you know we want all of these benefits"".</p> I was like, ""Then what the fuck, you are voting against your self-interest in a really blatantly obvious way here and you're just — and because that person was in favor of lower taxes.""</p> That's just un-fucking believable and just (sighing), I don't know, I find it completely and totally morally bankrupt. And, especially the way you know they don't care whether my sisters and I are happy, they only care whether we're successful, and by successful they mean rich. [00:39:06]</p> . . . pursues people of having rich kids by pushing us to earn it ourselves instead of marrying us off to rich partners. But like the end goal of you know [overlapping voices]</p> . . . having lots of money is the same. And how (pausing and sighing), yeah, just (long pause) [overlapping voices] [00:40:11]</p> No (ph).</p> Yeah. (Pause) I told you about this fit of rage I had at one point in high school, where I took away all my trophies and medals and threw them in a box in the basement?</p> There was another incident, where you know, for the one and only time, I actually brought home a report card that was all A+s and yet there was no room for my parents to say ""straight As, where are the pluses?"" because they actually were (both chuckling) all A+s. [00:41:00]</p> And they were like ""we didn't expect anything less"" and I was just furious and I tore it up into little pieces and said — I don't remember what I said but I remember tearing it up into little pieces and just like running to my room and slamming the door and flinging myself on the bed and sobbing uncontrollably for quite a while. I was just (sighing — long pause) [overlapping voices]</p> (Huffing sigh) Unloved [silence from [00:41:36] to 00:41:47] and angry. I felt like there is this implicit contract that if I gave them what they wanted they would show me affection, and they didn't and that was you now they reneged on the contract, and that was not okay. [00:42:04]</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> They told me they were disappointed that I only graduated seventh in my class out of 600, instead of valedictorian. [Silence from [00:42:36] to 00:42:50] I felt awful about that (pause) for years afterwards, before I finally realized that it truly doesn't matter. [00:43:00]</p> (Long pause) I think so (questioningly) but I'm not sure. If there was a time when I felt sure that my parents loved me, I'm not remembering it right now, but that doesn't mean that it (sighing) didn't [overlapping voices]</p> . . . happen.</p> Yeah (ph).</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> Okay.</p>",1
1004687724.txt,"So, a lot of—basically what we talked about on Monday is even less conceptually creative (ph) in my mind than it was then, and so it's kind of fuzzy—gotten a little more fuzzy, so I just, like, feel bad just to, you know, quit (ph).

So, when I ask you a question that has to do with psychology, you do that, you pause, and you really frame—think about how you're going to frame your answer very carefully. Which, to me, implies that it would not be beneficial for me to just go away and read a whole lot about psychology. But I don't know.</p> Because I understand that conceptually much better than I can see it between us. I mean, I can see aspects of it, but it's hard for me to kind of (inaudible at 07:59).</p> Experiential?</p> I tend to not to give my writing to people until it's in its close-to-polished form.

But (inaudible at 10:18).</p> I definitely understand that. the distinguishing between which dimensions are yours and which dimensions you're attributing to other people. And which dimensions are actually other people's. And kind of growing into a greater understanding of that.</p> Yeah.</p> I got it, I think.</p> Yeah, I recognize that.</p> Yeah. That says that even if you kind of track down, or come to realize the projection that you're creating, it doesn't necessarily make the projection go away. It's still—I mean, then I guess maybe a separate issue.</p> I mean, I find that it doesn't make it go away. (laughs)</p> In a way that makes you feel as though you are that way.</p> I mean, I think I see what you mean.</p> This is similar to or, you know, encompassed—or does it encompass the ways that, like, families will often, you know, assign a role to each member of the family? And then each person will kind of reinforce that role being played?</p> You know, I mean in my mother's family, her younger—her second younger—you know, there were four kids, she was the second oldest—the third was a sister, who was kind of assigned the role of the fat, stupid one in the family, by their mother. And I, you know, I think she spent of her life thinking she was fat and stupid, you know. And it's—she's a counselor. (laughs). I think she's got a good life, but she's still a little (inaudible at 17:34) (laughs).</p> Yeah, it was really important to my grandmother that she have that role.

I always, like, I don't read woman magazines anymore. I haven't for, like, five or six years, because I realize I always feel about myself after putting the magazine down. And, clearly, they're just—that's what they're trying to do. (laughs) Just, like, you would feel like crap. This is stupid.</p> What do you mean by primitive?

I just—there are several opinions voiced that that's the main aspect of it, like, that's really what is going on always. You know, it all goes back to your childhood. I just don't know—I don't know.

Well, when I say ""good at that,"" I mean, I've noticed that you're very careful about that. That's way less complicated than I thought it was going to be. (laughs). Yeah, maybe.

I've never [done this] (ph) before.</p> We're much further along than any therapist or therapeutic relationship that I have ever been in. But it seems like those are, you know, psychotherapy is trying to do something slightly different. But the best thing I can think of, or the thing that it seems like it might mischaracterize it is—tell me if I'm right—it's kind of changing the symptoms, versus changing the underlying dynamics?</p> Which is what I want, but it's also very scary for me because then, you know, who am I going to be at the end of this?

And then I just took the day off.</p> Yeah. It kicked in as of yesterday. They told me I need to get approval in some way. I need to call somebody and I didn't have the energy yesterday to do it.</p> No, because they are still processing it. I only got a one-word e-mail saying, ""Confirmed,"" that they had gotten all of my stuff and had signed me up on the 31st and I haven't gotten any other information about it. [00:01:17]</p> I need to call and harass them anyway, so if you wouldn't mind looking it up later?</p> I need to make sure that they're going to be okay with my thing—you know Dr. [Vaughn] (ph)—and figure out how that works.</p> Yeah. I think I might have the same insurance somewhere, but I'm not sure.</p> What they have in the brochure?</p> I'm sure it's PPO. It's the $1,000 deductible. This month, I'll probably be paying out of pocket, but after that ...</p> August—because of the deductible. And definitely July I'll be paying out of pocket.</p> I would appreciate that.</p> They told me that I don't need authorizations from a PCP but I need to call some number to get some kind of approval. I don't remember exactly what it was.</p> I just don't want to go through a month and then have them be like, ""No, we're not paying this because you didn't call a 1-800 number once,"" (laughs) because they will do that.</p> I don't know. I don't know.</p> Can I think about that?</p> Yeah. I hate insurance. I hated it when I didn't have to actually do everything myself and now I hate it way more. (laughs) But you know they told me that I was insured, so that's good. (laughs) It only took me two months to figure out.</p> Was there other business stuff?</p> There is this weird disconnect between when I don't have responsibilities on my mind, then I don't have responsibilities. When they're not right in front of me I don't have to deal with them, so that may get a shade better. This morning I worked for an hour and a half before coming here, which is good that I can work. That was awesome. I kind of sat down intending to work several times yesterday and then I was like, ""No. This is no good. Don't push."" But it's very weird. I'm working on just getting this bibliography together. The guy doesn't have the bibliography and he didn't write down the page range for any of the articles that he cited, but he's going to have to go back and work that shit out because I'm not looking that up for him. (laughs) And, yeah, I will look up the stuff on the Internet if he wants me to, but he's the one who looked them up in the first place. [00:07:19] I feel like my capacity to obsess is one of the things that makes me good at this. At the same time, I can feel myself over the course of an hour having to fight down this panic about all of the things. I catch myself in mistakes and I'm thinking, ""I should have done this in this draft,"" and, ""I sent him this draft but that had this mistake in it and I have to change it in the draft and he's probably revised it since then."" I get more and more anxious about making mistakes as I go through and work until I just stop, which is usually after about an hour or two, two hours maybe. I just feel myself freaking out. (laughs) [00:08:52] (pause) Thinking I must be such a disappointment. (sighs)</p> Yeah, sort of. Pretty much.</p> Yeah. You know, one of the thing I put in my cover letter as well as the things I say to myself to make myself feel better is I'm pretty detail-oriented. You can give me a job to catch other people's mistakes and I'm okay with that. So when I fail at that, it just gets under my skin. [00:10:33]</p> Well, it looks like you're going to say something. (both laugh) I probably shouldn't, in retrospect, have signed on for this with somebody that I'm not actually friends with but would like to be friends with. It probably wasn't a great idea. But I did. [00:11:39]</p> Yeah. I mean I always am worried that I'm disappointing whomever I'm working for. When it's somebody that I really like and would like to be friends with, somebody that was really extraordinarily kind to me—and that's something that is valuable and rare right now—and somebody that I can see is himself in a pretty anxious state or in a bind. And it's writing. Writing is like your kid. I don't worry so much about asking other people look at my writing. I've kind of trained myself to get over that sensitivity because I think that having other people look at rough work is so important but, particularly around here, everybody's ego is so fragile. This is his baby. [00:13:10] It's got a cleft palate or something. (chuckles) He feels like it's not good enough but he has to give it to me because he has to get it to a point where he can turn it in. He really wants people to read it but he kind of doesn't want anybody to read it because he doesn't feel like it's where he imagined it would be. That's my sense from filling in the gaps from every conversation with every other writer I've ever had. (both laugh) I feel like I should be very, very careful in how I talk with him about it and I haven't been because I've been kind of crazy. Like an addict. Yeah. [00:14:25]</p> Me?</p> (laughs) Sort of. Yeah. (laughs) He gave it to me and was like, ""I have been thinking about asking somebody to proofread this, but I kind of don't want to because I don't want to hear anybody else's opinions about it. I can't deal with that right now."" I said, ""Okay. I won't tell you my opinions."" And he was like, ""But you would have opinions."" I was like, ""Yes. Yes I would.""</p> I was like, ""Yep. Can't do anything about that one."" But then he sends it to me and he clearly he does want me to say nice things about it. (both laugh) And it's really good. I really enjoyed it. It's 300 pages on a topic that I know absolutely nothing about and I completely understand his reasoning, which also never happens in dissertations. [00:15:50]</p> Yeah. Yeah. So it's even more like everything is riding on this. It's really good. It's also really rough. I see why he doesn't want to show it to everybody, but it's comparatively rough. I don't think he realizes that I'm the, people don't pay attention to being good at writing. (both laugh) It's not a prerequisite. Some people are like, ""Is there humor in their dissertation? That is fantastic. I love that."" I don't know. I guess I just feel like I want to be supporting him and I feel like I haven't been in terms of the quality of my work and in terms of (laughs) helping him be okay. It's actually upsetting for me. (pause) [00:17:55] Yeah, I always take my work personally. I always make it personal. That's deliberate. It's not deliberate; it's something that I feel good about. I think work should be personal. I think a full integration into my life is what I want for my work, but this is where it doesn't go so well.</p> Not so much today. I felt crippled in my ability to deal with people or to talk to people. It's like in the aftermath I'm like, ""Oh, this is what was going on with that person."" Normally I would have seen that right then and be able to respond appropriately, but something about both perceiving what people are telling me and saying what I want to say is just garbled when things are really bad for me. I feel like I owe people that, which I think I said before. (pause) [00:20:46]</p> Probably. Just getting out the door I feel like I have to be careful. I'm not coming up with the right words. It's how conversations work. Sometimes it feels like you have something to say and sometimes it feels like you're waiting for me to say something. I feel like the default setting here is that you're waiting for me to say something, but if you seem like you're on the edge of saying something, I wait for it to come out. (laughs) I don't know if everybody does as much as how conversation works, that you pay attention to other people's cues.</p> Yeah, but then I told you about it, so then I'm not worried anymore. (laughs) I mean, really.</p> Yeah, that's about right.</p> Yeah. Yeah. [00:25:52] One, I think that's a good analogy because it's not so much that I'm afraid of taking up emotional space as that I'm afraid of taking up the wrong emotional space.</p> But about three-quarters of it is the wrong emotional space. (both laugh) Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And even when it's somebody else, one point of the conversation is to talk about how I'm feeling, and I feel comfortable talking sometimes. When the other person is clearly trying to be a resource for me then I say, ""Okay, I can let you help me in that way."" I'm intruding on other people's lives or other people's happiness. I feel like a black hole. I really want people to come to me, but I also want to say, ""No. Stay away. You don't want to be here. You don't want to know what this is like."" (voice breaks) (pause) (crying) ... (inaudible at 0:29:15) This is exactly what we were talking about. It feels self-indulgent to me to cry in here and not talk. (laughs) What the fuck? (laughs) (sniffles) (long pause) [00:31:15] I both can't figure it out and I can't stop trying to figure it out, and one or the other I think would be preferable than both. I'm just constantly picking away at it. ""It"" being depression—the whole big thing. I can't leave it alone. I get frustrated that I can't figure it out or that thinking about it doesn't make it better. (pause) ... (inaudible at 0:32:37) I'm watching too much Dr. Who. (both laugh) ... (inaudible at 0:32:46) all the time. That's a good show.</p> I'm just having a hard time thinking or I'm distracted by thoughts that aren't actually sentences so I can't say them. (laughs) Things don't fit together. Sorry.</p> Maybe. Sounds like pre-sentences. I'm not good at discarding them, I think. I like the characters. They do a really good job of characterization and I think it's very good. It's kind of a show about what makes a person which, I think, is all.</p> Yeah. What is it, basically? (laughs) You could say that all of [...] (inaudible at 0:34:38) and all of art is about what makes a person; but that's so broad as to not have that much content. It's fun. It's fun. I like fantasy. Do you know Lev Grossman (ph)? He's a critic and he's a novelist. I think he kind of started out writing as a critic and published two fantasy novels. I read the first one and I hated it so much. I don't hate that many books. Usually if I don't like a book, I appreciate it. This one was like I hated it to the point where I hated Lev Grossman. Like you—I hate you. (both laugh) It was the only thing of his that I ever read. First, the guy whose dissertation I'm editing made a reference to Lev Grossman in the introduction. I put a note in there. I was like, ""I hated that book,"" (both laugh) which I probably shouldn't have done but whatever. [00:36:09] He just published an article that he published in Time. He has a weekly article there. It came up on my Facebook newsfeed and I read it. It was really funny and really clever and there was a link to an article that he'd written about genre fiction. That was just spot on everything that I had been thinking about genre fiction for the last several years and have been trying to relay to other people. I really, really agree with him conceptually, but when he actually writes genre fiction he does all of the things that I think are wrong. (laughs) What is the link there? I think I started talking about this because I started reading fantasy really as escapist literature, literally as escapist. What I like about it is that it transmutes the problems of real life to such an extent that it seems like a distant thing. But then you can solve the problems there and it helps you figure out your own life, if that makes sense. [00:37:53] So as a kid, it was really important to me to be reading a lot of stories about children who were kind of alone or abandoned or on their own and made it through. That was really good and to say, ""No, it's not fair, but yes, you will survive.""</p> Yes.</p> Yeah. Sometimes I think the farther away it apparently gets from the human condition the closer it gets to it, which I like. [I am pathetic. I have a hard time dealing with problems, facing them, at least like I can't read my poetry.] (inaudible at 0:38:47) I can't do it. Stuff like that. I really would not be surprised if the world ended in our generation. I think there is a non-trivial possibility. I don't know what to do with that. (laughs) (long pause) 0:40:49 (breaking voice) It's like the depression feels like it's taking away everything I like about myself and now it's the only thing that defines me. There are a few years in there where I didn't think of myself, primarily under the rubric of somebody who is depressed, and I was really proud of that. (sniggers) But now, [...] (inaudible at 0:41:41) says being here is very open about this for a gentile, which I still find hilarious. (voice breaks) I told him there is nothing else in my life. This is the only thing I can talk about. I know it's an exaggeration to say there is nothing else in my life, but everything else is so tied up in this that I can't talk about anything else honestly without talking about this. That sucks. (laughs) [00:42:33]</p> (sniffles) (pause) At one time—I had to be twenty or something around there—I thought to myself that thinking of myself as not primarily someone who is depressed is how I'm going to get out of this. That's really important for not actually being depressed, and I think that was true. That seemed to keep it from coming back. (pause) [00:44:55]</p> The last thing was something that I was thinking about on the way to the bus stop this morning and just occurred to me right now.</p>",0
1004528625.txt,"I like your dress very much. The weather has certainly changed. (phone ringing) I'm just going to turn this off. So, I got a call on Thursday night from (inaudible) to my brother, saying that my dad was in the ER because his friend had come to... I don't know, the story was kind of confusing. Something about his friend, my dad's friend, who was going to visit him in Georgia, and then my dad called him and said he shouldn't come, couldn't go on his trip. Long story short, my dad was in the ER because he had been drinking again.</p> He had been drinking again.</p> I don't exactly know what he went to the ER for. I know the friend ended up coming down and his wife came too, and they were involved with getting him to the ER, either in the - everyone is kind of confused as to whether my dad asked to go or whether they forced him to go and I just got - (yawns). When my uncle had talked to my dad, my uncle had said you know, you had been doing great the whole time we were down, because my uncle was down when we were too, and he said what happened, and my dad said that he had been drinking the whole time that we had all been down there also. And that just, you know I had left saying that (chokes up) (pause)... [00:02:00]</p> I have no - no. I don't know if it was because of the throwing up the blood or because he wanted to dry out safely. I don't know what it was. (pause) You know, like nobody calls me directly. Somebody calls my brother and then my brother calls me. (clears throat) And then, so that - so Thursday that happened, and then I called my girlfriend Emma and said just can you come over for a walk, and we went for a walk to talk about it. Because Chris, I have a hard time, because like Chris wants to really be there for me, but I get there and he just says, do you want to talk about? And then he doesn't ask any - he's just like such a typical guy, and I just have a hard time just like spilling my guts immediately, as soon as it happens. [00:05:55]</p> Just somebody to vent. I feel like he relies on me to be the person who hears him, to be the person who immediately he turns to, which is fine for the most part, but not for like a few hours every week. (pause) Like I just, I feel like he relies on me to like I don't know, make sure that... (pause) I don't know. Like what he's - the way he's approaching things is like I don't know. (pause) Put it this - I don't know. Maybe he doesn't - I just feel like there's a lot that he needs that I can't help him with. [00:14:22]</p> Yeah. I think somebody who is a professional could.</p> I don't know, just offer - I mean just what I'm here for, the same kind of thing, just honest feedback that isn't - that has no tie to his outside life. You know to - it's a person who can be completely honest with him, without any... anything there bringing into the situation, you know? With me, he knows by bringing certain things up or by talking about certain things, where I'm coming from, because there's all these other things going on. You know, if we're talking about things with our family, if we're talking about things with school. There's already a whole set of baggage that I bring to it, that he's already aware of, and so just having somebody else who's not connected to his life, who he knows, it's like a safe place for him to go and just (pause) talk for a period of time. I just feel like he needs that. [00:15:53]</p> Just my own certain you know, like when he talks about stuff with our dad, like I have a different feeling on it sometimes. Or when he talks about his drinking, I have a different feeling on it you know? And he knows that um, (pause). I don't know, I guess it's also easier for me to let my emotions and my love for him take over and be - that be driving force, instead of like my rational brain. And so I'll just sometimes tell him things are okay when they're not okay, just because I love him and I don't want to - it's either like the easiest way to get something done or I just don't want to hurt his feelings. And somebody else isn't going to necessarily do that, because they don't - it doesn't matter. You know like or I won't say something because I don't want to get in a fight with him, and like that's not going to matter to a professional who doesn't have - who isn't his sister. (long pause) [00:18:04]</p> Mm-hmm. Not so much - I mean now that he agreed to go see somebody, I feel like a little - I feel really relieved. I feel like it's the first time he's really wanted to help himself and, and I feel relief that like I'm not... (pause) I just felt pressure before not you know. (pause) I just felt like I'm the only one that can, that can like fix this. I'm the only one that you're like talking to about these things, so I'm the only one can fix this, when in reality I know the only one that can fix it is him. But like I felt this pressure and I'm a little relieved of it now, just because I feel like he's kind of taking it into his own hands by doing something for himself. I don't know maybe that's crazy. [00:19:21]</p> Just that like nothing really changed but this one thing, so. (pause) Like I get all hopeful and then...</p> Yeah. I just want someone to - I want him to do something. I want him to make a choice. I want him to care about himself. I don't want to depress him more and I want you know, I just want him to take control of the situation. I don't feel like he's driving the ship. I feel like he's just bobbing along. He like masks it in all these other ways. He reads all these books about psychology and he's listening to all these like self-help things, but it's all a bunch of bullshit, because he does it for like a month and then it's on - like it's just something new, and it's all, it's just bullshit. (pause) [00:20:50]</p> I mean why else do people go to therapy?</p> Well I'm not here because I want him - I mean, I'm not only - I'm not here just - I'm here for myself.</p> But I mean everybody goes to therapy to better something about themselves or to heal from something or you know, to help themselves in some way, and that's all I want him to do. I just want him to help himself (pause) and this worked for me. I don't give a shit what the hell works, I don't. If rubbing magic stones works together, rubbing - like if that works for him, I don't give a shit what he does. I just want him to do it, because he's - like he's dying, he's killing himself. And I - it's killing, like it's killing me. (chokes up)</p> Because he's my brother, I love him. (pause) And that's just not ever going to go away. (pause) I don't want that to go away. I want to be this fiercely protective over him. It's just how it - I don't think that there's anything wrong with that. (sniffles)</p> How protective I feel of him.</p> No. Yeah.</p> Mm. Yeah I know. I know I'm going to be really disappointed if it doesn't - if he doesn't - if he doesn't. Like I have a lot of fear that he'll leave today and just say like that sucked, that woman is full of shit. He already said to me the other day, like oh, why does she have all the answers? And I just said, like she doesn't have any more answers than you do, and I don't think she has necessarily any answers, but you don't need to look at it that way. You just need to look at it as a place to go and talk and feel free to just say anything that you need to get off your chest. It doesn't need to be a place to go find answers.</p> Mm-hmm. Yeah of course, it kills me to... (chokes up) (pause) But would I feel that way if he was choosing the opposite path and like anything else? Do you know what I mean? Like I don't think that... (pause)</p> You don't think it's true?</p> I don't know, do you - I don't know. Maybe it's not accurate.</p> I don't know.</p> I don't know, because I am a nut-bag. (pause)</p> (laughing)</p> A bag of mixed nuts over here. Because you said such an interesting analogy and so I - because I, you know that I question everything. I said - because then to me that means that you think that it's not accurate. [00:29:30]</p> I don't know, trust me I don't know.</p> I don't - that's what I do.</p> Because unless, unless I hear like yeah, that makes sense, or unless I hear like a concrete agreement, I think that whatever somebody says is in disagreement.</p> (laughs) I do.</p> I told you, it's a bag of nuts over here. I mean not a lot, that's dramatic, that's like a little intense, but I interpret a lot - I mean it just makes me question myself and what I'm saying and thinking. I don't think it's a bad thing. I think I should be questioning things that I'm saying and thinking. (pause) Oh god. (pause) I'm, I just, I'm using all of your tissues. (sighs) The thing is that as soon as everything happened with my brother, I just, like I just stopped really caring about what was going on with my dad. I mean not stopped caring about it, but it was like it completely paled in comparison to the feelings that I had about my brother being that drunk and that sad sounding and that out of control, and that I had never - I hadn't heard him say he wanted to kill himself. I mean he wasn't saying I'm going to kill myself, but by saying I want to go face first over a cliff, hearing him say that, it made my feelings towards my situation with my dad feel like eh. Like I care and I'm upset and I'm like, I was more sad about... (clears throat) How do I say this? It was like I had - it just made me realized like how little I care about my dad in comparison to how much I care about my brother, and it made me feel like (pause) everything that I care about with my dad is just a reflection of like how it affects me. Like it's just I care. [00:32:35]</p> Yeah of course. It's like I see all these feelings that I've had and that I've felt, and he's having them. And it's just like, and then you just know that feeling and then it's this person that you love so much and it's like, and you know why they're there and you know - I mean it's just, I can't describe it. Yeah of course it's because of a lot of the same feelings that I felt, and because of the same experiences and because of the same situation. And with my dad I feel like it's just all self-inflicted. And maybe it's not. Maybe it's because of trauma he's had in his past that he hasn't dealt with, bla bla bla bla bla. All I know is that me and my brothers have pain that's because of his choices, and now we're in the position of having, now we have to make choices, and we have to decide to change our behavior and our you know, watch the hand that we were dealt with our DNA and watch these certain you know, things that maybe we're more prone to, and help heal from some of the things that he's inflicted, so that we don't carry forward this pattern. And so that makes me resentful of him and angry towards him, and it makes me also really scared for my brother. Like change it, change it, like I'm going to change it, don't you want to change it? Let's change it, let's not do this, we can't do this. We can't, like we can't recycle these problems again because it's been recycled for so many generation and like we have to, we have to stop. We can't keep doing this. [00:35:14]</p> He has to get with the program. He has to get onboard, because he's onboard, he says he's onboard, he says he's nothing like it, and then he's just like it. And it's like no you're not, and you're so smart, and you are so self-aware in some ways, but in some ways they're just so - there's this wall. (crying) Oh, so.</p> Yes. I am very frustrated, and I - and then I just... And I feel like no one understands like how much it consumes me. You know, like I feel like I was really reactive all weekend to Chris. Not all weekend, like we had a really nice time, but I was on edge. I was on edge all weekend and little things that bother me. And then I would just be in a bad mood and then I'd cry by myself and it's like - and for me I just think that he should know, like I'm just like, I'm distraught over what's going on with my brother and I can't function. I can't function in this way, that he just goes along, because he doesn't - like if he knew how much I like - how much it consumes my feelings towards my brothers, he would be like you're a little crazy, like that's a little bit intense. [00:37:16]</p> Because it's like, because I just know that nobody else that I am friends with has these feelings of like - like I feel like my brother's well-being consumes me more than like any other person's relationship with anybody. I feel like more than my well-being, you know like Chris is concerned about my well-being. You know it's just like I feel like he would be like that's a little intense and you need to relax, he's a grown man and he can take care of himself. He doesn't. He doesn't say that to me and he understands that I'm upset about it, but why, you know two days later, I'm annoyed about a little thing and I always feel like ahhhh, you should just know that I'm edge right now. And he shouldn't just know. [00:38:23]</p> I guess because I just don't think other people would want to like - I've said to people, you know that feeling that you have where you would like kill somebody if you saw them make your sibling cry? And they're like oh yeah and I'm like no, I would - I would do, like not really, but I have this intense wave take over me when I see my siblings upset, only my brothers really, where I feel physically ill. And they're like no, I don't have that.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah I guess. Because I always feel like they'll look at me like you're a weirdo, that's really intense. [00:39:22]</p> Yeah, if you're like the only person standing alone with that. But I know, I know, I know. It's not, I'm not, and I know that my circumstances are different and that I come from a different background that would make me feel more protective over them. And I know. And if I just explain it. And for the most part Chris is really understanding and really - and doesn't you know, care if I'm on the phone in our living room until 1:30 in the morning on a Thursday. For the most part, he's really understanding and great about it. I don't know, I like - I think I like isolate myself, because I just say like (pause) he you know, they're not going to understand or they're not going to be able to relate to it and then it's going to seem weird because they can't. [00:40:17]</p> Just because I know that they don't feel that way about their siblings, or Chris doesn't feel that way about his siblings. But that doesn't mean he can't necessarily see how I can feel that way. Or at least - or why I at least can't explain it to him. And I think he does. I don't think I even need to explain it to him honestly. I think I'm making a bigger deal of it in my head than needs to be even. Because I don't think he would - I don't think he would actually care and think that I was a weirdo.</p> Yeah. Well it's just always made me feel different. It made me feel like I act this way or react this way because of a certain difference in how I grew up, and that maybe people won't understand that because their experiences were all the - not all the same. I don't - that's obviously like a terrible thing to say, but a lot of my friends had very similar experience, in the sense that they had a mom and a dad who either both went to work, or had a mom who stayed home. They were in a situation that's varied a little bit. You know, my dad had a temper or my mom drank a little more. You know, like everyone has certain things definitely, but everyone I know came from a pretty similar situation. They went to public school, they got good grades, they had a pretty functional family life, there was maybe one or two traumas that happened, a grandparent died or like you know, a parent you know. I don't know, something, got fired from their job, like something, lost their job. I don't know. But for the most part, I feel like I'm the only one who has had a different experience than that and since that you know, like I don't feel like anybody really raised me. I don't feel like anybody - nobody I know has a parent who is an addict, and nobody I know has a parent who was abusive. Nobody I know has a parent who has been to rehab and um, so I just, I feel alone in that I guess, and I feel like because of that, I maybe act a little differently. [00:43:23]</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah. I guess I just feel like I'm the only one who you know, I guess had kind of a trauma or has. And I guess everyone has their own trauma. [00:44:25]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I do feel like that. Well, I've also just had people - I mean I've always felt like people have always down - like they've always kind of looked at me skeptically, like things I would say. Since I wasn't - since a lot of my friends I've had since I was really little, and since at ten years old you're not really going to say really scary things that happened to you at home, especially if you want your friends to come to your house to play. You're not going to say my dad pulled out a gun and said he was going to shoot all of us, or you're not going to say, I heard my dad raping my mom. You know, you're not going to say things like that, so when I would start to say things when I was older... Even at that age, oh I hate my dad, everyone would say like oh I hate my dad too, he grounded me because I didn't do my homework. You know? And I'd be like you hate your dad because he grounded you, like I wish my dad would ground me. And so it would start with things like that and then it would be like, and then I'd get a little older and I'd say my dad is totally out of control, he just drinks a ton. And my friends would be like, yeah my parents drink a lot on the - you know, like my parents drink. They had a party and they all got really drunk. It's like when my dad gets really drunk, he's really drunk at 6:00 in the afternoon, like every day. [00:46:14]</p> Right.</p> Okay, I'm sorry.</p> Okay, sounds great.</p> Bye.</p>",0
1004565043.txt,"So I decided to go to the bridal shower.</p> Basically because at dinner Vincent was over and Vincent had been at [inaudible] with Aimee and Doreen. And he said and Aimee agreed that if I didn't go Doreen would see it as an insult and would retaliate way out of proportion. So - as opposed to retaliating by not coming to my bridal shower someday which would be wonderful. She'd take it as a personal insult and stuff and it's not even because she likes me but because of control.</p> Yes. And the way I deal with people who are jerks is by avoiding them because that way I don't have to be a jerk back. I can just avoid them.</p> Yes. So, even though Cullen - though maybe - I don't know if Cullen is going to be at the bridal shower. I'm not sure if it's coed, but and also because I had told them all that I had rehearsal at 1:00 but the bridal shower starts at 10 in the morning, which is really early. And also it turns out it's being thrown by Doreen's mom. So the whole thing is kind of ridiculous. And why would anyone start a bridal shower at 10 in the morning, on a Sunday morning? Sunday mornings are meant for people to sleep in or something. Or go to church if they go to church. And the whole time all we're going to is sit around and watch Doreen open up presents. And my mom's like oh well your cousins will be there. But these are my cousins who are my mom's age, and I'm just like that's not really going to help me, mom. That doesn't make this any more enjoyable. I don't have anything against those cousins but I have nothing in common with them. They're my mom's friends; they're not my friends. If it were the cousins who are my age it would be one thing but it isn't.</p> No, but why did she invite me then? Meanwhile I haven't even gotten the invitation yet so for all I know maybe I won't get an invitation which I would decide means I wasn't invited. But, yes, I'm going to ask if I can bring Sydney along to make it less horrible because otherwise I think I will go insane. That's a four-hour event or something. But it just sucks that I have to go. It really sucks that the reason I have to go is because Doreen will do something evil to me if I don't. [00:04:18]</p> I mean I always thought that, in the past I guess what it was a couple of years ago with the whole canary incident that she thought it was really cute to torture canaries and stuff, as opposed to just this is animal research; I'm do it because it's necessary. So I don't know what she's done but at least her attitudes have not changed. So, yes, I don't know if she has done anything. Maybe she hasn't. But it's not fair that I have to act like an adult and she will not act like an adult.</p> Yes. I could give her a poisoned yarn.</p> If I don't get arrested, yes. If I, yes, if I don't get caught I would but I probably would get caught, so I wouldn't. It's not like you can really get your hands on poison these days because people don't really keep as many toxic chemicals around in their house like they used to. So it's not a realistic expectation. I can't actively do anything to her. I can't insult her, I can't - I mean I guess if she insults then I reserve the right to insult her back. But unless she actively does something to me I can't do anything even though she's actively offended what matters. Apparently, because when I talked to what mattered to her to and she's like for the sake of family peace and stuff. If I had a job I would care a lot less about family peace, but...</p> I'm dependent right now. My mom's like I never ask you to do anything or don't ask much of you. And I'm like anyone who says that asks a lot of you. You don't say that to someone you never ask anything of. It's like saying no offense before something because as soon as you say no offense before something you're about to say something offensive.</p> This. This is too much but it's not like she's asked too much of me before but she's definitely asked things of me before and, you know, go to these things and other family events and stuff. And usually I will go to things it's just this one I really don't want to because I really hate Doreen and there's not going to be anyone there for me to talk to, and I'm just going to sit there and watch Doreen open gifts for four hours or something. Or maybe there'll be stupid games as well. I don't even know what goes on at bridal showers other than the opening of presents. [00:08:18]</p> And there'll probably won't be anything I can eat. And, yes, I guess people will be talking about how awesome Doreen is. And I really hoping I'm not expected to say anything about how awesome Doreen is. I refuse. I am not going to stand up there and lie about how happy I am to be getting the sister that I never had because that would be a lie. So if anybody expects me to say anything, the answer is no.</p> Yet. That's true. I have that problem. I don't really know what's going to happen other than people will talk, people will eat, and Doreen will open up all the presents.</p> I mean I'm hoping I can at least leave early or something and stay for an hour of it and then go. So I'm not there for the full four hours or three hours because that's a lot of time to be spending with Doreen. And my mom wants me to be friends with Doreen, but she also knows that I hate Doreen. And it's not like I can go up and tell her I hate everyone. I don't really usually hate people. I think my mom knows that I don't usually hate people, so it's kind of annoying that, I don't know, she thinks if we spend enough time together we'll be close or something and it's just not going to happen because Doreen is evil. [00:10:04]</p> Well she also then - the following or the Sunday after my concert, the 20th, , the giant yard store is having a tent sale, and my mom and Doreen were going to it and my mom was like oh you should come along with us. And I don't like the idea of the tent sale, I do not like the idea of being in the car with mom and Doreen for three hours. So Sydney had wanted to show me some places up North anyway so what I think we're going to do is go up there on our own, meet them the minimal amount of time at the yarn store and then spend the rest of the time with Sydney and not be driving in the car for several hours with my mom and Doreen.</p> I don't know why she's going with Doreen in the first place. And I guess Doreen's in that weekend; she's in this weekend too and I guess - yes, because the way how it was I thought was they were if you could - and my mom had said that if you guys went out to dinner with us all weekend instead and I said okay I can do that. But it seems that I'm going to have to go to the actual bridal shower and yes. There's no way they would ever believe that my [inaudible at 00:11:30] rehearsal was moved to 10 in the morning because it's a bunch of college and grad students. No one would want to have rehearsal at 10:00 in the morning. Ever, unless we had a concert that was early afternoon, which would also never happen. And it would have to be that day, which it isn't, so there is no lie I could tell.</p> Wait for it. So I went willingly. Even - my parents asked me; I went willingly. My brother, on the other hand, didn't go willingly and they either alternately bribed him or punished him. And when they bribed him it was like here you could have this new computer if you go to Hebrew school, whereas I was going to Hebrew school and didn't get anything for it. And also - or they punished him by having the computer games withdrawn from my computer so I was being punished for him, which was completely totally unfair. Therefore, if I'm going to this bridal shower I deserve something in return for it.</p> Considering, yes. They never asked me to do anything, that's not true. They made me go to Hebrew school; they made me go to real school.</p> Up until the age of 16. I could've dropped out at 16. I didn't, but I could have.</p> Maybe not real school but Hebrew school. I mean, let's have that Cullen all these years got to get things for being a jerk.</p> I should get things for not being a jerk. That would make it fair because I'm suffering to go to this. I should get something besides just my mom's undying gratitude. I don't even know what that something is, but - because she's also, I'm sure, going to force me if I have a bridal shower she'll force me to invite Doreen even though I don't want Doreen at my bridal shower or I don't want a bridal shower to begin with. You know, she's going to force Doreen to come to my wedding someday, she's going to want us to come for Thanksgiving and then we'll have to be with Doreen for Thanksgiving and, you know. I mean at least any family trips or anywhere I can always say no to those because they're family vacations and I can skip them. [00:14:59]</p> I mean she'll either, no matter who I marry unless they get - Cullen and Doreen get divorced.</p> She's still becoming part of my family and I still have to go to this bridal shower and I just still get some sort of reward for going.</p> I'm just annoyed that Doreen is exerting this control and wants it all to be perfect for her. She doesn't even - I don't think she likes me even. All I know, okay so we went to high school together for a couple of years and then she went to Temple. And most of her opinion of me I am pretty sure comes from what she's heard from Cullen. And Cullen hates me. Therefore Doreen has probably been hearing how horrible of a sister I am and how selfish I am and so I don't think Doreen likes me either or has any desire to become close with me. She probably invited - she's inviting me to this bridal shower expecting me to be there so I'm paying my respects to her, showing her how important she is and not ruining her special day, or her other special day because she already has a wedding as her special day.</p> It's not like I'm her actual sister.</p> Maybe it's conventional to invite them; it isn't conventional to demand them coming. It's not.</p> My mom is demanding and I know that Doreen is going to be upset if I don't now because - but not because she likes me but because she wants to be in control. And I know this from Vincent and Aimee and I believe Vincent and Aimee about this. So the least I can do is get something for my trouble because it is my trouble. It's not fair that Doreen gets her way just because she's willing to be evil to people. If it were just like a normal person who might be - well if it were a normal person who would be disappointed and who wasn't evil, then I... [00:18:22]</p> Nothing usually.</p> Because I'm doing it for my mom and she's asking me for a favor. Therefore I should get something in return for doing this favor for her. And because we've already proved that there's bribery in this family so I should get bribed for doing this. Even if I am an adult because it's only fair to make up for the fact that Cullen always got things for being a jerk. He would be kicking and screaming. It wasn't just no I won't go. You know, he would physically fight them and it was either drag him there kicking and screaming, in which case he would be kicking and screaming and providing a distraction for the entire view of Hebrew school, or let him stay at home and get his way. And the thing with the bribes is then he would get the bribes and it wouldn't even work. He'd still refuse to go. All it is...</p> Yes. If it were something nice it would make it feel fair because I do things for her and it's like oh get together with Grandma, do this, do that. It's not like she's asked me to do nothing. That's not true. [00:20:08]</p> Well either A, the right to not invite her to my bridal shower if I have a bridal shower someday, which would be awesome but probably not going to happen, so I should pray to not invite her to my wedding someday, which would be really awesome but it's not going to happen. Or a large sum of money so I can stop worrying about money.</p> I think about probably a couple of hundred. I'm going to ask her for $1000 or something. You know the time when Cullen was getting his bribes, he got bribed with a new computer for Hebrew school and then I was like okay can I get a new computer? And my parents were like oh well that's your birthday present. And I'm like it wasn't Cullen's birthday present; it was his bribe for being a jerk. That new computer probably was about $1000 or something, I think. This would be the 90s or something. Computers were expensive back then. And so - it would cost them a lot less than it would cost them to bribe Cullen for going to Hebrew school. Either that or it would be stop asking me about jobs ever, and don't put any more pressure on me for that.</p> Because I only thought of them just now.</p> Not any idea of being a decent human being who should just go for the sake of family and therefore not [00:22:20]</p> By asking for a bribe? Well, I'm definitely not being as horrible as Doreen and, I mean it's not the nicest thing in the world to do but when people do things that you want them to do and they don't want to do, if they're disinclined to do it then you can offer them a reward for doing said thing. Come over with your truck and help me move and I'll buy you a pizza or something like that. It's not unheard of.</p> I mean I still think I do deserve it but if I were a better human being I would go and do it even though I do deserve some sort of reward for having to go through this. But I do deserve some sort of reward for having to go through this. It's causing me this much anguish, I hate Doreen this much, Doreen is evil, I don't like her, I don't want to celebrate the fact that she's getting married to my brother. And the fact that I can't just give her a present and have that be enough is really annoying because I'd much rather give her a present and have that be enough rather than coming to the bridal shower. And for anyone else in the world if you give them a nice present and you couldn't, don't go to their bridal shower usually they're happy with the present because you aren't - if you're invited to something and you don't go you're not obligated to get them anything and it's like wow this person went out their way to get me something even though they didn't come to the event. To anyone else in the world this would be considered nice and I would be able to get away with that. With Doreen I can't. [00:24:45]</p> With my mom I can't too.</p> Well it's not like I can call her up and be like hey Doreen will you be upset if I don't go to your bridal shower because I hate you?</p> Yes, I mean the problem is there is no way to get confirmation.</p> Risking something unless I have someone else ask her but I don't know really anyone who's really mutual friends with both of us who could ask.</p> Yes. It's not like you can ask someone who's evil if they're evil and expect them to be like yes I am.</p> Getting something nice in return. It's the only way I can go with little distress because I can't go and be like oh yea, I'm going. I'm so happy; I'm making Doreen happy. Yea. Or I'm making my mom happy. That isn't going to cut it. I don't really care about my mom's happiness right now because she's the one who's sending me to this thing where I hate Doreen.</p> At this point it might be too late. And I guess maybe it isn't really too late unless, until it's the morning of. I mean it's not like I've even gotten the invitation to RSVP. The fact that I'm getting the invitation less than a week before I can be like oh sorry you didn't give me enough notice. But then my mom gave me more notice than that. [00:30:15]</p> Well do I know that I've been invited to go if I haven't heard it from the person that is running the event? Do I really know? You could say that someone's invited but if you don't have confirmation...</p> Well my mom told me...</p> Maybe but my mom got an actual invitation in the mail on Saturday, which is how she then got the confirmation that it's at 10 in the morning. But, yes. It's at 10 in the morning. But I haven't gotten this actual invitation yet so if she got an invitation and I don't get an invitation, how do we really know that I'm invited? Maybe I'm not. Maybe I shouldn't go then because I'm not invited.</p> I mean I could get sick at the last minute.</p> I mean it's at least more plausible than my other plan which was to tell her that I had gotten into a horrible accident and got turned into a cat and then send Frau Zoller there instead of me. But she would beat the word if you're going to throw a cat into a bridal shower you don't throw her in a bridal shower. She would get very upset and hiss and stuff. No one's going to believe that I got into a horrible accident in which I got turned into a cat.</p> But they might believe that I'm sick. But it's not like - and then I don't know whether or not my parents would stop by my place to see if I'm actually sick or something. I just don't know.</p> I don't know if my parents really know how much I don't want to be there. They know I don't want to be there. I don't think they know how strongly I don't want to be there. And I've told them that I don't think that Doreen was done. But they just, I don't know, don't care or oh that was college, she probably grew up by now. It's not like, I don't think people really grow out of being sociopaths. It's not like she was just being mean to people because she was - they had hurt her and she had to hurt them back. She was just mean to people so she could make them miserable. I think that's a personality trait. I don't think that's something you grow out of. Especially - , you know, if you do it in high school that's one thing, but if you're doing it in college then it's like - usually people have grown out of these things by the end of high school, so if she was still doing them in college then there's no way to, I don't think there's any guarantee that she's matured since college. [00:34:06]</p> Poisoned yarn. There's nothing - yes, that's the problem. I can't actually do anything to actually harm her. Then I would feel bad about it.</p> Even though she deserves it?</p> Even though I dislike her and she's done mean things to my friends? She has done mean things to my friends; therefore I think she does deserve it. Unprovoked mean things to my friends. But I can't just do something because she's never done anything to me, therefore I can't do anything to her.</p> I'm only doing it to one person who's already been mean to me. I don't know if that makes me a mean person per se, if they started it and I'm only being mean to them.</p> That she did this stuff? I guess about six years ago.</p> If they apologize for it and show remorse, which Doreen never did. If she felt bad about it and I thought that she actually turned over a new leaf and became a good person then that would be one thing. But if anything she seems proud of the things that she did in college and stuff and - yes. She's just a bad person as opposed to a person who has done some bad things in their past. These are different.</p> Well it makes me feel more frightened and I don't feel like I should forgive her. It just - I would feel bad about being like oh okay Doreen's a great person. I mean like... [00:38:31]</p> Oh I'm still also angry at the fact that she's making me go to this bridal shower, making me become part of this party so that [inaudible at 00:38:50].</p> My mom is.</p> Well I'm angry at my parents too.</p> Okay, but I can hold against Doreen that she's becoming part of this family and I don't like her.</p> You know, if she wasn't having this bridal shower I wouldn't have to go. And if she wasn't marrying Cullen I wouldn't have to go. But she is marrying Cullen and I do have to go because they're having it in a place that I can get to and I have no excuse to get out of that. And I thought I had an excuse to get out of this and no, she had to put it at 10:00 in the morning. [00:40:15]</p> Well I'm surprised other people don't have a desire to sleep in on a Sunday. I mean 10 A.M. is early, especially for my cousins who are coming from farther away. Or my - well I guess my mom always wakes up early. But, yes, my cousin Maggie's coming and she's coming from Vermont, which is further than [inaudible] and is probably a few hours away. It's a long drive. So then she's like we have to be up at 8:00 or something on Sunday morning, which is really early. And Doreen's family is coming from New Hampshire and they would have to leave at 9:00. So I'm really surprised that no one's desire to sleep in on a Sunday morning came into the equation.</p> There's no way to deliberately get myself sick. I can only lie and say I'm sick, or manage to get sick, which could happen. I don't know that it will happen but it could happen but I can't really count on it. I don't know anyone who's really ill right now who I could like hang out with and get their germs from. [00:42:26]</p> Yes. It would solve all the problems though. And if it was - I wouldn't try to get myself something that could kill me but if it would get me...</p> ...sick for a few days, I'd be willing to be sick for a few days even if it did make [inaudible at 00:42:52] a little bit more difficult since I'd be sick during (inaudible) then but...</p> Well the adult way would be to be like okay I don't want to go to this bridal shower. Here's a present. And the adult thing for her would be okay, thank you for this present. Sorry that you couldn't make it. And the adult thing for my mom would be to accept my decision to not go and be like okay well you're giving her this present, that's good.</p> Because my mom won't accept it. She's the one who won't accept me not going and just giving a present.</p> Yell at me? I don't know. Add more guilt. Keep on telling me how she never asks me to do anything even though that's a lie.</p> I don't know.</p> I don't like being yelled at either.</p> I don't know if I dislike being yelled at more than I dislike being at bridal showers of people I hate, but neither of them are really good options. [00:44:12]</p> Especially when I was originally saying I have rehearsal and if I had rehearsal then it would have been fine.</p> Unless I can get them to change rehearsal to 10:00 in the morning. And the problem I can't even lie and say that there's a sectional because my mom knows that I'm the only tenor, so an tenor sectional would be me.</p> Pretending to be sick is an option. Actually being sick is an option that I have little control over. Going and being miserable is an option. Going and insisting that Sydney also be able to come is...</p> I'm not sure if it's a coed shower. It might be a coed shower. It might not be. Cullen might be - I don't know. I have to ask my mom about that because I'm not sure it's a coed shower. Running away and getting a new identity and stuff probably wouldn't be...</p> ...a realistic option.</p> But pretending to be sick is a realistic option. And I mean I've been getting sick a lot. So it really wouldn't be that impossible that I got sick again because being sick all the time doesn't reduce your possibility of being sick again and there could still be things going around. But it's not like my mom would be seeing me on a day-to-day basis and see how the next day oh, I'm fine. She wouldn't know. [00:46:22]</p> And get yelled at.</p> Or demanding some sort of reward for going, which might actually be my best option at this case at this point.</p> No.</p> Basics (ph). A week. A week from yesterday. I have one week to make my final decision. I thought it was farther away but as it turns out no it's not.</p> Yes, I went. So she [inaudible at 00:47:32] me about the whole not wanting to take me off Welbutrin if there was no other option. And I told her about the whole escapades with the SSRIs that had the doctor in the ER who told me I had Seratonin syndrome, though of course at this point it was six years later so I can't even remember what exactly had gone wrong that I went to the ER in the first place and why they thought...</p> So then she was like okay then we're not going to do the ones that have even like a little working on Seratonin. Most of them work on more Epinephrine, like [inaudible at 00:48:10] or whatever or effects for right now. So it does reduce the options. Like right now she thought the problem I guess was the Xanax. If I keep on taking it multiple times a day then I could get - it doesn't last that long and then I'm getting withdrawals. And the fact that before seeing her I'd gone a good four or five days without taking any medication, did not have any bad effects so she didn't think I was absolutely addicted to it. But she, but she wanted to - oh yes. I can't go above the 450 on the Welbutrin because it carries the risk of seizure. So... [00:48:52]</p> I'm already at the 450. And she didn't want to go up too much more or any more on the Seroquel because it carries a risk of diabetes long term. So what we're doing right now is decreasing the Seroquel a little bit and I've been instead taking at night a Klonopin and that way the effects of the anti-anxiety stuff will last during the day. And I still don't have a problem during the night; the problem is every day since then I've been tired during the day. I've still been able to do stuff, like yesterday when I had my concert, beforehand when we were in the practice room, I was - pretty much whenever we weren't singing I was down on the floor because I was really tired. And...</p> I think it's from the Klonopin. And I mean I guess the next step I could do is because it seems like they're not encapsulated or anything so I could use a pill cutter and take half of it even though she's given me the smallest pill. Or I could go back to the Xanax because she said I could either do the - take the Xanax as needed or take the Klonopin every night. I just can't mix them. [00:50:16]</p> Yes. I mean I also - I guess I can wait and see if I still feel tired a few days later.</p> My panic is fine. I have not been panicking since that.</p> But at the same time there was a time yesterday, a time today that I was feeling a little bit depressed, not like super depressed and not like self-harm wanting...</p> Just for short periods during the day. But still wanting to curl up in a ball and cry and...</p> Maybe but I was feeling that way yesterday too and stuff so. I wasn't actively thinking about the shower, though. But I guess I did like to...</p> Yes, I'm going to see her in a month from that past Tuesday.</p> Yes.</p>",0
1004687718.txt,"Yeah.</p> From withdrawal.</p> Yeah. I feel kind of dizzy and out of it.</p> Withdrawal is not that much fun, as I have had occasion to learn because I cannot remember to refill it. I really should renew my prescriptions to a pharmacy that's open all the time. But that will happen when it will. Yeah, so I'm way less woozy than I was half an hour ago, like it's just starting to kick in. And if I get tired in the middle of the session that will probably also be explained by having not taken.</p> (Laughs) But I seem to have developed enough of a tolerance to it that it doesn't work anymore at the dose that I take so I'm going to taper off of it because it doesn't, I almost never take it for anxiety and so, I don't really need it for anxiety as much and it's not working as a sleeping thing anymore and the Depakote which helps me sleep and so. [00:01:16] (Pause, sighs) I had breakfast this morning with my friend Candace (sp?) and her boyfriend who I got to meet. It's very funny, they've been dating for like eight or nine months now and I haven't seen, the last time I saw Candace (sp?) was the first weekend after he'd asked her out, like the first week after she had gone on the first date. So her being really excited about this new guy and then she didn't go away so I think it was for real, probably a good thing. And now they've been dating long enough that it's like they have the same facial expressions (laughs) he's like picked up on a couple of her facial expressions and she's picked up on a couple of his and it's very funny. I like it so that seems good.</p> (Pause) Yeah, she (pause) dated a man from, who was in the Master's program with us while I was living with her. That ended poorly so it is (inaudible at 00:02:32)</p> Yeah, yeah. And she was, I think, dating around before that and having a good time with it. She's in Texas now. That's a very specific social scene, like you pretty much have to like to talk about politics in order to live in Texas (Laughs) And I don't like to talk about politics, but Candace (sp?) does so it's good. (Pause) Still not doing so well, but what do we do? I mean, that was a rhetorical question (laughs). [00:03:13] Yeah (pause) I'm having trouble in talking with James (pause) balancing (pause) you know (pause) really how to talk to him (pause). It's rare that half of my mind isn't on being sad or whatever. [00:03:50] (Pause) And I can't just talk about that with him. It wears him out. He tries not to say that (inaudible at 00:04:02) and then he tries not to show it, but it wears him out. So again what do we do? [00:04:12]</p> I'm sorry? Yeah. (Pause) Yeah, like feeling like people are going to be really bothered by me kind of, you know I do that thing where somebody tells a story and I'm like, oh! I have a story that's kind of like that and then I tell that story, which drives me nuts in myself and in other people. You know and it comes from a, like I really try to build connections with people very fast, like I really am trying to find, yeah places of contact but it's hard to keep that at the appropriate level. [00:07:17] (Pause) My mom did ask whether I had a job yet, she remembered. And then she talked about the power outages in Texas which, to be fair, that would be a story that I would want to tell (laughs). That would have been a mess, alright I think it was a mess for a lot of people.</p> She has to buy a new refrigerator because when the power came back on it killed her refrigerator. (Pause) I don't know. [00:08:17] (Pause) Sometimes I'm like, guys you're my parents this should be about me a little more (laughs). (Pause) And in a sense it is (pause), you know with mom pretty much all the conversations go like that but my dad is not that way. But (pause) I don't know, I think it's just hard for people that are close to me but that I don't talk to all the time to remember that I'm not doing well. And so I feel like I don't want to keep constantly reminding people. (Pause, crying) And it's like, it's going to get boring (laughs) but, I wish people remembered. [00:09:25] (Pause) And then James has told me that when I talk about it I talk about it in a tone of voice that indicates that I don't want to talk about it anymore, which is probably true. I mean almost certainly true.</p> (Laughs) Yeah. I want most things both ways. (Pause) Yeah because I both, I wish people remembered and I don't want people to have to deal with it, and so. [00:10:27]</p> Yeah. When I am the one who brings it up it's much easier to feel like I am being selfish in that way or that I am being a drain on the other person, that I am exhausting them. And part of it with my dad is he's constantly saying things like 'I don't want to pry. I don't want to pry'. Which is really nice that he has that much respect for my emotional space, I recognize that I am very lucky in having my primary parent be that way, having enough friends with parents who don't understand the concept of space. But it's hard for me to say in a way that he will hear 'no you will never be prying on this subject. I want you to ask. I want to be talking about it'. [00:11:45]</p> It seems like it, yeah. Not (pause), yeah. I don't, there's not really much new to say on it. I mean, I still just feel like crap. You know not all of the time, but enough of the time. (Pause) And I (pause) I don't know how useful it is for me to just constantly repeat myself (laughs). (Pause) You know I still cut myself, still worried about suicide and have to cut myself to (groans). [00:13:01]</p> (Crying) I umm, it was I guess three to six days ago and for two nights in a row so I guess three and four days ago. I don't remember any more actually. (Pause) Yeah. I think one of the nights, the first time, was the last time I called you. so that was four days ago? I don't remember. (Pause) Yeah I (pause) it's one of those I (pause) have again this tension between not wanting to be doing this, wanting to stop, but also this is in a lot, you know this is better than the alternative in some ways, you know continuing to feel really bad and worrying about doing more damage to myself. [00:14:40] (Pause) And just wanting to have control, wanting to feel like I can do something that will make me feel better. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) And there, yeah there's also part of it (pause) I don't know, I think part of me wants to mark how bad this is in some way. [[00:15:54] (Pause) I'm not sure why. Maybe because as soon as I feel better I forget what it's like to feel so bad.</p> (Pause, exhales) Umm, (pause) yeah it's not consistently that horrible, or it's not always that horrible but it is consistently getting, it gets that horrible. (Pause) I just (pause) I'm just scared that I don't have a job, I have an apartment, I told you about the apartment right?</p> Yeah I took it so I feel good about that. [00:17:09]</p> Yeah, yeah. And -</p> It's in the Square so, so much closer.</p> Yes! It's like five minutes to the train and then one train stop so ten to fifteen minutes. And if I walk it's only twenty minutes. And it's a nice walk so I'll probably try to do that as much as I can because that's the only exercise I get so probably should do that.</p> Yeah, yeah they told me that. But I also have been told that, you know, the studies are based on walking thirty minutes a day three times a week so I figure that's good enough (laughs) yeah. Also the breathing (inaudible at 00:18:08) (laughs). [00:18:10] (Pause) I (pause) it's like it doesn't (pause) it doesn't get any less bad, but I've come to expect it to be that bad and so I know that I'll get through it. And so I'm less likely to reach out during it. Does that make sense?</p> (Pause) Yeah. I'm thinking well I can do this on my own, I'm going to be okay. (Pause) Yeah it's (pause) it's pretty confusing. I don't, it's hard for me to tell like how, it's hard for me to predict when things will be bad and when they won't. [00:19:23] (Pause) And (pause) I also just have this really strong like pushing back against it, you know like trying not to get worked up and then pushing back against that because then I, you know, start to feel like I'm losing my soul and so I don't want that and (pause) yeah and it feels like a dream in some ways. In that it's like everyone else is living in this different world, and I know they're not all actually living in a different world, I know that there's a lot of really sad people out there. But I can't really (pause) it's hard for me to look outward. [00:20:44]</p> Which is the worst part. That it's just so selfish. It just demands that I be so selfish. I can't, it's hard for me to think outside of myself right now, I hate that. (Pause) So yeah. (Pause) I made it down to church yesterday, on very wobbly legs, (laughs) yeah I just looked straight ahead and focused on not running into things. But, I don't know, the priest recognized me but couldn't remember my name, which is typical, I mean (inaudible at 00:22:03) he recognized me. [00:22:05] And it's a huge parish, like five thousand people, which I really like because it's like, kind of a priest's kid a little anonymity in the church is a good thing. And he said 'how are you?' And I kind of said 'I'm okay'. And as soon as I said it I realized that I was, I clearly wanted him to know that I was not okay and I clearly wanted him not to have to say anything about it, but wanted to just keep going.</p> Yeah I guess so. (Pause) Yeah. [00:23:06] (Pause) You know, if I, it's the end of the day, it was really hot, there's no air conditioning in the church so that it's like fancy historical buildings, famous architecture or whatever. I think it's really ugly actually, which is good (laughs). And (pause) it's like I really want people to help me but I don't want it to be hard for them. And I don't see how it's not hard for them. And I don't actually quite know why I just want to tell everyone about this because it's not like talking about it necessarily makes me feel better, sometimes it makes me feel better sometimes it makes me feel worse. [00:24:17] (Pause) I don't know, I (pause) I sometimes don't know why I can't just keep my mouth shut.</p> Yeah.</p> (Pause) Mmm. Maybe, but not necessarily.</p> (Pause) I just (pause) I just don't want to waste time, which I realize is a fairly silly thing to say (laughs). And I don't really know what to say about it. I don't (pause) I don't know how to talk about it, how to describe it. (Pause) But yeah, I mean there is only so many times you can say the same thing over and over again, even if it's still true. [00:26:35] (Pause) And have it be, you know, bearable to hear. (Pause, sighs) I'm not dizzy anymore.</p> (Laughs) I have to remember to take my prescriptions. It doesn't help that I live, you know, forty-five minutes away from the pharmacy. (Pause) Yeah I just, I don't know what to say. [00:27:46] (Pause) I'm not sure (pause) as I see it this therapy is all about kind of, you know, collecting data. The same way that everything is all about collecting data, you know every kind of puzzle is about finding all of the pieces you can and putting them together in a way that makes sense. And so -</p> Yeah. [00:28:48] And it's a lot of, a lot of it is less what you have said and more the way I think about problems.</p> Yeah. So I don't know that it (pause) is (pause), so it's hard for me to think of it as useful to say the same things over and over again, you know? (Pause) Especially when it can pretty much be taken as a given.</p> The data in my mind gives it a very vague word. (Laughs) And I'm a researcher so I think -</p> Yeah I know. But I kind of feel like I'm using different terminology to talk about what you've already talked about, if that makes sense.</p> (Both laugh) And this that like (pause), you know I think of every (pause) interpersonal interaction, every idea, every way of phrasing things, like it's all, it just (pause). I mean I guess my model of how people solve problems is just that they look and then they figure things out, what they see. And the point is that you need to see as much of what's out there as possible in order to get a clear idea. [00:31:29] And particularly with human emotions which have way too many variables to deal with, like I have to do (chuckles). Maybe you haven't figured out but (both laugh).</p> (Exhales) I don't know where I'm going with this. (Pause) Yeah you're probably not going to buy it (laughs).</p> (Pause) And I don't have time for. I really (pause) I don't (pause, crying) when I'm as upset as I am I don't know how to function. (Pause, crying) You know, I can't move. Or I, well I can usually move, but I certainly don't do the dishes (laughs). And I'll do my work.</p> Yeah. (Pause) Yeah. (Pause) But mostly it feels like you know, I get up and start doing the things that I need to do because I have decided that it's time for me to stop being sad. (Pause) I mean maybe that is just a pattern that comes from my deciding not to be sad so much of the time. I just feel like I couldn't keep up with my life if I (pause).</p> Yeah I'm pretty combative today. You know Candace (sp?) does that to me sometimes (laughs).</p> I'm trying to think through it. And the way that I usually think through things is stating that I believe this to be the case and then seeing what kind of case I come up with as I talk.</p> It drives James insane. He figures out what he wants to say and then he says it (laughs).</p> Yeah. And actually it doesn't irritate him anymore, I think. It just took him a couple years to realize that that was genuinely the way that I thought best and roll with it. Just as I've learned to become comfortable with long silences while he figures out what he wants to say. It has taken me a while (chuckles). Especially when we're having a fight. [00:35:22]</p> (Laughs) Oh gosh (laughs). I'm sorry. I think part of it -</p> Well I don't like lawyering people into anything. (Pause) I don't like the idea of it. [00:36:36]</p> I don't know that I want you to be quiet about them. I think part of this is because I'm genuinely not convinced and part of it is because I don't know how to start, like I don't (pause) I don't know how to change the way I deal with emotions and so it's easier to come up with reasons why I shouldn't change them.</p> Yeah. You're absolutely right on all of those things (laughs). Yeah. (Pause, crying) I just feel like I'll lose people. (Pause) I feel like I'm not the person that they think they know anymore. And I don't have (pause, crying) and sometimes it still comes naturally to me to step up for the occasion, you know, to say 'okay I am meeting my friend and her boyfriend this morning, I am going to be cheerful'. That is easy for me to do.</p> And (pause) I just don't know what my life would look like if I didn't try to manage my feelings. I mean I haven't ever had a life in which I didn't feel it was of utmost importance to manage my feelings pretty strictly. (Pause, crying) I haven't (pause). Part of this is from, you know if I dwell on feeling bad I feel worse. And there's so much what may or may not be crap about the power of positive thinking and just put good thoughts in your head and you'll feel better, and I don't know how to process that. [00:41:34] (Pause) And (pause) I find that I can't deal with people who are sad all the time. I find that I can't, I have to step away from them for my own, you know, self-preservation. And so what am I going to do when the people in my life suddenly start stepping away from me? (Pause) I just genuinely do not know how to disconnect that says no, now it's time to put your game face on. Like, okay that's enough crying, now you have to go do this.</p> Yeah. Okay.</p>",1
1004478012.txt,"(inaudible at 00:01:33) and I talked and fixed the fight a little bit.</p> That I tried to bring up. I don't know how to deal with him when he's acting like that. And I think it went well (inaudible at 00:02:02). It started where he brought it up and then he started discussing that I really have a hard time bringing things up, which I do. And he (inaudible at 00:02:15) I think that he's — like, as long as he's happy I'm happy. And if he never had any conflict and that I'd never have any conflict either. I guess which is true and then I started thinking about why it's so hard for me to bring topics up. Because once I'm talking about them, I'm, like, okay talking about my feelings, but it can't (inaudible at 00:02:41) really hard for me to initiate those tough conversations. But it basically (inaudible at 00:02:50) that he thinks that, you know, my happiness is obviously based on someone else's mood. I feel that it can be true. I don't want to fight and maybe it's just, like, you know, once there's a conflict you're almost, like, fine never speaking of it again, and that (inaudible at 00:03:11) brought this up, we probably wouldn't have talked about it. [00:03:14]</p> I think about it and I just don't know how to say it. Like, and I know the type of conversation that I want to have. It's, like, literally, I just can't initiate it. Yeah, and I feel like before, like, it was a little bit of like, I don't know if I want to say this or — but, like, he and I are comfortable talking. But once we talk (inaudible at 00:06:05) I feel like I'm really (inaudible at 00:06:06) or I can trust more and just that initial — I don't know if it's maybe I don't know how it's going to be received, and I'm still kind of like, pull back a little bit. But yeah, it's literally just the — I want to talk, opening phrase that I can't. I have such a hard time (inaudible at 00:06:29). I feel like it's getting better, but — or, like, he'll bring things up and I'll be, like, damn (inaudible at 00:06:41) to talk about it. Not that I (inaudible at 00:06:44) beat me to it. But I feel like he's getting frustrated because sometimes he thinks that I don't even think of those things or I don't care. And (inaudible at 00:06:50) I do care and I'm thinking about it and, like, trying to find the right way for it to come out. [00:06:55]</p> (inaudible at 00:08:48).</p> Yeah, like, I feel more just like defeated, like, I feel like I take things, like, personally, but at that moment they're probably like just things that are coming out of your mouth, or that he's (inaudible at 00:09:13) in. I feel like I'm like, I'm answering all your questions and you're still not making any sense. And so, you know (inaudible at 00:09:24) scary or still annoyance there, I don't know if I dig deeper that there's maybe a scared part, but I don't know.</p> Yeah. Well, then I don't know if hurt is the word, but kind of like what — like, I've done the research; I can answer all your questions. How come you're not listening? Why aren't my answers good enough or — I don't know (inaudible at 00:09:55). I feel like he can be, like, a know-it-all sometimes and kind of like, why do you think you know it all? Like, I have information too here, like hello, and then I feel like (inaudible at 00:10:06). And the stupid computer is really just (inaudible at 00:10:11) and everything and I'm like, answering questions and he's challenging things that I have an answer (inaudible at 00:10:16). But I don't know if it's scary, maybe. (inaudible at 00:10:32) difficult conversation (inaudible at 00:10:34) think about because I can't talk to him or (inaudible at 00:10:38) and I don't really talk in that type of way much. But (inaudible at 00:10:45) him and I, it's important for me to be able to initiate if something's bothering me. (inaudible at 00:10:55) I feel like I just clam up. [00:10:58]</p> I think — yeah, I think he does, but I feel like he doesn't give me that benefit of a doubt. Because, like, we have had conversations, like, you do know me; do you really think that it was like this? And he said (inaudible at 00:12:14) no, but it can feel like that sometimes, and then I feel bad that he feels like that because I feel like my intention is not to come across that way. But (inaudible 00:12:30) like, paralyzed with, like, fear sometimes, so —</p> I think not having a response that I would want to hear. (inaudible at 00:12:59) or one that I don't know how to deal with at the moment, and then being upset and me feeling like have to make an answer or make a decision. I don't like not knowing because we (inaudible at 00:13:18). So I feel like be in that position, feeling like I need to make a decision (inaudible at 00:13:23) what to do and then there's a lot of the discomfort that comes with it. (inaudible at 00:13:30) usually, or then sometimes, like, with he and I, like a fight comes out of it and then this happens a lot. So, like, I want to talk about stuff when he's here in person because it's much easier to talk face to face. But then I'm like, worried about conversations are going to go badly or if we're going to have a fight out of it, so that I don't bring it up because I don't want to ruin our weekend. And then I'll kind of bring it up, like, after the visit's over. I know that he finds that pretty frustrating. [00:14:00]</p> Right.</p> Right. My reaction is until I resist, like, the fighting type. Maybe I guess I'm — I understand that I guess I'm just sort of responding to, like, you feel like a fight is inevitable. And I guess what I'm saying is not only is a fight not inevitable, but you actually have control over whether you're actually fighting. And I don't know why I feel so strongly, like, about that, like, with him because I feel like he's very nice and, like, when you do talk with him, like, about a serious thing he's — like, we joke about it and we say, like, mean things to each other that can be kind of funny sometimes. But in a serious environment, like, he's very nice and understanding, but I don't know. (inaudible at 00:14:56) it's just like bad interactions that I've had with my parents that have just done a number on me to initiate (inaudible at 00:15:05) I don't know. [00:15:06]</p> I just think — I don't know, like, well, not so much — my mom just doesn't speak, but, like, with my dad, it's just never — like, everything gets turned around on you and then you end up being selfish or ungrateful. And then, I don't know, you tend to leave the conversation feeling like, you know, what just happened? I was having, like, a conversation here, he turned it around to be something about me that's way down there, and then just it not being worth it, and then it stirs up, like, other types of feelings that I have. And I guess not worth it is kind of the best word to use. And so I don't, you know — I feel like I'm just very different from that, but still not close, like hesitations. And then I get frustrated with myself because I'm, like, you know that he's a different person. You know how he reacts and that, like, you two can converse, so why can't you just do it? [00:16:26]</p> Right. You know (inaudible at 00:16:36) I'm tolerant of (inaudible at 00:16:38). I feel like I just (inaudible at 00:16:46) and then I get more — I feel like sad and, like, upset with myself when I become intolerant with myself because then I'm just really annoyed that I can't — like, it's not easy, but yeah, that I just can't make myself do it or like me knowing — well, not from experience but conversations with (inaudible at 00:17:10) usually go well and still, I just can't do it. Kind of like you said, like, doesn't he know me well enough to, you know, know that it is on my mind that I care. Like, I know him well enough to know that he, you know, has conversations and is respectful and not nasty, but again, I still can't push through. So I end up feeling like just stuck. [00:17:46]</p> Hmm, right. And then I don't think I know what to do with that when I feel like that. So, you know, I'm not sure what to do with that feeling (inaudible at 00:19:07).</p> Um-hmm. And I know, like, I can't make everything happen because I'm not in control of everything, but I think it's I'm so fixated on what that their response could be, that if it's not to my liking or what I want to have happen, then I just don't know how to, like, deal with those emotions to proceed from there. And then I think I just don't like being in that position so much that I really (inaudible at 00:20:00) myself with it or try not to. [00:20:03]</p> Right. So — but I feel like I — obviously, I can't do that forever, especially, like, I need to do something about it and then I don't know what to do.</p> Um-hmm.</p> Um-hmm. But I feel like that's not good [laughter].</p> Yeah. But I don't like being like that. Like, because I feel that I can converse with him. Like, with my parents I completely feel that that scenario that you just kind of said is true, but with him, I feel like I can talk to him. And I don't think that, you know, when I say something that it's going to be this futile conversation, and yeah, and, like, I don't like not being able to feel that I can bring something up. But I know that that's all me, but I feel kind of (inaudible at 00:21:54) I feel like (inaudible at 00:21:55) right now (inaudible at 00:21:56) a little bit. But —</p> Yeah, I just don't know why I can't — I don't know (inaudible at 00:22:10).</p> I know, but I feel like when I'm thinking about it now, and I'm thinking, like, like I don't really have those bad conversations with (inaudible at 00:22:24). I mean, we bicker over the flights [giggles] whenever. But I feel like when I have, like, major emotions at stake and we're talking about them usually it is okay. But yet, I still can't talk about it. And this is where I start to feel annoyed too because I feel like I want to have, like, an action plan. So no action plans. (inaudible at 00:23:02) and then I don't know if I feel — I don't like it because I feel, like, helpless. Like, okay if I kind of identify the problem, but I don't know what to do about it. That can be a little frustrating to me. (inaudible at 00:23:15) have a problem I kind of identify the why around it, but I don't know how to proceed and move forward. Or if — like, if I do bring it up, the rare occasions I do, it comes off, like, snarky. So it's like I'm (inaudible at 00:23:42) out of it, but kind of being a little, like, sarcastic, and then that's not very good either. But I think I have a habit of, like, if I'm upset, like, I will just (inaudible at 00:24:01) shed light on the topic instead of kind of dealing with it. (inaudible at 00:24:10) I'm not sure what to do about that.</p> I want to. I think I (inaudible at 00:24:26) I want to be in a place where I can converse with my partner and not, I don't know, hesitate or I don't know. Because there are things I want to say and I'm just not saying it until — I feel like I'm waiting for, like, someone to give me, like, the green light to speak, or maybe that's not the (inaudible at 00:24:51). Because I don't feel like I can't talk. I feel like it's all me just not being able to talk. It's not like once I talk that I feel like it's (inaudible at 00:24:59). But, yeah, okay, I feel like the conversation has to be brought up by someone else. And then there's situations, so, like, this was like a common thing where (inaudible at 00:25:15) both kind of upset, so he was probably going to bring it up. And then if there are things that, like, he may not be upset about that I want to talk about, I'm not going to start bringing them up where they come up, like, of them either. (inaudible at 00:25:33) that's good either. And I think that causes grounds for, like, some sort of a fight because I — and I feel like I've always acted like this. Like, I never want to bring something up because it's little, and I probably should, but so then it's like, okay, this little thing upset me. It's not that big of a deal even though it upset me a little bit so I won't say anything. And then the next time comes around and the same thing, and then by, like, the tenth time it comes around, like, I just attack. And I feel like, had I said something the first tense (inaudible at 00:26:17) or maybe the first two small times, the rest of them, you know, have happened or — and so I think — and then — yeah, that people may not even know I'm upset. [00:26:29]</p> I think he's had, like a — he and I had a lot of conversations about conversations. And I think he had really helped me, like, (inaudible at 00:28:29) be honest (inaudible at 00:28:40) a decent conversation (inaudible at 00:28:41) talking. I know I have a problem initiating, so then I end up feeling like — I think part of it — well, I think my parents act a certain way. But then I think part of the reason why they have issues is that I don't say anything. So then, I'm, like, okay, well, now I'm ready to kind of, like, talk about things that upset me and, you know, all of these things that are kind of working with us. So, you know, maybe part of the reason with my parents is that, like, I never said anything, or when I did, like, it came out kind of nasty, but never like a — you know, it really bothers me or hurts my feelings when you do things like this. And so, and then I had some sort of hope that that, like, me changing my technique would be different. But it's not (inaudible at 00:29:35) my mom just doesn't speak much, but it's not with my dad. [00:29:38]</p> Yeah. (inaudible at 00:30:16) well, like, that's a strong word, but yeah, so —</p> Yeah, I mean — yeah, I feel, like, traumatized to me means, like, I don't know, completely — I don't know. I definitely think it's something that, like, sticks with me and has, like, really, like — if I'm in any sort of, like, vulnerable position, like, I'll think of, like, those conversations with, like, the negative reactions. Then I definitely think, like, kind of like, ooh (inaudible at 00:30:53) you know, back off a little bit, or do you really want to have this conversation now? Because if you are, like, upset, like — because I feel like when I leave conversations with my dad, I'm really, really upset. And I know I'm upset about or am upset about whatever we're having the conversation, but then I'm upset of how he, like, handled the conversation, or he made me feel about initiating the conversation, every other kind of low blow I guess that you threw in. So it's just too much and not worth it. [00:31:30]</p> Um-hmm.</p> Yeah, well, I don't know, sometimes I do. Well, maybe this is, like, the helplessness feeling. Sometimes I do and then I'll just end up feeling like really bad, and I don't know, then (inaudible at 00:33:18) I'm sure other people have it much worse, and I probably shouldn't compare myself to other people because my issues are, like, my own thing. And then, I don't know, like sometimes I'm kind of like, this is, like, the end all be all or the whole reason why I act a certain way, and maybe it is. But then when I think about I'm, like, well, that can't be it and I feel like it's almost, like, too much credit, but I don't know if I'm — like, it upsets me that much that I feel that impacted by it, that my response is just, like, no, it can't be that. I don't know. [00:33:58]</p> Yeah. Well, I feel like I wasn't really able to identify it that much until probably the divorce. Like, I knew that my mom was always, like, very quiet, but I don't feel like when they were together everything was status quo and so it wasn't really noticeable. And then I think — so my father will blame the divorce all the time for, like, the demise of everything, and I don't think it was the divorce that made all of these bad characteristics of them. But I think that is what made them show, and so, I don't think that I was really able to identify all of that until, like, I don't know, I was 24 or 25. And, like, I've known, like or felt in bits and pieces like my dad was kind of very self-absorbed, and, like, (inaudible at 00:35:43) like a workaholic and kind of just didn't follow through with, like, family commitments. And (inaudible at 00:35:50) it all became, like, very apparent once they got divorced, there was, like, that kind of, like, realization is very shocking. So and I feel like that's when I felt, like, lonely, but just (inaudible at 00:36:08). I feel like I just looked at them in a different light and, yeah. I feel like that's when their infantile moments really came out, so — but I forgot how we got to this part of the conversation. [00:36:29]</p> Um-hmm. Yeah, so I think growing up, like, I think what I found most upsetting is, like, thinking that it was (inaudible at 00:36:45) like, I don't know. I feel like most people, like, have a happy childhood and they'll look back on it, and it's always a little bit different than you imagine. But I don't know, I just feel like I saw them in this light, and then I started to see them in, like, (inaudible at 00:36:59) that light as a kid, and I don't really know how to explain it. But I feel like the divorce bringing out all of these bad things is, like, when I start to find it upsetting, so — yeah, so I don't know what that has to do with me giving them enough credit for what they did. But (inaudible at 00:37:30) so I end up feeling really bad I guess about, like, the — with that realization and, like, how I view them going forward. Then I feel bad for feeling that, I don't know, strong feeling of disappointment or whatever.</p> Umm, I'm not really sure. I feel like I shouldn't feel bad and then, I don't know, I feel like, I don't know, kind of like the way they communicate and everything kind of just sucks, so then I feel a little bad that I'm in that situation. And then I guess I feel helpless and that's why I get really upset. Yeah, I guess I feel more — I feel bad that they aren't able to, like, identify how their feelings impact people. And then it's like, I feel bad for me because I'm the end, like, receiving that, but then I also really feel bad because I feel like there are so many (inaudible at 00:38:56) that they can't pull their head out of their ass for lack of a better term. And I don't know, just — I don't know, and then I feel like they're both kind of like — or I can be like them in the sense where, like, if you don't hear anything everything may be fine, or like, as long as I, like, seem happy that, you know, I'm happy and they don't have to deal with any problems that may have happened in the past. [00:39:25]</p> Right.</p> Right. Yeah.</p> Um-hmm. Yeah, and then — yeah, I just feel really bad because yeah, I guess my needs weren't met and I don't know. And then I feel like I shouldn't have the right to be upset with them because they did the best they could. But I feel like, like with my dad, like, he's not humble about it and maybe that's the best way to explain it. He doesn't — I don't know. Like, any — like, we had, like, a huge falling out on my birthday, like, I think it was my 26<sup>th</sup> birthday. And basically, I ended up telling him what I needed and then he just got real angry and somehow it was turned around on me. And then it was just basically, don't ever tell me or talk to me when you're upset again because I don't want to hear about it. So that was very upsetting and then (inaudible at 00:45:32) know where I was going with this, but there's just like this, like, so I know that he did the best that he could, but I feel like things — like, we're both two adults now. We should be able to converse and if I — I don't know, he just doesn't care what anyone else feels and that bothers me. [00:45:50]</p> Sure.</p> Sure.</p> See you tomorrow.</p>",1
1004528631.txt,"Thanks.</p> I'm doing okay. Just a little bit – I don't know 'cause it's like – I had some friends (inaudible at 00:00:13) it wasn't that brainwashy. Though there were some – definitely times that like – 'cause let's go by [inaudible] since we're nice. There were some people on the trip – I mean no one was mean, but there are some points where some people said some things that like made me feel really uncomfortable. Just like talking about how clearly everyone believes that Obama is a putz, or stuff like that, or someone who had then actually said back because the one person was actually like ""No, I actually like Obama,"" and having one (inaudible at 00:00:46), and blah, blah, blah. And he stands up for the whatever, and then she like – the other woman was like oh, well. She went – I guess she was like – 'cause she – I guess – and she was talking about Sandra Fluke, but was like oh, yeah, there's no – she's all worried about her contraceptions, but no one is going to touch her precious uterus, blah, blah, blah, blah. Just like (inaudible at [00:01:09). Not everyone's a Republican. Not everyone's a Republican. You're wrong. They didn't speak up or anything. They were just like – stop assuming that everyone's a Republican.</p> Yeah. Well, just why wouldn't I try to like – if I'm complaining about Republicans, I try to do it in a context so that other people who'd agree with me and not like around people who are Republicans. Granted I don't know that. No, but I do. I guess – I mean more of an (inaudible at 00:01:45), but I wasn't like.</p> Then I just try to shy away from it. Yeah.</p> Yeah. And it's just – they're sad. Also, like I was getting my family – I don't know that I can do another family vacation without outside support. It was – having my own room definitely helped because then I had privacy I could go back to but... the problem with grandma and her declining is it's just that I have no patience for her. And I feel bad that I have no patience for her, but she is losing her memory and she'll – for example, she was going to – she went up to the bathroom, and she had left her purse with dad, and then she sort of started freaking out. Actually, I think even then, one time mom asked dad, ""Oh, is she going to remember that you have her purse?"" And dad's like, ""Yeah."" Except that then grandma didn't remember that dad had her purse and was freaking out where's her purse – ""Where's my purse?"" and we have to be like, ""Grandma, dad – you gave it to dad to take it. He has it. It's right here,"" or – which why in the future, I was like, ""Don't offer to take her purse. It's just going to make things worse because she's going to forget where it is."" Or like asking the same questions over and over again and stuff. And I just – I don't know. [00:03:26]</p> In general? Well, I guess I wouldn't have patience for anyone asking the same question over and over again. The problem is I feel like I should have patience for her because she at least has an excuse that she's lost her short-term memory. Whereas, with my dad, well, he'll ask a question and then he'll ask it again. He hasn't lost his short-term memory. He just doesn't listen to the answer. I'm like why should I even answer your question if you're not going to listen to it anyways? What's the point? Which is why I stopped – after a point, I stopped answering my dad's questions 'cause I'm just like no. You're going to ask it again. Whereas, normal people asking me a question – I guess 'cause sometimes someone – I ask a question and I do forget the answer, I will preface it like that, ""I'm not sure whether or not I've asked this already, and if I did, I apologize."" [00:04:20]</p> Yeah. And I usually try to listen when people give me answers. And usually I don't forget. Not much but... Yeah, it was just like I don't know, being around, and then there's a certain point... But I actually did then talk to my mom about it because there were two things. One was she – there was this woman on the trip who was a doctor, and I guess she and my mom had sat with each other at the same table for a few meals and whatever. And then, she asked me about my hands and stuff. And then my mom started explaining and being like oh, you know, surgery, blah, blah, blah, etc., and she can knit and play a guitar and stuff like that, and I was feeling oh God, like I'm the disabled kid who can knit. Isn't that so amazing? But the way my mom meant it was more like isn't the surgery amazing, but it just came out wrong. And I was just like... [00:05:23]</p> Well, I was participating a little, but I was there, she asked me, and then my mom started talking. She asked me. Granted like – okay, fine, I didn't know that it was considered – the term for it is a club hand. Considering that it's not like I was ever – it was never referred to like that then. And people are talking about my hands so there's a reason I didn't know the term. But – and okay – also, I was like below the age of four when these surgeries happened. But then again – I know what they did to my hands. I just wasn't aware of what age I was or what order these surgeries were in. But... yeah, I was there.</p> Uncomfortable and sort of dehumanized.</p> I don't know 'cause I don't like being thought of as disabled and it just was like wow.</p> Yeah. So I did confront my mom about it like afterwards. But – which is when she explained (inaudible at 00:06:36) was the surgeries. I was like yeah, you put it the wrong way. And she said that she's never thought of me as disabled. And I'm like okay. Do I believe that? I don't know. And she said she's never stopped me from doing anything. Like just because you've never stopped me from doing anything isn't necessarily you being able to think of me as disabled. Like the two – like it could be that's the case, but that's not a proof. You know?</p> I didn't up until that moment. And then I did after that. [00:07:14]</p> I mean she probably doesn't – and I guess then she was telling me that there is I guess some odd woman who had – what did she mean – that had a son that had something. It's not similar to mine, but some sort of physical disability that – they put him in a special school or something like that, and my mom never did that for me 'cause she was like against that 'cause that has to – yeah, and like this kid had no mental disabilities. And it was just like yeah.</p> But – I just want to be thought of as a person and it just sometimes sucks then. It's like oh, this medical anomaly, it's so upsetting. My grandmother who is all like ""Oh, you've overcome so much with your hands."" I'm just like (inaudible at 00:08:18).</p> Not this trip. She said that on New Zealand. That was in fall 2008.</p> Yeah (whisper). And I couldn't tell grandma off because she was grandma. Even then, before she was losing her memory, I couldn't tell her off. And I was just like kind of pissed off at that though.</p> But with my grandmother, I mean her intent wasn't to hurt my feelings either, but it's more – it hurts that she thinks of me like that. You know? It's not like she said anything insulting, 'cause you could think of someone who had like lost an arm or whatever, and if you say to them wow, you must've overcome so much, you're not saying that as an insult to them either, but they might not want to be thought of that way either. But like – I couldn't – how is it overcoming something if I've never known anything different. That's just the way I am, and it just – I don't have any...</p> ... problems. Like most of my things that I can't do are because I'm too short, not because of my hands. Really, there's – the only things that I can't do are cartwheels and flex arm hang, and at this point in my life, I don't need to do either of those things so. [00:10:07]</p> Okay, maybe like...</p> Like you know, when everyone else is doing cartwheels and I wasn't and...</p> Yeah. And I guess I wasn't the only person, but it definitely looked – I'm definitely not the only person in the world who's never been able to do a cartwheel, but definitely some – it felt like everyone else in my class.</p> And I think maybe everyone else in my immediate class could and it wasn't like I noticed someone else. Someone else being like, ""Oh, I can't do cartwheels either. Let's like chill out on the side and not do cartwheels.""</p> Yeah.</p> No.</p> Yeah. I mean I guess there's some people who don't have a physical – any difference, but they just can't do it and haven't tried doing it. Those people do exist. It just – yeah, it felt like everyone else in the world could do cartwheels but me. And flex arm hanging, it was just – I always like – I mean why would I even bother with the stupid presidential physical fitness test? And you get up there and like drop down right away. I don't have the upper body strength for that and – at this point in my life, like most people my age probably don't have the upper body strength for that anymore, but... So yeah, these things are no longer necessary, but...</p> Yeah, but... [00:12:12]</p> I don't know. The other thing was like – another day, my mom had mentioned – as we were talking, and she asked if it would help – she thought – noticed that I'd gained weight and was not happy about that and offered me like, would it help if I gave you an incentive if you lost weight, you could have $1,500.00 for a new wardrobe? And I'm just like well, that's way more money than I'd ever spend on clothing. It seems kind of frivolous enough. B, if I need new clothing for work, that will be because I'd have a job and then I wouldn't feel guilty about spending money on it. And C, no. Like the only reason I want – if I want to be losing weight is because I want to lose weight. I don't want it to be for any other – outside incentives if anything make things worse, but then that set me off because I'm like oh, that means like my mom just said I was fat. And I'd much rather have a good body image and be okay with my weight the way it is than to lose weight. And because of my mom is like ""Oh, well. I've always had a weight problem,"" like, ""I don't want you to go through this same thing,"" and I'm just like well, it's more of a problem if I'm not happy with my weight than it is to be overweight is, but she – 'cause like okay, so I haven't been walking as much as I should. And I need to get back into walking, but that's not me needing to lose weight. That's me needing to get exercise and the two aren't the same thing. And I really don't want to be dieting 'cause I'm afraid to, it doesn't work, and so like... And I even said to my mom I'm like actually, yeah, there was a point where I did lose 10 pounds, and that was when Jonas broke up with me and I stopped eating. That wasn't good either. [00:14:01]</p> Yeah. So I think it's more healthy to exercise more and...</p> Yeah, and it's not like I'm going out and eating like crazy things all the time and stuff like that or overeating tons.</p> I was eating out a lot more.</p> True.</p> True. I thought portion size is the...</p> So now Sydney wants to lose weight, so he thinks that then we should go out to eat less, which would solve that.</p> I did talk to my parents about a budget, and my mom said that – asked me how much I'd need, and I asked if like $200 a month spending money. Like that isn't – rent or something would be reasonable, and she said definitely, so...</p> Which is more than I – which – would ever be spending to go to restaurants if I wanted like at the highest number rather than the low number. So now, I don't have to feel guilty about paying for going out to eat.</p> Yeah. [00:15:12]</p> But I don't know. And I'm still like worried about the whole trial (ph) thing and stuff. And I actually today turned down a position, despite being worried about the job thing 'cause it was this thing I applied for way back, a document conservator contractor position. And it didn't say – I was like okay, contractor. It might be temporary, but like the ad number said that this is a temporary position lasting x many months and it also didn't mention a salary. And so then what I found out about the position: (a) all you're doing is scanning documents, (b) it's all up in Westford through repositories there and they're trying to get a specific collection, so that would be an hour drive each way, and then also – and it's a production-based thing, like getting x many scans, which it just seems like arbitrary for archives to like... it's an arbitrary deadline. It's not like they need that many for the specific goal other than they want to make things bigger. So it's just like – but it's a approximately six-month position that if you get the work done sooner, then it's less than a six-month position. So it would actually give people – the – the – the documenting – like I think that would give people motivation to like just scan bare minimum with maybe a little bit more to look better than doing bare minimum. It would just stretch it out longer. But I realize – and it was also $13.50 an hour, which wasn't going to be enough to support having a car and drive an hour each way five days a week. So I decided – and it was just going to be like scanning things and that's it. So grunt work, so I mean I guess maybe the pay is fair for what you'd be doing, but like... [00:16:58]</p> I don't need my degree to do that, and it seems kind of mind numbing and stuff. Like I'm okay with scanning things if it's like part of my job.</p> Yeah.</p> And I'd rather be like going through and finding things in collections and then scanning them or whatever... or I thought that it was like you could go to different repositories or something like that, and then I could like find ones that were closer. But it just – whatever, this specific collection – yeah, and the six months. So the combination of these things, though I would have been getting healthcare, but...</p> Which I have that right now until August anyways. But yeah, so I decided that like – and with Passover coming up too. But now I have to – I'm like oh, no. Now I have to go back and start applying for real things. Why does it sound like all the things that are listed are temporary positions? Yeah. So yeah, it just seemed kind of ridiculous. Like I think I made the right decision, especially if I've turned down other job that paid more and was less monotonous than this and had slightly less of a communal death.</p> Yeah, if it were like less of a commute and better paying and not interesting, I could do it. But like I can't have all these – like the combination makes it too much. If it were like – I don't know, even if it was closer. If it were closer and more interesting, I could do something for lower pay... or closer. [00:18:42]</p> I think I need actually two of those three variables. But yeah, like especially then because it is specifically 40 hours a week. And that would make things a little bit difficult with getting back in time for Shabbat. And...</p> Yeah, that – it just. Forty hour – what's something that's that fast paced and like get – must get this stuff done, so it's not like 40 hours a week and something laid back? Whereas, like normal archive will work working in an archive. Like it isn't production based and stuff, so you can – yes, you want to get through the backlog and process the collections, but it isn't like a super rush to process all the collections, so it's not the same thing and it's more interesting.</p> Yeah, I just haven't had any motivation. I've been—I – looked through the job log like week of postings and didn't really see anything on my first pass, but I could go back to looking. And also, I need to check like the other sites and stuff. But it didn't see – like I guess I should like also find the ones that are more a little bit more out. Like in the library and not our Catskills (ph) because at least there, something I'm also qualified to do, but... yeah, it's – so I haven't been doing that much, and I didn't really do anything while I was in Israel.</p> Well, I do also have to move all my stuff from one room to the other, and I kind of want to do that before I apply to jobs. I mean not that I can't do both, and it shouldn't take more than a day, but it just seems like this big ominous thing hanging over me, and I need to get that done first before applying to jobs, and it's – but hey, like yesterday, I did neither of these things.</p> Well, in the morning, I was volunteering. And then I was waiting around for that phone call where I learned about the position and that it wasn't what I was looking for... But then the rest of the time – I was like – was hanging out with Sydney, and we were watching these (inaudible at 00:21:34) and going out for dinner and stuff like that, 'cause he wasn't – 'cause he wanted to hang out and I wanted to hang out, so... I don't know why I couldn't. [00:21:45]</p> Maybe. Though then we ended up going to his place, so – in the evening, so I couldn't move stuff while I was there.</p> But we could. And then I guess yeah – like I'm planning – staying that Sunday is going to be the day that I move everything and... Saturday night, Sydney has a – his RPG, so he'll be over there. And in theory, I could go and like watch them and stuff, which might be interesting, or I could start moving all the non-furniture things, which might be a better idea. Then I'll feel better about it and then it will just be...</p> And I can't real – well, I mean I did a little bit of starting in that I've moved my things from my closet to the other closet, but... not things from my room because my closet isn't in my room.</p> My current room. My current closet. My new room has a closet inside it. But... [00:22:48]</p> Oh, technically. Well...</p> Super technic – I mean I'm not creating anything, I am – the things I'm moving aren't yarn and not technically supposed to be like moved – played – like you touching or moving things like yarn that have no Shabbat use. However, I usually ignore that rule anyways.</p> Yeah.</p> So I could...</p> And like the shelves, I – I sort of... Getting the shelves out will be annoying and stuff though. I guess I could start moving my random like things that I have around. Like I could do some of that on Shabbat and... [00:23:47]</p> For a while.</p> Yeah. And I can't really do anything about it this afternoon because after this, I'm going home and then I'm cooking Shabbat dinner.</p> Yeah. Well, now Shabbat starts at like 6:30, or maybe even 6:40 this week, so it's starting later. It's just that...</p> Yeah. And it's more important that there's Shabbat dinner because dad has a lot of people. And it's not just affecting me.</p> And I mean Sydney also has to write cover letters too. And he was like, ""Yeah, now we can go out and help each other write cover letters."" And I was like, ""Yes, so we need to actually do that though."" So...</p> Yeah and... I guess – I don't know, like if there are a bunch of different things around, should I apply to the newest ones first or the older ones that are like going away or...</p> Yeah. I don't know. And I guess it depends on how far – well, I guess if it's still posted then like it's presumably open whether or not it actually is open is?</p> That would make sense.</p> Yeah. And I think if I stop having all these things hanging over my head, it will be easier.</p> Yeah. That and Passover is coming up and now it's like oh, and I have all the Passover things to do as well. So Sydney is like excited about Passover and wants to help us with the process of koshering the kitchens and stuff since, you know, it's a learning experience for him. And he's not koshering his kitchen because even if he is like going to be keeping Passover, his housemates aren't, so he's keeping Passover in not eating things full of chametz, but he's not like using separate dishes or anything like that.</p> I mean this is the first year that he'd be observing it because he's converting so... This isn't a – what he typ – there is no what he typically does. This is like... [00:27:47]</p> Oh, okay.</p> Yes, he is converting to Judaism, so he doesn't have a what – a regular what he's doing thing.</p> No.</p> This was something that's prior. Yeah. I don't think I could date someone who's – 'cause I could never ask someone to convert for me, but like he found me on eHarmony. I didn't find him 'cause he wasn't in my search 'cause he listed himself as other and very serious about it, and then in his profile, he like mentions that he's converting to Judaism. And like in his message to me, he also mentioned that he was converting to Judaism. So it was something already in the making, but yeah. But because he didn't list himself as Jewish, I didn't see him.</p> So yeah, he is converting. He is converting conservative.</p> But yeah, not because of me.</p> Yeah. And I get to use him as unpaid labor. [00:28:58]</p> But... not that I'm getting paid either. And he'll be eating at our place a lot, so he will be also benefitting (crosstalk) from this process, but...</p> Yeah. So... but still, it's like all these different things hanging over my head, and I can't really attack any of them right now because I have my – I have to make Shabbat dinner.</p> The Passover things are written down, though Aaron hasn't added them to the calendar yet. I don't think. But we like had a house meeting and we set different tasks. I'm going to have to re-look at that list 'cause it looks like I might have signed up for a lot more than other people, in which case I might ask to lift some of them off. But... well, I guess some of them are easy, fun ones and that's why I didn't feel bad about them. Like the whole searching for a chametz thing counts as an easy, fun task 'cause you take ten pieces of chametz and you hide them around, and then the other person finds them. That counts as fun and not work, but it is one of the things on the list 'cause it needs to be done. And then also, burning it the next morning is on the list too 'cause it's something that needs to be done. But it is... [00:30:17]</p> But it's kind of fun. So like those two, so I guess really it's – well, yes it is. So I guess my other tasks are cleaning both fridges or all three fridges for Passover.</p> Which Aimee I think is helping me with like the ones in the – the two that are in the dairy kitchen. And then, also – and me and her are on koshering the meat kitchen, but I think that's just really the stove and the stovetop because like the – doing the counters and stuff is a different task, so it's not that bad. It's just like using the... what's the name of that? The oven cleaner chemical thing in the bottle, whose name I cannot remember right now. But that and then like heating up the oven and heating up the burners. It's not like it's hard – the – the fridges are probably going to be the hardest, and I think the reason I picked them is well, for the dairy fridges, my task is fridge clean anyways, so it's just a more thorough one. But if it is going to be way more than other people, it might be worth my while to ask if I can get rid of one of those or have Sydney help me with them. But I can't really start on any of those yet anyways. [00:31:43]</p> Yeah, so that's something over me, and I mean I don't have it written down. I need to move, but I need to move, but I don't have it written down. I need to write cover letters, but it – those are like – okay, so moving now I can break it down to different – different tasks, but as of now, it's one task, so it didn't break down because it's obvious and the same with the cover letters.</p> Yeah. And I mean the other thing is not knowing how long these tasks will take. And like last time, it didn't take that long to move me to my current room, but a lot of my things were still in boxes 'cause like I knew I wasn't staying in the other room at the beginning, and it was like I was there until the other side of the house opened up. And the other thing is also like I want to paint a mural on the new wall since I am leaving my room that currently has to be redone and painted. It would be a different mural. And – I mean at least it's not going to be full, all the walls mural like the other one is 'cause like the base color is pink and it's fine as opposed to like the ugly wood. Fake wood. Not wood. Fake wood paneling. If it were a real wood paneling, that would've been really awesome, but it was fake wood, and really, really ugly, needed to be painted over with something. And so I was like I might as well do a burnt mural. Also, there are more – there's much more wall space since it's a bigger room. But I'm just going to paint some things onto the wall, but it's like I can't actually – like I need to do that after I move and not before I move because I don't have the time to just do it before I move. And also, I don't have the paint for it right now. But I'm sort of afraid that if I do this, then I'll never actually do it... 'cause I'll just like oh, but I want my room to be unpacked and everything to be... so I don't really know what to do about that. [00:34:37]</p> Kind of. It isn't really specified though because we don't have someone moving in...</p> It's just – well, I mean I guess I need to get the furniture out too so that Aaron can schedule the appointment to have the floors in my old room be redone because they're sad linoleum. And when he redid the other floors in that apartment, I didn't have another place to be, so I was like you know what, I'm fine with my floors. And now we actually have the room free that we can fix it. So like my furniture needs to be out soonish, but it's not like...</p> But now I'm going to – then I'll be like regretting the fact that I never got to paint the walls.</p> Because there will be all this stuff in the way 'cause I have stuff.</p> Not on a weekend, because Shabbat would make it so I'd only have one day on the weekend. But... I guess not. I'm not sure. It's hard – the other thing is it's hard to visualize my stuff in the other space. Like I'm having trouble doing it. [00:36:05]</p> Except that I'm sort of afraid that then I'll just get lazy and never do it. And that would be sad about never even doing it, but not sad enough that I actually do it. And I don't want that to happen. But there's really no way of preventing that at this point.</p> Just move? But then what about my mural? I'll like...</p> Those are problems of not knowing... not knowing how my stuff is going to look in that room. Not knowing whether or not I have the wall space to do it. [00:37:23]</p> And I won't know until I have the stuff in my room, which is why I wish that I could just paint it all before I get my stuff in the room, but... The other thing is also I have to be careful with this one. With the other one, I could just paint whatever because my floor was a crappy floor. But here I have to like have drop cloths underneath and everything to make sure I don't get paint on the nice wood paneled floors that are real wood and not fake wood. They were new floors that Aaron got put in, so I – it would be really bad if I damaged them. It just seems like it's going to be a lot of fiddliness to work around things and... tape and all that.</p> Yeah. So this is why I just seem so overwhelmed because there's all of these little bits and pieces that... If we just get stuff from point A to point B, it wouldn't be as bad. You know, and then I'm thinking I want a new desk because the current yarn desk that I have is going to go to the person who will live in my room, my old room. But my real – the desk that belongs to me is currently in the beit midrash. It is like this huge flat thingy, which was fine when I was like in the old place, but I feel like it takes up a lot of space. And it's also finding the beit midrash, and I'm okay with it staying there and like belonging to the beit midrash, but I want a desk that's smaller and has more storage space, and it's a just like flat table thing. So I'm having to get that, but... at least I have really – Sydney has lots of free time so he probably could just go to Why-uh-key-uh (ph) and get a desk, assuming we could fit it into his car. But... because he has a compact car. Not like tiny, tiny, but, you know, it isn't like a station wagon or a minivan so... and not even knowing what furniture is going to be in my room makes it scary. [00:39:31]</p> Well, the problem is I don't know that much. And there's another dresser that could come into it too that's at my parents' place that they say I could have. But I didn't really get a chance to look at it since – when I was there over Shabbat and when I came back from Israel 'cause when I came back from Israel, I was all stressed out about having to get back so like I wasn't in a position to look at the dresser. And so I can't imagine it because I didn't look at it. And that affects other things because it's like if I have that dresser, you know, I might not take another smaller dresser, so really it's... and I don't know when I'm getting that dresser. So I can't even move in all my furniture because I don't know what all my furniture is. I can move my bed.</p> Yeah. And I can move all the things in my yarn closet to the new yarn closet. [00:41:40]</p> Like...</p> I'm not even sure how I'm going to see everything because – I mean of daylight, but like – we don't – there's no overhead light in the room.</p> I mean there's some desk lamps, but like then, I have to plug them in, but where am I going to plug them in when I'm moving furniture? If there just were an overhead light I...</p> Yeah. I already know that, but I need outlets. Who designed this – why would someone design a room without like an overhead light? That makes no sense at all. [00:43:03]</p> It was (laughter), but the other rooms do have overhead lights. And this one just doesn't. And I just don't... I can't comprehend it. Like I don't know why they never did it. There was this lamp that was on the side, but now it's – I guess Joan took it down and like, yeah, right now there are noth – there is no light that is plugged in there.</p> It's just that having all these little... those pieces when I'm moving as opposed to something overhead that like just stays there.</p> I mean...</p> ...maybe I should because it's a – it's something that needs to be done. I need to ask Aaron about it, but... because he'd be paying for it because it's his house, but... Actually, I do want an electrician to come in and put in an overhead light. I mean the other option is seeing if there are track lights that can have a plug and not be, you know, electrically wired. Like not wired behind the scenes and stuff, but just like having it running. It's just like – you can't even just turn all the lights off and – on and off with a switch. Like that alone is just annoying. I know (inaudible at 00:44:32) moving, you know, and I could always.</p> Maybe. Maybe I just shouldn't be doing this move because now I – like they give me – it's a lot of trouble for not that much gain.</p> Yeah. Well, and like I thought I did...</p> ... and because like in my room currently, there is all this random stuff on the floor because I don't have space to put it in because I don't have space for more dressers and stuff. So like...</p> I just wish I could be moving into a room that like I had the time to paint the mural on ahead of time and had ceiling lights and outlets. I mean a lot of the rooms in the house don't have that many, and so like, you know, you need the power strips and stuff, but typically (crosstalk).</p> Yeah. A little bit less common to not have an overhead light.</p> And the problem – it's too late for me. Like I already decided this. I think it's too late.</p> I don't, but Aaron wants to do the floors and stuff, but – like I needed to make that decision weeks ago. [00:46:32]</p> And that's not like it's the work that we did in Joan's room to get it ready to move into was something that wouldn't be helpful for someone else moving in either. You know, she like left all this crap in her room that we then had to get rid of, and so, you know, and she left all this furniture that we had to get rid of, and she – and also, there were like icky things stuck to the floor, which we had to like mop and clean and stuff. That needed to be done no matter what, so the only unnecessary thing that we'll have done is to have moved my stuff from one closet to the other, but...</p> Yeah. But we also decided that the other reason for this was because of over ten, you know, living on the side of the house that I'd be moving to... and new person not used to being would be – be – it would be easier to find someone if they're moving to a room that they have space away from the baby. Even though the baby isn't that bad, and it's not like I need to constantly flee to my room or anything like that. But for someone to then come into this situation and like – it would take a lot I think 'cause most people my age, if they don't have kids, they're not like... [00:48:06]</p> Yeah.</p> So it's like going to be hard to find a person as is.</p> Yes.</p> Okay, 3:30.</p>",2
1004513658.txt,"I had a bunch of meltdowns. By the time you called me back on whatever day it was that I called you with the appointment, I actually had taken an anti-anxiety pill. But...</p> It did. Most of them - all but one of them had to do over something financial that led into the bigger oh my God I'm spending all this money and I don't have a job. And, you know, it's already one thing, okay like I'm getting having my rent and I pay groceries with my half. You know, it's like at most I spent $40 on all my groceries. It's probably less than that.</p> However we've been going out to eat a lot more than I'm used to because Sydney likes going out to eat a lot. Like we finalized it, we had like this sort of discussion last night that we really needed to happen and it finally did. And so, because he, in terms of who was paying and stuff he thought like he was paying all the time and I thought that I was paying all the time. Or not that I was paying all the time but it was just, you know, I realized that he likes going out more times than me, he is sort of little resentful that the fact that we usually had to go to more expensive places than he might be used to if there was going to be a place with something that I could eat and I was like we're going out way more times than I would be wanting to. If I'm paying for half of it then that's still way more than what I'm used to. [00:02:00]</p> And it's way less expensive than going out to eat.</p> Yes.</p> Exactly. And for him it's more like a need. And I guess for the other part of it was like need - so like he has enough money for whatever and - like, when he was in, when he was growing up, they hardly ever went out to eat, whereas when I was growing up we went out every Sunday night. So [it was always a scene or a] (ph) fight about where we were going for dinner but then - but he hardly ever went out. And then when he went to college he went out a lot more. And even though this money was in his college fund and way more than he needed, and his parents weren't giving him any additional money, did not need to spend anything on him at all - like his mom tried to guilt him like all the time for the fact that he was going out to eat on a regular basis and throwing away money. So it sort of triggered that for him too but I didn't know that until last night because I thought it was normal like my family went out once a week and it was like if it's money that they don't have to help you with, then why are they guilting you? [00:04:16]</p> If he's going to go out with me and then if I have to cover it more than I'm comfortable with then I am throwing away my parent's hard earned money. You know, and if I had a job, I would be a lot more fine with it because then I could make a budget and be like okay I have like $500 a month for food, which is a lot. But if I had a job that like paid...</p> It was my decision and then it would be a budget that I could actually fund. And right now, because Sydney is like you going to have to budget and this should be [t-scripted and valued] (ph) and then prescripted. And I'm like okay well if I do that, you know, my expenses are way more than my income. That's not actually going to help me feel calm at all. I can't think of - I can't justify having a $500 a month budget for food. It's insane for me. If I were going out for ice cream or coffee on a regular basis. But, you know, an ice cream cone, even if I'm getting you something expensive at a nice place it's like, for myself it's just...</p> Yes, I feel like $6.</p> Well going out for dessert instead of a meal wouldn't be enough for him, though he doesn't usually go out for desserts. But we agreed to go out last night. I was okay with once a week but he wasn't. He wanted to do more than - but I think he would be okay with twice a week. [00:06:10]</p> Yes, and then I mean I'm paying to go out to eat once a week which is like - I know. I'm like, you know, it's not like oh no what we get to other events on the weekend? Like could we do that multiple times a weekend? I'm like if you're going out to lunch multiple times a weekend that actually is impossible for me because one of those days is Saturday. You go out with your friends on Saturday, I'm not coming along with Ashley. But like this Sunday I'm like if you're going to - because the other thing is because he has this tension with his roommates, it isn't a safe space for him to hang out with his friends, whereas -</p> Yes. I hang out with my friends, I have them to my place or go to their place or something. I'm not going out with them to restaurants.</p> So, I said if you want to do that, I don't really want to be paying for when it's something you do and I don't do. And he's like oh I didn't expect for you to pay for that. I'm like good because I would not want to - that seems kind of - like I understand why he does it. It's not something I could do. If I were to get together with my friends in some sort of mutual place it would be for ice cream and not for lunch. I would eat lunch at home and have my very inexpensive meal/meal I've already paid for, and go out for dessert.</p> Yes, it still...</p> Yes. Only this time I wasn't having a meltdown but like, the previous meltdowns were all like - and one of them was like something so simple as I had, I am working on the biggest upgrade now. The nice set that I got at [inaudible at 00:08:15]. I got these double blended needles and they came in a set of six different sizes and each size has six different needles. If you're working on a double blended needle project you usually use either four or five. I usually use five. So they give you that extra needle in case you break one. [00:08:41]</p> It's because I made a mistake that cost me money that I -</p> - consider myself having, considering that I'm also very [inaudible at 00:10:46] about going out to eat that I shouldn't be spending either.</p> Yes. So - and I know this so I haven't even decided what to do. Sydney is like oh well, you can order the new ones. I'm like well none of the stores around here sell them. Like they're available in one of two places. One is the online place that I bought these from and the other one is in another town, which is the yarn store in Providence and if we were to go there then I wouldn't have to pay for shipping but...</p> Way, way, way more money on gas. So that would be a stupid idea. And it would also be a waste of a trip to Providence to only get these needles. So...</p> I haven't tried - when I tried customer service when I was having my meltdown, they were like please hang up and try again. We're all full. So there wasn't even a queue system.</p> And I haven't tried them since. And that was Tuesday.</p> Spending their money on the needles they probably wouldn't care that much because they're $8 for the set of needles plus whatever $5 shipping. I don't know how they feel about if I'm like paying multiple times a week to go out to eat like how they would feel about that. I think to them - you know if I'm paying to go out to eat once a week that's fine. That's something that they always did when we were growing up but I think we were doing two to three times a week, if they knew, which they don't - they have access to my accounts but usually what I'm doing is I end up paying cash anyways. But I don't know I think they would not think it was a good idea and why would you be spending all that money that you don't have to be spending when you don't have a job? Because it's not a trivial amount. For Sydney it kind of is.</p> They know how much they pay for rent. We never talked about discretionary funds.</p> I'm just afraid that their discretionary flex budget would be like okay on your money how are your little [inaudible at 00:14:14], you shouldn't be spending more than that on like-item things.</p> They're happy to support me with rent and items related to my healthcare and food, but I'm pretty sure it's food within reason and I'm pretty sure this goes beyond within reason.</p> Yes. Than just like maybe you need to eat. So I don't know. I could ask them. I mean I see them like -</p> Yes, so...</p> Oh yes, they do. Actually that helped. Like we went out [inaudible at 00:15:02] for my birthday like the night before my birthday, and that put...</p> We're already boyfriend and girlfriend. He doesn't need to impress me and it's not really impressive when I have to pay half the time and I pay way more than I would ever think of paying for food ever. And it is important to him but its' not important to me. I want him to be happy but it shouldn't have to be at the expense of my non-earned - like if we went out to eat and it were $40 and I would pay for it, if I'm paying out of the money I'm earning for [inaudible at 00:16:01], that's four hours of [inaudible at 00:16:05]. I mean when I not sick of missing all the dates like I [inaudible] five hours a week, that doesn't - if I'm doing this once a week I'm going over the amount that I'm making. [00:16:26]</p> I can't imagine that they would be okay with daylight spending. To say less expensive places, even if I was paying to go out to eat twice a week that might get up to $400 a month of discretionary funds.</p> Way too much. If I had a job, it would be fine. But I don't so that is way too much for me and twice as much as I'd be making with my regular month [inaudible] schedule. So that's $200 a month of their money that I'd be spending. Especially because you know my parents right now - like my dad had a stroke and my mom's working at the store but not full time and so she's still collecting the difference in unemployment money that she was, between what she was getting from unemployment and what she was making at Bass. So she's getting what? She said it was $500 a week. So I guess that's like $25,000 a year with between Bass and unemployment, which is not a lot. Actually more like $28,000, do the math with me instead of my moms.</p> The two are related and I've felt like a failure for breaking, not breaking the little needle but ordering the wrong size when I could have prevented it and now I have to pay extra money for this mistake. So it's I don't have a job and the last month I have not done anything towards looking for a job or at least in the way of anything more than reading job ads. I have not written a single cover letter while I've been sick. And this week it was all packing for Israel and originally panicking about the fact that I had to move my stuff from one room to the other before I went to Israel. And then I talked to Aaron yesterday and he was - because no one's coming in on - like they want to redo the floors in my room since when we redid the floors on that side of the house we didn't do my room because it wasn't like I really had somewhere else that I could move my stuff to and I really didn't want to move my stuff out and move it back. [00:22:07]</p> All this craziness and...</p> No I'm not feeling like a failure for breaking the needles. I'm feeling like a failure for ordering the incorrect needles when I could've double-checked it.</p> It was a mistake that I didn't need to make.</p> How does...</p> Yes when it's an expensive mistake that I didn't need to make and also I don't have a job either.</p> Well I haven't done anything about it yet, so I don't...</p> Yes.</p> Okay, well if I still like [inaudible at 00:27:33], even if I get to the point of sending out three cover letters a week again, I still think I'm - like until I have a job I'm still going to have all that guilt. And I don't know how long that will take.</p> It might take -</p> - a long time. And at least like when Kim, she graduated in August and as of now I think she's still looking for an archivist job and so she's at her not-so-well-paid-and-they-have-no-benefits-because-they-refuse-to-let-them-be-fulltime-workers tech job at [inaudible at 00:28:11] but she's still making enough to pay all her rent and stuff like that. So she has student loans and she has to deal with them and stuff but she's sort of stuck at her sucky job until she gets a better job. But at least her sucky job pays for what she's doing. Whereas my not-well-paid-at-all-but-well-paid-for-what-I'm-actually-doing-for-it job that I only have five hours a week of is fine - [00:28:45]</p> - but it's not enough to cover my expenses. And so if I'm doing this - and also once it -</p> Well not even August, I was going to jump ahead until May. Once it becomes May I won't even have that for a while because the kitchen closes down in the summer. So it's not even a full - it's not even a job that I have all year around. So, I think I can jump ahead until May because that is something I know for a fact once the school year is over, there will be no [inaudible] until the Fall in September. So...</p> Not much yet. I mean, yes, there was the job at Joan's company that I did not take because I was like this would make me miserable. And that was probably the right decision. But that's something that - I don't know. It's something like that comes up again. Now I'm thinking because I've been feeling so guilty about not having, making money, maybe I should do that but then I wouldn't be volunteering or getting anything in my field. But what I really need is something out of the field that's half-time that I can still volunteer. But I don't know if that's something like - then I'd have to do two jobs searches that are jobs that I actually want and I job that I need to get while waiting for the job that I actually want.</p> Don't you think teaching is probably less like - and then the summer camp then would be offsite and then I'd be still paying rent and - I guess I'd be getting bored there but then I'd be not in New Haven for the summer. [00:32:00]</p> No. There aren't any summer camps in New Haven. I think there's Ramah in Conover but that's -</p> It's not something I can commute to. They also hold a lot of summer camps, I don't know if there's any Jewish day camps. I can look into that but Jewish summer camps -</p> Okay, well -</p> Yes, undoubtedly usually, like a lot of the academic jobs are all started in September and I'd rather work at something academic or non-profit than corporate anyway if I could help it.</p> I'm not sure what kind of things I could - and also, well I don't even know what kind of jobs or what kind of degrees they want you to have for summer camp. I feel the littler the kids probably the more professional you have to be. Like if you're taking care of babies, they're going to want people who have experience taking care of babies since babies are really, really fragile. [00:34:23]</p> I don't want to be in charge - I'd be fine being an activities teacher like art or whatever. I don't want to be in charge of the care of tons of small children.</p> [inaudible] But I don't feel like I'm doing anything. Like currently it's not like I'm doing anything useful or right or anything that is helpful in any way. Like okay I have these degrees. But that - okay so I'm smart but smart doesn't equal anything at all useful in terms of getting me a job right now. Like right now you don't need to be smart to have a job; you need to have the right education and apparently I don't have the right education. I have the right education for things I want to do, but in terms of things that are actually around and available not so much. So okay I have this talent that doesn't matter. And I'm good at knitting but what is that going to do? Absolutely nothing either. And anything I'm good at is not solving any of my current problems. So I think I have a right to feel like a failure because, you know, with all my talents it doesn't get me anything.</p> Accuracy and/or punishing myself because I think I deserve to be punished for -</p> It's not what I want but it's what I deserve and/or less capable of actual thought right now. Like, on Tuesday I was - there was a point where I was feeling like hurting myself. Obviously I knew that I wasn't going to do anything about it but I was feeling like hurting myself and I'm like, here I am. I'm like wasting all these resources of my parents and/or the universe if I'm not a productive member of society. And I am wasting society's resources by [inaudible at 00:38:33] like food and water and all that are limited, you know? And very much I'm wasting my parent's money. I'm 27 and they're still supporting me. [00:38:49]</p> Okay well feeling productive when I'm not being productive isn't going to get me anything either is it? I don't think so.</p> Not necessarily. Do you think that's bad?</p> The way I usually work, though right now I guess it's like being less so, when I make an expensive or whatever mistake usually when I freak about being an idiot because I lost my wallet and I need to cancel my credit cards, first I will go and make the phone calls to cancel my credit cards. Then I will freak out about being a failure because I lost my wallet again or something. Granted now this hasn't happened in four years or three years - it's been a while since I lost my wallet or my cell phone. [00:40:27]</p> It doesn't do anything. And my parents are like oh you should talk to so-and-so. But it's like so-and-so don't have contacts in my industries and stuff and my mom's like, oh, like such-and-such does like Nestle [inaudible at 00:41:56]. Like one of the guys lives out in [inaudible at 00:41:57] Bristol but he works in Manchester. I was like oh yes you should talk to him. You know, I'll mail him your resume and he has all these contacts. And he responded back and his response was like oh yes, look at my LinkedIn profile and feel free to ask me about any of those contacts. And I'm like okay that's not actually an answer, especially if they're like okay these random people. I'm not looking for a job. I would - if I'm looking for a job outside my field because if they're all outside my field I don't know which of them are working anywhere that's hiring and I'm being here to be like oh, can you ask these people for this? Like they all - it doesn't - it isn't really a helpful answer. Like I really don't want to have to go - [00:42:52]</p> Well if someone were like oh yes, I do know people at the such-and-such library and oh look they're looking for an archivist. That would be a helpful answer. Have I found that? No. I have not. It's really hard for me to try to do this thing that I am really, really uncomfortable with when it doesn't seem to be helping at all because I'm not networking with the right people. I'm networking with people - if I try to do this random networking that my parents are trying to tell me to do it with people who aren't in my industry and that's not going to help me because they're not in my industry and - yes. It all seems so stupid and stuff. [00:44:04]</p> Yes, every time I send out something and then I don't it makes me more convinced that whatever I'm doing is futile because I'm not doing - I'm not getting any results. If I were getting all these job interviews and I was not doing well then at least I'd know that my cover letters were good and I had to work on my interview skills. But because I've gotten a little feedback from people - they're not people who are hiring but my friends and they're like actually yes, that cover letter looks really something. And I'm like okay if it's something then why is it not working? Clearly there is something wrong with me. And, you know, being in contact with actual human beings - [00:46:07]</p> Yes.</p> It's about me that I chose this field.</p> I should've chose something I'm not interested in that was going to have - you know, I don't know if I would've been good at higher level math but I was very good at math in middle school or high school.</p> Not in math but maybe I could get an MBA or something. But then I'd be -</p> Not particularly.</p> No.</p> Well higher level math I guess would actually be useful I guess. I don't really know like technology computer stuff, which I also -</p> I wish like if there were more slightly related fields I could be branching out into, then I would think about doing something but I'm not really sure.</p> Yes, I guess at this point - you know, if I hadn't gotten the second Masters then I would still have money to get a second Masters and then I could - like if I was going to be second Masters in something useful but -</p> It might be eventually, but eventually isn't going to make me feel better now about spending all this money going out to eat that I shouldn't and I don't feel in control of that.</p> I'll convince others if you think that's going make it less so.</p> Well technically I can, you just don't want me to.</p> I can just beat myself up over this current degree. There's not like there was any class - like I only had one elective anyway and at the time it really made sense to take it because it was academic libraries and I was like oh I'd love to work in an academic library. It's just something I took the [inaudible at 00:50:09] online course that didn't teach me anything. But in general I didn't have much choice over my classes. So they could have done anything in that degree to have made it more mutual. Like maybe I could've - [00:50:27]</p> So I guess I will see you -</p> [inaudible at 00:51:41] taking the laptop with me but I will try my best not to spend time doing that when I can be out enjoying Israel.</p>",3
1004798837.txt,"I'm ready. It's been a really long week. The weekend felt like a year and then the week felt like two. I don't even know why. I think just because I'm busy or something. The weekend with all my plans and stuff, Friday night was fun, except that I got drunk and then was looking at Facebook on my phone. Franklin was writing stupid bullshit like—whatever—super deep about his life and direction—whatever. I was feeling like it was intentionally directed at me, and I'm sure it was to some extent and I got really angry. I didn't have my car and my friend's boyfriend was designated driver, and so he took us to get pizza and that was fine. Then Saturday, I don't even know what I did. I don't even remember what I did, probably errands. Saturday night I was going with my friend, Jillian, the one that I've recently become closer with again that I knew from a while back. She lives right behind where I work. It was her friend's birthday and her friend is somebody that I have met a couple of times, and so she invited me along. [00:01:21] Her friend has had problems with her boyfriend in the last six months or so, like caught him sending naked pictures to somebody and he came out that he was cheating. Blah, blah, blah. She stayed with him. He stayed at her house and she was trying to work it out. We're going to this birthday thing. She's getting a hotel room for her and her boyfriend for the weekend. We're supposed to go downtown. They have a nightclub; they have a VIP—whatever. Everything is fine. We're at the hotel and people are drinking and getting ready. Fine. We go to the club. Her boyfriend is kind of an asshole. We go to the club. I was miserable, meanwhile. The whole day I was miserable because I was missing Franklin. I hadn't talked to him. I was just feeling really sad and miserable. I just wanted to talk to him, but was feeling conflicted. So I was even miserable at this club and I'm not really a huge fan of clubs to begin with anymore. It's just a lot of . . . and my shoes were hurting me. It was a whole thing. [00:02:16] I was sitting there, minding my own business, I guess looking bored. But, whatever, I had my drink, and the boyfriend is sitting in the VIP section. He comes over to me, moves seats and drunkenly sits down next to me kind of brushing me. I was like, ""Okay."" He's like, ""You look as bored as I am."" I was like, ""I'm not bored. My feet are just hurting me, so I'm taking a break."" He was like, ""I'm really bored."" I was like, ""Where's the birthday girl?"" It was his girlfriend's 30th birthday. ""Where's the birthday girl?"" He was like, ""I don't know. Somewhere,"" and then he said, ""I have a foot fetish, so if it weren't inappropriate to offer to rub your feet, I would."" I was like, ""Well, it is. Maybe you wouldn't be so bored if you were dancing with your girlfriend,"" and walked away. It turned into a whole traumatic ending to the night because I guess he was drunk and kicked her co-worker out of the hotel room. We're in the hotel room because Jillian brought along her 21-year-old sister who, I guess, had too many shots or something and so she's throwing up in the toilet. Me and Jillian are trying to take care of her. The girl and her boyfriend are fighting, like ""fighting"" fighting. [00:03:20]</p> Rachel. Rachel and her boyfriend are fighting. Me and Jillian are trying to convince her to come with us. Finally, we leave. The sister is in the car throwing up like, ""Take me to a hospital. Just call mommy. I just want to talk to mommy."" Her sister, her little sister. We're like, ""You'll be fine."" It was just a dramatic thing and I had already been feeling shitty. [00:03:42] Anyway, the next day I called Franklin and was like, ""I miss you and I wanted to talk and everything,"" because he had sent me a message that he misses me earlier and blah, blah, blah. So then we talked and it got a little heated and turned into a whole you stopped talking to me without saying why and I felt abandoned. I was starting to feel things towards you that I didn't want to feel. I tried to explain that I just feel like trying to take a break, like I just felt like I needed a little space; and this and that. He was really upset and he was like, ""Well I don't want to do this anymore then, because it's just too hard."" I was like, ""Okay, again you're threatening to break up with me. You always do this."" We were talking about something and it was getting a little heated and I ended up saying, ""I feel like you bully me into thinking whatever I'm saying is wrong."" [00:04:36] He got really upset that I used the word ""bully"" or said it in the heat of the moment. I was like, ""Okay, I'm sorry, but I need to be able to tell you things without it getting to the point where I'm blurting it out."" As it turns out, he saw a therapist earlier in the week on Tuesday. He found some guy. His insurance company has a list and he found some guy and, I guess, he specializes in urban youth growing up in society dealing with the trauma of their childhood, growing up in ghetto situations or whatever. I guess that's what he specializes in, which is right up Franklin's alley, so that's good. He was saying how he liked the guy, but the guy had him start a journal and gives him assignments. It's weird though. He was like, ""The first session I had was an hour and fifteen minutes."" Then he went again last Friday and he said that session was an hour and forty-five minutes. [00:05:41]</p> I don't get it. I know. I've never heard that in my life. He was like, ""It's a $20 co-pay."" I was like, ""Alright, do your thing."" I was happy to hear that and I have to say this, for all his saying to me, ""What do you mean seeing if I'll do some of the things you wanted me to do by not talking to me?"" even though we had that discussion. He has a therapist. (laughs) I was happy about that. He said he would like to see a couple of therapists and he was feeling frustrated. He felt I wasn't holding up my end of the bargain in the sense of having made the decision together that we are going to try to work on things and see if we can make this work. I was like, ""It was because I wasn't really seeing as much as I had hoped in terms of things you were doing. [00:06:40] That made him upset, but fine. I would like to hold up my end of bargain, I just needed him to show me a little bit of enthusiasm. I haven't called the people that you gave me their names, but I plan to this weekend and see about that. So that's good. He was like, ""I want to give you your space, but I want to take you out on a date or something. I want to try to actually do this."" I was like, ""Okay,"" so I'll go out on a date with him. I think we might go out tonight or Sunday, but I still have the feelings like being unsure, obviously, and not really knowing. In our conversation he, too, finally for once instead of being like, ""I hate it when you say, 'What if we don't work out?'"" but finally for once he was like, ""If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, but if we're going to try, let's try."" Okay, I'm glad that you acknowledge that. [00:07:41] What bothers me is that I think I'm still thinking a lot about the thing with the girl and not sure how to really . . . yes, we can work on our communication stuff and our issues, but where does this whole thing fit in about the whole thing. (laughs) I feel confused like what it was and confused if he still has chummy relationships with girls and who they are and if this is what it is. I have a lot of issues with that. How do I know it won't happen again? And why in the first place? I still don't understand why. I guess I'm also fixated on what he really said to her? What was really the nature of their conversations about what was going on with them versus what was going on with me and him? I wish I knew. I'm not really sure what it would solve for me, but I guess it just feels like there was this whole thing that I was very directly involved in that I don't have any grasp on what actually happened, and that upsets me. [00:09:16] We tried to talk about it and it's just not been productive when we've tried to talk about it and he would like me to forgive even if I can't forget; but at least if I'm going to forgive, then move on. I'm still not sure if I do forgive 100 percent or if I will or if I'll be able to move past it. I'm not sure how to breach that subject with him because he gets very defensive and . . . defensive about it. I do feel better because I'm not talking to him right now because of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah; and I feel better that he's not being as much like, ""You're not talking to me as much as you used to,"" because he gets it, I think, a little bit more now. He is still acting a little bit like mentioning things about giving him access to do laundry because of blah, blah, blah, and his room and the bed is too small. Whatever. Even in our conversation, I hate the fact that I had to tell him for the 100th time, ""Please don't threaten to break up with me. It's not mature."" (chuckles) That's kind of what's going on, so why be like, ""Well then, I'm done. Just keep all of it."" He was like, ""Everything that's mine that's still there, just sell it or something."" [00:11:00] Okay, Franklin. Way to be the most dramatic person that I've ever met, like you're the girl in this situation right now. Right. Maybe that's something that the whole still thinking about the Betty situation and what-not is something that we can try to explore in couples therapy. I'm just nervous about how that's going to go and overall, if he's trustworthy. He really had been keeping things from me in terms of how he has relationships to people that I don't know, specifically women, obviously. (pause) [00:12:04] So many of my friends are like, ""No. Be done. You'll never trust him again. Why waste your time trying?"" but I don't think that's fair. I'm sure that's what my mom thinks, too, but we'll have to just deal with it, I guess. But, again, I'm concerned about the whole trust thing and how to manage that. (pause) The problem with not knowing how to talk about it with him, I also don't know how to stop thinking about it myself. [00:13:07]</p> I wish he understood how [bothersome] (ph) this is to me still and understood it and helped me work through it or something. Reassure me. He does reassure me that he would never do something like that again and that he only wants to be with me forever, blah, blah, blah; but I still feel like the whole incident is still shrouded in mystery for me. For him it's like why does it matter? Then I think, ""Well, you say that because it's worse than you've let on and you don't want to tell me the real truth,"" which is compounding lies with lies or even lies of omission. How am I supposed to deal with it? I don't know how to put those feelings away yet. At the same time, if I am going to try to forgive and try to move on, I don't want to be the type of person to do that and punish him forever by keep bringing it up or all of this stuff. It's just been such a consistent problem throughout our relationship that I don't really know how to not think that at one point or another there's going to be some sort of conversation with a woman that could get to an inappropriate point or could be something that he would know would make me uncomfortable if I saw it, so deletes it. [00:18:23] I feel like I'm struggling with that the most. The other stuff, I can work on more as long as he's willing to work on it we can try to talk about—like approaches to talking to each other. But this whole thing with my feelings, I can only work on that. I am asking, I am throwing the question out there angrily, like what do I do? Do I tell him we need to clear the air about the whole thing and go over all the bloody details? It sucks. (long pause) [00:21:02]</p> Unclear about what? In general? Maybe I just wasn't hearing. I don't think you're unclear. (pause) Is it too much to ask you to ""re-say"" it?</p> But like what bunch of things? I don't even know what he can do to show me. Are you thinking about follow through on things?</p> He did, but his account is totally self-centered.</p> Right. That's true. Thank you. The biggest thing is that he hasn't done it. </p> Right. Which is what I always do. That makes plenty of sense and I agree with you, but it doesn't make me feel better. </p> I feel like I also just need to give myself a little bit more time with things for now and see how things pan out. He is giving me space, which I appreciate. I want to kind of evaluate how much he's relying on me for opinions on things because he's already e-mailed me a couple of questions about like, ""Should I do this certification for my personal trainer or this one? Does this one look legit?"" Decisions that he should be, I think, already reached—first of all, already have researched. You're talking about this for six months already. Secondly, you should be relying on yourself for at this point. That's kind of part of this whole thing. That's kind of part of the point. I want to kind of evaluate how that goes, see about a couple of therapists and see how that—I don't know what I would even expect from that. So it's like I'll give it a go. [00:27:41] I am wondering what he's talking about with his therapist. He's like, ""I just told him everything in the first session. I just kind of gave him an overview of everything."" I'm like, ""Which everything?"" because there's a lot of everything. He said he told him about us and the whole situation. I'm like, ""What are you talking about for an hour and forty-five minutes? What is this assignment that he's giving you?</p> Of course. </p> No, no. It's fine. I guess I just need to give it a little more time and let things do what they're going to do for now. </p> No, no. I think it's more like I am almost feeling internal pressure to figure this out and move on in whatever direction it's going to be. [00:30:53]</p> Exactly. Right. Having friends and family that are leaning one way or another makes it difficult as well. I do have friends that are like, ""Whatever you want,"" but then I do have the friends that are like, ""Why are you even bothering?"" My idiot friend, Sandra, whose wedding I did, put a nice-looking candid picture of me and Franklin from her wedding up on Facebook and tags us the other day. I'm thinking, ""Sandra, you know what's going on with us? What the hell?"" But, yeah, the limbo is frustrating. [00:31:47]</p> Right. Right. I'm not finding myself wanting to go on any dates or meet any guys or anything. I'm just not very interested. It was a really long week. It was very busy at work just figuring out; now me and Franklin are talking, figuring that out. I went earlier this morning and got a haircut and was going to go to work and come here and then go back to work, but I just called in sick instead because I was like, ""Yeah, I can get a day off."" Even though I had Monday off for Rosh Hashanah and then I have next Wednesday off for Yom Kippur, for some reason this week was just Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday only were so long for some reason. I have schoolwork now. I have so much reading for school for one class, so much reading, so that's a lot making me tired, too, so I just decided I would take a day off. I have off to go out of town anyway, so that's at least good. I'm looking forward to resting some this weekend and just not being on the go as much as I was last weekend, I think. [00:33:25] I'm going out with friends again on Saturday because my friend is moving to do traveling program and, again, at the same club as last Saturday. I don't know what's so popular about this downtown club that everybody loves it, but that's where, apparently, she is also a VIP. I mean, we're 28 years old. We're really doing VIP nightclubs? VIP section? I don't know. I'm not part of that. Wait. So I was out on Friday night being drunk and angry and I ended up at this club with my friend, Mindy. Like I said, she's a club rat. We met her at a bar and she was like, ""Come to this place"", by the station. Apparently she knows everybody there. Her boyfriend works there or something. I don't freaking know. I was drunk and annoyed and my feet hurt and whatever. She was like, ""Come in this back room and sit down. Here is my friend, Kyle. He's really drunk. He's sitting here. Come sit with him and then we'll go in a little bit."" [00:34:29] (sniggers) So I sit down and she's like, ""Kyle—Trina. Trina—Kyle."" I'm like, ""Okay."" He's some big VIP club guy that's at all the clubs, like he's her best friend. I don't know. She has a weird life. I don't know. (sniggers) I'm sitting there looking in the other direction and I feel something on my hand and he has sprinkled some coke on my hand and I'm thinking, ""Where are we? What is that club, Club 64,"" or whatever it's called? The disco? Mike Myers? The movie? Studio 54. I was like, ""What is this?"" and I just brushed it off like, ""No, thanks. Mind asking me first?"" It was super-surreal because I was like, ""Where am I? What's going on?"" and it wasn't even a back room, like in the back. It was still part of the club. People were around. It was very strange. I didn't enjoy it. It made me feel very uncomfortable and I don't do cocaine. [00:35:23]</p> Yeah. Like, ""What are you doing? You're in public. Keep that shit to yourself,"" you know? Again, we're 28. You're bumping cocaine in the club at 2:00 AM? Okay. And she's a nurse, like NICU. (laughs) I know. What the fuck? So, yeah, that happened. Hopefully that won't happen again. I'm going with Lucy, the girl that I became friends with again. She's going with her husband because it's our childhood friend, Mindy, from kindergarten—best friends. She's going and she's normal, so that will be good. I'm bringing along my friend, Gussie (ph), who's not normal, but she doesn't do coke; so she'll be fine. I don't know. It's a club. It will be fun. I'm going to make the most of it. It's just funny. I'm going to the same club two weekends in a row. [00:36:20]</p> Probably not. Maybe a bar or a nice lounge or just some (laughs) [ ]. (inaudible at 00:36:27) That's my idea of a goodbye party or a birthday party, not popping bottles. But, no, I think as far as hanging out with people—no. I'd rather go somewhere that doesn't cost $20 to get in, but I think that's more why I'm like ""Ugh"" awful. So, no, I have enjoyed being out with friends and taking advantage of that sense of freedom. Making plans and not running it by him or make him feeling excluded. It's just like this is what I'm doing. These are my plans. It's hard because I'm trying to find a balance between schoolwork and weeknights and going out on weeknights and staying up late. I've been staying up a little too late, but I'll find the balance again. It's not like acting crazy. I haven't gone grocery shopping yet, which is totally unlike me, but I just haven't felt like cooking anything. It's just been so much easier (chuckles) to order out or go out. [00:37:46] I really like having my own finances. Did I tell you that my mom got a notification in the mail that she opened and it was for found wages? Like $500? I guess it was commission that I left before the end of the fiscal year, that they would have had the commission amount. So I have a $500 check coming to me.</p> Yeah, I know. But, yeah, I'm enjoying having my own finances. Yesterday I got so out-of-control frustrated when I was getting dressed for work because I realized I've been wearing the same work clothes during the winter, like the same pants and bullshit for like three or four years. I'm just like, ""I'm going to buy new work clothes. I know I don't have that much money, but this is ridiculous,"" so that will be something nice to do for myself I think; and that will feel good to start the year fresh like that. I was going to go to Columbus day weekend to visit Mandy because I found a ticket for $200, but I guess family is going to be in, so I'm just going to go to Chicago instead. Still, also going away, being able to make a plan to go to somewhere without him being like, ""I don't want to go. What about me?"" Like, ""No, I'm just going to see Mandy for a weekend."" That's exciting. [00:39:07] I wish I could afford a real vacation, (sniggers) but [ ]. (inaudible at 00:39:11) I am worried about all of this stuff. I do feel a lot better now that I'm not talking to Franklin, but I am enjoying the freedom. I did tell him that the other day when we were having this whole conversation. ""I like the feeling,"" and he's like, ""I feel like one should feel that way whether they're in a relationship or not."" I was like, ""Well, I wasn't, so I need to get that back."" He was like, ""Okay, true."" I think his feelings were a little bit hurt, but he took it like a man for once. (chuckles) (sighs) So, yeah, I'm enjoying that. [00:39:57]</p> Totally. It's a difficult and confusing time. A lot of people, if I've told them the situation, have told me how impressed they are with how I'm handling it and they're impressed that I stuck to my word about what I wanted to do and how I'm handling it.</p> So it's nice. And it's true, I think. I think I am handling this well (chuckles) considering. Ironically, at the club last week right when we were leaving and I was miserably sad, on the verge of tears, this friend of Franklin's who we've known since he was little—I guess their families grew up together—this girl, she was there at the bar and she was like, ""Listen."" Of course, drunk, has to start talking to me about it. Like, ""I talked to Franklin and he told me blah, blah, blah, and I just want to let you know how much he loves you and he'll do anything for you. I grew up with them and all of them—all these girls are always going to be around but it doesn't matter because he loves you."" I was like, ""You bitch. You don't know what the hell you're talking about right now. It's not the girls I'm worried about; it's him. Get out of my face. You don't know me."" (chuckles) I think he's been talking to her a lot more lately. I don't care, but I was like, ""Really? Right now?"" I had already been feeling miserable the whole night and then she has to come out defending him, basically. I'm like, ""Listen, honey. Please."" That was irritating. [00:41:57] And she's just really fake. She's just like, ""Oh, my God. I'm here for you. I'll call you tomorrow."" I'm like, ""I don't even know you. Go home,"" you know? So then I was like, ""Okay, what's he been talking to her about? What are they talking about all the time?"" I don't think she's after him, but I don't know—again, it's the whole attention-seeking thing. I don't really do that, I really don't. And he's still hasn't told his family. Nobody's talked to them. We haven't talked to them. I haven't talked to them, (sniggers) which there's nothing wrong with that. It's not my mom. I talk to my family. I don't really know what to tell them. I have relationships with them, but not to the point that I'm going to be calling them and he's not. It's weird. So he can work that out on his own.</p> Great, okay. So 11:55 next week? Okay. Cool. Have a great weekend.</p>",0
1003269452.txt,"Hi.</p> Good. How are you?</p> I'm good. Sorry about last week.</p> I actually had a visit from Ferñao. He came to visit Chicago.</p> Yeah, I tell you. But what happened is, I don't even remember what we talked… which is probably why I should write things down.</p> Yeah, but I mean like in terms of him. And him coming to Chicago and everything.</p> He didn't call…</p> Yeah. So basically the week that I think I saw you he was preparing all the stuff to be admitted into this program. It was a really confusing week. And then in the end, he was – on Thursday or Friday I think it was – he was looking at flights. And they were reasonably priced. And so he was like, 'I think I'll just come on Saturday.' It was so random. 'I found a flight. It's like 450, which is good because then in Euro it's even less. And, he was like, 'I'll bring the application and we can submit it at the school and then see what they say and have a better idea, because we're in person.'</p> Yeah. So we wound up …</p> In September. Well really September 28th, it begins.</p> But it is not a graduate program. It is a continuing education program. And it is just for English. Learning English.</p> …first. And the apply to graduate school. So we were looking for apartments for three days, all day. 10 apartments a day. It was a little bit difficult because he's foreign. So he doesn't have a social security number. He has no credit here. All these things that they usually …</p> They basically told him that he has to pay 12 months rent up front.</p> No. Because they don't have credit here.</p> And I have really bad credit. I have no money in the bank. [0:03:01]</p> Yeah. He's doing it. So that's – he can do it. Lucky for him. Whatever.</p> We found a place. Really nice.</p> The thing is, I thought about it, and she's never going to be there. And I'm probably going to end up working at the school where my mom works – like substitute teaching. Well I definitely am. And it is next door to the apartment. So I'll probably end up staying there more than she does. And it'll just work itself out, I think.</p> Yeah and she's (overlapping at 0:03:40). And she's probably going to stay with her boyfriend. So it will be fine.</p> Yeah. I don't know how you feel about Northwest.</p> It is kind of downtown, whatever. He doesn't care because he's … whatever. But the apartment's a penthouse. It is a small building. It is seven floors, but it is a penthouse. And it is a duplex apartment, one bedroom, with a balcony on the first floor, and a terrace that is amazing. It is so nice. It is really big. And it has access to this bigger terrace that is on the roof. It is really, really cool. It has a view of the Empire State Building on the water. That's big.</p> It is… it is 2500 a month.</p> For here, for Chicago I think that is a steal, actually. For a duplex with a terrace and that stuff. But this wound up being a problem too because… It is going to work out, but I don't know. This real estate agent got involved and you kind of didn't like her, but once you're with them you can't especially if you apply with them, you can't really – there's nothing you can do. You're just with them.</p> He's not still here. He went home on Sunday. But he's going to get it in the end, so it's fine. So that day we were supposed to meet, I completely forgot and we were really looking for apartments.</p> Well I don't know. It depends on your perspective.</p> I know. It was great having him here. It was just like, I don't know. It is a little stressful because every time – well when he was first here for three weeks just visiting in August it was just a lot of sight-seeing and running around and dah, dah, dah, dah. Whatever. And this time it was a lot of running around, looking for apartments, get the application together. So I'm looking forward to when he's here and it's not going to be constant craziness and chaos.</p> He – his family has a business. It is a real estate business. He works basically doing that. So he's leaving a family business. It is not the biggest deal.</p> Yeah I think he's really excited.</p> He's going to be here – well he has his appointment with the visa people on the 18th. And they say basically it takes seven days, more or less. So probably by the 25th, the 26th he'll be here. So it's good.</p> I know. It's crazy.</p> Yeah a lot. A lot.</p> Well the thing is…</p> I know. I'm happy about that actually. Well the thing is I wanted to tell you – so yesterday we had a little issue with the phone again. The thing is, I was working at my friends store again – I don't know if I told you…</p> Yeah. And it gets really boring there at a certain time. And I think it adds to the anxiety because I just want to get out of there anyway. But I did the worksheet, because …</p> Yeah. The think is, is it helped for sure. It wasn't like I was completely free of all anxiety and worry but it definitely did not reach the state that it reached the last time. It didn't reach that level.</p> I do. I think I do actually. I've give it to you. It is somewhere. In this nightmare.</p> Oh really? It's not. By the way, I bought this and I'm obsessed with it.</p> I really like it, it is really helpful.</p> Yeah I'm going to get more books once I finish it. But anyway so it helps. And also – I had a little spat with – two little spats with this… one when he had already got home on Monday. And one when he was here. They were little things. It is also still like we're getting, we're learning about each other still. I can't really recognize his annoyance face and his angry face and differentiate. But I think it has been helping me deal with those things too because I didn't get as crazy as I feel like I would have before. [0:09:04]</p> Again not perfect.</p> No I have it. Specifically…unless I left it there. Pretty embarrassing. (laughter)</p> He didn't call me. Psycho. I'll find it.</p> Yeah. He had to go somewhere, he was eating at a restaurant…</p> I knew it. And he said, 'I'll call you.' I said, 'Call me when you leave…'</p> I was really nervous. I had to fill out as much as possible.</p> Well the thing is, it is usually the strongest is always anxiety. But there is a little twinge of the other, so I just added them. It is not like severe anger, or whatever I put.</p> I think in my case it would almost always be anxiety.</p> With this specific situation?</p> The thoughts.</p> That …</p> Generally, that something is wrong. Something is really wrong. Specifically from that he's out with friends and he doesn't care about calling.</p> Yeah.</p> That he doesn't like me anymore.</p> Yeah.</p> It is a little bit more anger, I think. Probably anger.</p> Right. Then this is all worthless. Why am I doing all this work for his apartment, to help him, if he doesn't like… and it goes on and on and on.</p> Yeah.</p> Definitely the catastrophic…</p> That was the only thing that was a little bit less than the last times.</p> Exactly.</p> Clearly this sucks and I hate it. And I kind of, it is giving me anxiety, but it is not the end of the world. Even if the worst thing happens I'll survive. That was the one thing that was a little bit better this time.</p> Yeah it is definitely that.</p> Yeah. Yeah definitely.</p> Right. Exactly.</p> Yeah.</p> Of those two?</p> The thing is, when I read the book to – and they describe, I forget what they call it – universal self acceptance – or something.</p> (overlapping at 0:14:43) unconditional is the opposite of that. I recognize that I do that, but I don't see myself saying the words – 'I'm worthless. I'm a piece of shit.' Even though I know what I am saying is equal to that.</p> I don't know. Like, I'm not good enough basically. Something is wrong with me.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> That is why it is difficult for me to say, 'Well it is definitely the one that I'm worthless.' Because I think in a lot of ways I do feel I must feel that way about myself. Because after reading the book and seeing examples, I do do a lot of those things. But it is really difficult to say, 'Yeah it is because I think I'm worthless.' Do you know what I mean?</p> I think maybe that's it.</p> Because we talked about that last time too. That the way I feel about how other people feel about me and view me. I think it is more that. [0:16:05]</p> Right.</p> Which he doesn't even do. So it is even more irrational.</p> Yeah. It is that.</p> Yeah. [0:17:02]</p> Yeah. And I don't think the main one is depression.</p> Yeah.</p> I think that personally, generally speaking, my issues that I'd like to work on. I think the unconditional self-acceptance entire issue is one. But I think that this is a really big one, and could be implemented a lot just in everyday life. I'm sure I do things like that with other situations that maybe I don't even realize because they're not as extreme. [0:18:20]</p> Right. That is what I think.</p> Right. Exactly.</p> Right.</p> Right .</p> Exactly, yeah.</p> Exactly. That is the thing. I'm always worried about these things.</p> Right.</p> Right.</p> That is very illogical. Yeah.</p> Right. And I think that I got there. I definitely… I don't think that I wrote it, but I got there. I was like, 'Okay this is illogical.' I think that helps me out with the other thing I told you that helps.</p> It is meaningless. Yeah. [0:20:00]</p> Right.</p> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Please. I think that I actually have gotten better, because I have – I've Ferñao's voice in my head telling me that in certain situations in the past two weeks, I guess. And so I think I have gotten a little bit better about thinking about it. But maybe not perfect. Do you know what I mean? Maybe it is not coming up as quickly as it should, or maybe I'm not thinking about it as much as I should, but it has definitely entered my mind.</p> Right.</p> I think we're seeing some signs of that. (chuckling) I feel that too. When it doesn't happen it's like, but…but…, and I don't know how to function because I want it to happen the way I want it. I know that it can't be that way in life. [0:22:02]</p> Yeah I know. And I know that, but yet I still go get crazy.</p> Yeah. I think that – yeah I don't know why.</p> Or even, it will change. Nothing is going to happen.</p> Mm hmm.</p> I know. I've thought about that too.</p> No it's not.</p> Umm… well certainly if I'm not being obsessive and worrying over things. Because the truth is, it's obvious when I'm in that state, even if I don't tell people. You can see it all over my face. And he notices. And so if I'm not that way, and if I'm confident and mature.</p> No. Exactly. No. It is.</p> Yeah, of course.</p> No. Not like that.</p> I haven't.</p> Are they breathing things?</p> Oh yeah.</p> Here? [0:25:04]</p> I've done this before.</p> Yeah I've done this before, for sure.</p> I don't remember why it didn't. I don't think it was in therapy actually. I think it was something. But yeah it works. It is just training yourself to do these things when you're in that… Training yourself to do anything when you're so used to getting into this frenzied state of anxiety is very difficult.</p> Yes. And I did try to – well first of all I did the worksheet because I was like, 'Let me fill out something.'</p> Right. And then also I tried to read. And I did get into the book, which I was really surprised because at first I was reading it I was like, 'I'm still worrying, I'm still crazy, I'm (overlapping at 0:25:59)</p> And I was looking at the phone. But then, I got really into it that I didn't even notice when someone came into the store. So I feel like I can train myself.</p> Yes.</p> Yes. But that night, or I think it was yesterday, I did for five minutes find myself out of it. Which was good. I think. A good sign that it is possible to get out of it.</p> I don't know.</p> Yeah it is difficult. It is difficult to focus on something else for sure.</p> Yeah. It sucks.</p> No.</p> I know. And I think also the same thing about control, I do with a lot of other things. Even with Ferñao's situations. It is not even my situation, like his visa situation. Or his getting an apartment. It is for sure not as intense as the way I feel when it is a personal relationship, but it is still a little bit of anxiety. Like this isn't going to work out. What are we going to do? Then our relationship is not going to work out because he's not going to come here. And it is too much…</p> I don't know. I think it is like…</p> Yeah. It is also…</p> Yeah that. And I think it is also, if I can't control this then he's not … Well it is only in this situation with him because it is relevant right now. If I can't control this, him getting the visa, or him getting this apartment, then he's not going to come here because I – you know – because I didn't do… I guess in the end it is that I didn't do a good enough job. [0:29:14]</p> It would be illogical. It is so irrational that I have trouble believing that I think this, this way. But it is clear that I do.</p> Yeah.</p> Yes.</p> No.</p> No. My problem is I cannot make decisions.</p> Yeah. That is the problem.</p> Yeah everything.</p> I wouldn't like that. [0:30:06]</p> Mm hmm. For example, my dad, he has a fish business. So he sells fish to a lot of restaurants in Chicago. And so we've always gone to a lot of restaurants growing up. And sometimes because he knows the chef, they'll give us some things. Or they'll say, 'Oh we'll order for you.' And I hate it. I can't stand it. Really.</p> Yeah it is sick. (chuckling)</p> It is scary too.</p> And could very well have been the food I would have chosen.</p> I think it is a lot of not making decisions in life because I'm afraid it will be the wrong decision. Like …[0:31:08]</p> Well for example, I'm apply now – because I was in a major teaching English and I realize that I liked it. I am now applying to ESL teaching programs. I'm only applying to Finn because I can't get it together to do anything else. And it is like, if that doesn't work out this was the wrong decision. I was thinking it when I took the train to Finn, the Finn stop I was thinking it even more. Well what if this isn't what I like, and I just spent two or three years in this program doing something I don't like. And then I'm going to have this debt which I have to give back, which to be realistic is not that bad because Finn is not as expensive as other school, but it is money. It is money and wasted money. And what am I going to do after that if I decide I don't like it and don't want to teach anymore. Just like… [0:32:00]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> I don't know.</p> Thing is I'm not saying this is reason, because it is not. But I don't know a lot of people who have changed careers. At least not people my age.</p> I've changed a million times.</p> Yeah.</p> The thing is I'm really good at when they are actually mistakes, or they just didn't work out as planned. Seeing it in a positive way. I don't get very negative, like, 'Why did I do this. That was stupid.' I can see the good, the positive parts of everything. But it doesn't make me stop worrying about it, which is unfortunate because …</p> That is true.</p> Exactly.</p> Yeah. Or more than that, it is like I failed at something. I didn't do…</p> Yeah. Because maybe it didn't work. I made this decision. I've sat out on it. And now I've changed my mind again.</p> Well I think it is not that I can't stick with something, it is more that I don't know what I … I'm not 100 percent sure of what I want to do. I'm not like, 'I want to be a doctor.' And that is it and let's go. I don't know.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And it's like, it is not – I don't have… Like I said, I didn't graduate college with a set idea like lawyer, doctor. My sister she has done events, because she went to hotel school and so she stayed with that. And I'm not necessarily saying that any of those people are happier because of this, but I don't know. I don't know what I'm saying, whatever.</p> Yeah it is. But my fear is…</p> It is not. But okay there are a lot of fears that go along with this, I don't think we have enough time. But, especially this career thing. But the thing is like I always had an idea that I would like teaching, but I never wanted to pursue it because in the social circle that I grew up with it is not a very…</p> Yeah. And teaching for many reasons is looked down upon. It is for certain … in certain ways it is also like you don't have to be a genius to become a teacher, and I feel like I'm a really smart person and I could probably get a degree that is a lot more prestigious than teaching. And then I get down on myself because of that. It's like well I'm not – I can't think of the word. Like focused. Not focused, but …</p> Ambitious enough. Or yeah, driven enough. Whatever. [0:36:10]</p> Yeah I would like that more. I know it really sound really shitty, and I don't like that I feel that way.</p> I don't like that I feel that way. And I feel like I shouldn't care.</p> Yeah. [0:37:01]</p> At this point I know that I at least like it and I've tried things in corporate America and not liked it. So I'm willing to give it a shot.</p> Right. No it's true.</p> I don't know.</p> Yeah I think it is mainly that other, the way other people view me, look at me. It is mainly that in that situation, with teaching.</p> I would say you were being stupid.</p> Because if you feel like you'd be happy doing it, and it is something you want to try you should try it. If it doesn't work, ultimately if it doesn't work out you can do exactly what you just told me. There is other training. There is other things you can do.</p> It's true.</p> I know. If I look back on all the decisions I have made in my life they are all like that. If I didn't try this, I would never have gotten here. And I'm very good at seeing those things.</p> Mm hmm.</p> Yeah I think that is probably the best way to look at it. Just to add to the choice thing is though when also another thing I have trouble with when making decisions like this is; what if it doesn't work out. And fine I can accept that, and I can whatever. But then what? What the hell am I going to do. You know what I mean? It is a lot of that too.</p> That is true.</p> Yeah totally.</p> Cats.</p> Yeah.</p> But you don't always have the ability to just shut everything else down.</p> Well I mean, if I was working…</p> Yeah.</p> How do you stop it…</p> Maybe I could try it.</p> I think I probably… If I can …</p> I'm confident that if this book could have distracted me for a few minutes, that there is hope for me.</p> Yeah I think I have to get that out. [0:42:02]</p> Yeah I think I can do it.</p> I can do it. Maybe this week was just like a fluke, but there are two other examples I didn't have time to tell you, that maybe I can tell you tomorrow, that I saw an improvement. A little, at least a slight improvement. So I think… [0:43:00]</p> Oh boy, I don't know. Maybe…</p> Yeah there was a fight.</p> No.</p> We'll talk about the fight and see where that leads us maybe.</p> Yeah. Because it is very different from the not-calling issue.</p> Thank you. I'm doing homework I think it is good.</p> Oh really?</p> Yeah. What time are we supposed to meet? 4? I think you said 4.</p> So I can come at 3.</p> Fine. Perfect.</p> Alright. Thank you.</p>",0
1004513664.txt,"I'm to instruct on Thursday, Fridays.</p> So maybe like Monday, Tuesday nights.</p> Yeah.</p> Okay.</p> Okay. Because if not I can keep this if I'm going to be working as a lecturer. Then I can keep this because it will be after school.</p> So, I mean it's not a big rush.</p> But ...</p> I'm hoping to get a lecturer's position.</p> Wouldn't work unless it would before school and that wouldn't work.</p> Monday I do my internship. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.</p> I'm there at 7 a.m.</p> Yeah. It's not going to ... (chuckle) it's not going to work. That's why it all depends ... like this works for right now because then I can still get out of school and get out and over here in time.</p> So ...</p> Yeah Thursday evening could work too.</p> Yeah this works for now and then ...</p> Okay. Yeah that's not a problem.</p> Because this time works good for right now.</p> Because you know I'm already slotted in it we don't have move. So that works, thank you.</p> Thank you. So everything's going okay. Just kind of feel ... like I kind of feel sad and you know just not depressed a little, but a little anxious because ... well my girlfriend ... one of her better friends just had a child. And then this summer we have three weddings. And I'm start to kind of feel the pressure a little bit again about she wants to get married. She wants to have a child and she wants to do all this stuff. And the more and more I think about it, the more and more I know that's what I want but I don't' want to jump into it like we did last time where I know I don't have a fulltime job yet. I know that money is going to be an issue and I'm trying not to let it be an issue. And the more and more that I just play it off, you know not do it, the more and more anxious I get about it because I'm kindly like in the same boat as her. I want it sooner rather than later but I also want to have an income coming in where I'm not going to be too far behind when I have a wedding to pay for, when I have a child to pay for, when I have a house to pay for, when I have all of this stuff just coming on top.</p> Because I do not know how to be that person. I do not know how to that person where to set the boundaries where you can't have this. Because it was always given to me. Or they said I couldn't have it but then a couple, you know months would go by and then I'd have it. You know so I'm kind of up in the air again on this little scale where I'm up here, down here and I just don't know what to do. I feel like I'm just like really confused of the situation about what's going on, like, (pause) just being involved in a relationship with house, kids, you know just everyday life just because I don't want to make the wrong decisions. (pause) but I want to make the right decisions that I feel are, you know not going to lead them the path that I was at. Where they feel like, ""Okay, that was good for now, but if I stay on him, you know in a couple of weeks, couple of months I'm going to get it."" Because that's kind of like what I did, in a way. And it's just ... it's frustrating to the fact where I just (pause) I think about the money issue all the time. And the money issue really, really concerns me. Even though I ... you know I'm hopefully going to graduate in May and you know I'm going to start looking for, you know an employment positions. But I have to ... I have to wait and I'm the type of person who I can't wait because again this is the control factor was I can't control my future right now.</p> Because just being around and just talking to people ... when they say, you know you got to learn to live on someone's salary, just like one person that frightens me because I don't if ... you know, I don't know how to do that. You know I've lived on one person's salary but now I have to live on one salary with a wife, with maybe a child, with you know a house mortgage and all that stuff and all that stuff bothers me.</p> Excuse me?</p> I'm talking about ... yes.</p> No I would agree with that.</p> But it ... you know with that she mentions the fact that she would ultimately like to be a stay home mother.</p> Which I have no problem doing. But that means I have to, you know work more. Find a way to make as much income as possible. Find a way to; you know assume whatever the family needs. But then again I also am thinking right now where I (inaudible00:10:55) that's extra income. You know I do work at the restaurant, that's extra income. But on the other hand she gets upset because I am doing all this other stuff. (pause) I am you know taking other time and she feels I don't have anytime for her. And I guess I'm confused at the point. It's just like, ""Well what do you want from me?"" I'm confused that, ""Okay. Well you know that you know you make twice as much as I make and you sit there."" I go but me I'm already you know twenty thousand dollars behind your base salary. And in my mind I'm like, ""Okay well I gotta makeup just twenty thousand dollars a year just to make what she's making on base. As opposed to her making you know her bonus, her commission, all that stuff. Because in the roles that I've had I've never gotten bonuses, I've never gotten a commission, I've never gotten any of that stuff.</p> Oh yeah. She makes real good money. And she keeps telling me she never has money. And I don't understand that when she's very conservative with her money. She doesn't spend a lot of it. She doesn't ... you know she's not extravagant. She's the type of person who again is like me who worries about money that's she's never going to have enough. When she has a substantial amount saved already. She's got a substantial amount invested already. And when she tells me that she doesn't have enough money that just kind of digs at my hide a little bit more to make me realize (pause) well she's making this kind of money and I know that she's making money and I'm looking at it going, ""Jesus how the hell am I supposed to do this?""</p> She does now. She does since we've started meeting and communicating more. She does know how I feel. She does know ... we had a conversation about our conversation when you know I told her about her job and how it's still affects me. I don't know if I mentioned that last week. But I told her how; you know I felt betrayed by her. And I don't know if that was the right thing to say to her at the time but I just felt now that we were opening up more and we were communicating more that I did need to tell her how I felt.</p> I did need to tell her, you know that I still, you know have a lot of anger towards her company. I still have this anger you know and part of the anger is she's the type of person that's making all this money, you know? And she's not ... you know she told me the other day that she got credit for making money when she didn't do anything. And then it started spreading back ... flashbacks of me doing all this work for other people and other people making all this money on my back. And then ... I mean the rage didn't come in but the anger started (inaudible00:14:09) a little bit more. The anger to the fact that you know how could people just do this? Take this money when they don't deserve it. How could a company pay someone who had nothing to do with, you know? And I look at myself and I'm like, ""What am I doing wrong where I can't just fall into money like that?"" Where I can't just do nothing and the next thing you know, ""Oh here's a present for you."" and nobody says anything. To me that's very frustrating. You know it's very frustrating to the point where, you know what she could make in commissions or a bonus is more than what I make in a years salary.</p> Yeah.</p> And I guess that's my problem though is because I do look ahead. I do kind of jump the gun a little bit. Because I do feel ... and I don't if it's just me or if it's us, you know from everybody I talk to because I get it, you know my parents, I get it from her, I get it from her mother. You know I kind of feel like I'm getting a lot pressure on me to be engaged, to start a family, to get married and to do all this stuff. Even my great aunts and uncles are the same way. They're like, ""Well we need to do something. Like what are you waiting for?""</p> It's coming from outside and it's like a lot of peer pressure. And it's to the point, well like every holiday comes or goes and I get the same question over and over. And I'm starting ... the rage is starting to buildup like, ""Leave me alone. I'll do it when I'm ready."" You know, I know what my plan is but I just don't know when I'm going to execute it. Because right now I'm at a stand still because I feel like, you know on financial mountain I'm still at the base. You know I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a ring and then you know be in debt with that. I don't want to do that (pause) because I keep hearing too you can't get it less than this, you can get her a ring that cost this much. You can't do this you can't do that. And to me that bothers me because they don't know what I'm doing. They don't know what I want to do. I know what I want to do.</p> Mm-hm.</p> I am. And (pause) it's new to me too because, you know I kind of ... this is what I'm control of, this is what I can control and I feel I have no control over it. And that's what you know it irritates me. You know if frustrates me into the saying, ""This is the one thing I thought I had a full grasp on."" And now I completely feel like my hands have slipped and I'm holding on by like two fingers. Because everybody else is putting in, everybody else is throwing their two cents in. Everybody else is, you know, ""Well this is what you need to do. This is what you need to do."" My parents are giving me a timeline. They're like, ""Are you going to have a grandkid before I'm seventy?"" That's in five years. I don't know. You know and it's just ... I feel like you know my life is controlled by other people. Where they just want to lead me into this direction. You know when really I just want to go in my direction. And it is frustrating because I just ... I don't know what to do.</p> And I don't ... you know the more and more ... and this is the part that you know coming to these sessions has helped me on is now I'm thinking more rationally. But the more I look back on it the rational thinking is more complicated than the reactionary thinking.</p> Because reactionary I just do something to put people in their place and then worry about it. Now I'm just taking in all this information and thinking about every aspect of it and when I think about every aspect well then my big decision-making comes in again and I can't take it. (pause) Because I don't want to ask for people's opinion because people are still giving their opinions. You know what I mean? It's weird when before I make a decision I need like three or four, five different opinions and then I'd make a decision on what my parents thought. Now I'm getting all these opinions when I never asked for them. Putting them all together and I need to make a decision and I'm having doubts about what decision to make.</p> I do care.</p> Mm-hm.</p> Well (pause) see because I don't really know because my whole life was based on what everybody thought. Where I did a lot of my decision making based on the reaction I'd get from people. You know, how people thought of me? How they reacted when they see the things that I did and what I ... you know what I was doing. And now I guess I'm scared of their reactions. I'm scared of what they're going to think of me because I want to do the right thing. I want to do it my way.</p> But there's that fear of me, you know stepping out on the ledge without anyone holding my hand or crossing the street without anyone holding my hand. And am I going to be able to really do it, you know? Because part of me has the leash on me. Part of me has, you know the ropes saying, ""Hey don't forget about us over here."" You know and that's the trouble I have because I was so dependent on my parents. I was so dependent on their opinions on what they, you know they thought was good for me and I'm slowly ... not as fast as I'd like too but I'm progressively you know cutting the string, cutting the cord, cutting the rope to the point where I don't want, you know, I don't need their opinions. I don't need their decision-making. You know it's extremely difficult because after so many years of just repetition, you know doing this. Why are you doing this? Why can't you do this? Do it this way not that way. It's slowly you know ... it's hard to break away. Because it's what I'm used to. It's what I'm comfortable with.</p> And that's the hardest part is getting out of my comfort zone.</p> I'm comfortable with the fact that I'm going to have to make this big decision to break away from them sometime.</p> I told myself that I am, you know someday my parent's aren't going to be here and I'm going to have to move on. I know that part. I know that for a fact. But part of me also is comfortable in the fact well I have them here. They're still in good health. They're still, you know up and moving around. Why are you giving up that opinion? Why are you giving up that life? So I'm kind of you know torn again between where I'm comfortable in the fact that you know someday they're not going to be here. But also I'm not comfortable in the fact where, you know even though they're around and they can do it, to just you know move on. And the hardest part is moving on while they're still around.</p> I think it probably would be easier to move around because I wouldn't have that safety to go back too. But now I think the safety of it is preventing me from just doing what I want to do.</p> Excuse me. And that's the hardest part that I have right now and it's still ... it's a constant struggle. I mean I see the same thing with my brothers. I mean my sister, you know she's ... I'll give it to her, she's the independent one in the family. She said she was moving out, she moved out when she was 20-year-old, hasn't been back since. You know I only moved out to go to college and then I moved in with my girlfriend. I was back in you know, a few months.</p> So I don't know what it is about my brothers and me, you know we can't let go of our parents. We can't move on from them. And to me it's its frustrating. Because I do want ... you know I ... again I see my parents I do want you know a home. I do want a family. I do want all this stuff. But again I keep telling myself how am I going to get it staying at home? How am I going to get it living the life that I'm living? But then again I'm not totally unhappy living the life that I'm living.</p> And it's ... I guess it's a balance thing that I'm slowly working on. I'm slowly trying to move on and to be independent and to do the things that I want to do. Just because I don't know why. I guess I've never, you know had that sense of freedom of being able to go wherever. But in a way I did. Where my parents ... even when I was in high school I never had curfews. You know I never had, you know I was never disciplined for any of this stuff. You know my parents just kind of let me ... gave me some freedom to live my life. To come and go as I pleased and I did. And I think that was where the problem was because I thought I needed a little bit more structure because you know if I had a curfew in high school of you know say midnight or eleven o'clock then you know maybe I would have felt intimidated or scared by you know breaking these rules. But I never, I never had it. I was always given freedom, you know I mean I parents always used to give me money before I'd go out in high school. ""You need money?"" And they'd give me like thirty or forty bucks. And I'd be like, ""Okay."" You know, and that's how my life was. I always had it handed to me. I never ... I mean my girlfriend tells me this, she had purchase her first car from her parents. They showed her some responsibility with money and how to take care of it and pay for other stuff. When I was given a car my first car. I didn't have to pay for the gas. I didn't have to pay for the insurance. I didn't have to pay for the maintenance on it. She had to pay for the gas. She had to pay for the insurance. She had to pay for the maintenance. You know all this stuff, I look back on and I'm just like, well why didn't they, you know set a better structure for me? Why didn't they, you know have guidelines that I needed? You know and me again being a control person I'm jumping a hundred steps forward thinking how am I going to have these guidelines with my children?</p> How am I going to say no to them when I was never said no too?</p> Well that is tough because I ... I mean my parents still you know, ""How are doing for money? You need some?"" And sometimes I do take it because I do ... I do get nervous that I'm going to need it.</p> You know it does and I kind of feel like I'm an addict for my parents.</p> You know? And I do have an addictive personality. I'm not going to lie. Because getting back to the drugs. Like I started with marijuana or started with alcohol. Then I went to marijuana and then I went to prescription pills, you know then it went to harder drugs. Then I went to cocaine and then it just you know kind of spiraled. Like I just tried on new things. But that addiction of my parents is always been there. Where you know even when I needed it and I never stole from my parents. I never stole from any of my family members but you know I felt bad in college when I'd blow through all my money. You know I'd work and it would be gone. And then my parents would be, ""Do you need some money?"" And I'd take it and I'd use it on drugs. And to me that's you know (pause) it's to point where I knew if needed ... if I wanted the drug so bad I knew where I could get the finances for it. And for my parents to not ask where it was going, how I was going through hundreds of dollars so fast (pause) not questioning anything really kind of ... you know it ... thinking back on it I kind of am upset because I mean I wasn't going to tell them that I was doing drugs. But I feel bad in the sense that I lied to them and they were feeding my addiction.</p> They were feeding my addiction for the drugs. They were feeding you know my addiction to drink, to do all the stuff, to go out. And it's kind of like the freedom that I had you know in high school where they didn't ask questions. They just gave.</p> Mm-hm.</p> I guess that's right. Because I mean I was never taught any of this stuff. And then I'd slowly get you know falling into the fire and I'd get frustrated because I didn't know anything. And I'd get you know and that's when I'd get like angry and upset because I didn't know anything. And that is you know an alarming factor to me is why am I staying there? What am I waiting for them to take care of me for? I'm an adult. Why am I still doing the things that I did before but I'm not do it. What I'm doing now is just totally different. I'm trying to move on and I can't.</p> You know most people talk you know, ""I can't wait to get our of my house. I can't wait to do this."" And me I'm just like why would I leave? I have everything I want, why would I leave? And that's the mentality that I'm slowly trying to push away, to cut the cord with, is the why would I leave mentality. (pause) I mean I just ... I don't know how ... I don't know what to do. I mean I'm so, so wrapped up in it that it feels like every layer that I peel off, the layers below it are even thicker. And just trying to cut the surface and break the surface. It's harder. It's harder because in a way I don't want to ... and I know I gotta you know get over this but (pause) I felt guilty that I left them the way I did before. I felt guilty that they needed me. That they did you know depend on me a lot. And now that I've moved back there I found out that they don't need me. That they didn't need me as much as I thought they did and it's harder for me now to accept that. (pause) Because that was kind of the whole reasoning that I didn't move back. Was because you know my brothers ... I really didn't have any you know confidence in them to help out or do anything just because they never had.</p> They were like me they did their own thing. But I was the one who always hung back, took care of my parents first then did my own thing. So now it's to the point where, ""Okay well I'm back."" I know they can survive. I know they'll be okay, you know? What do I need to do to move forward? To just move on. And that's what I'm slowly telling myself and discussing through my head is they will be okay. They will be able to survive. You know they don't need you anymore. Where I used to depend on them so much they don't depend on me as much because they can do their own thing. They can you know survive; they have my brothers. You know they don't need ... they don't need me. And in reality is I don't want to believe that. I want to believe that they need me.</p> To just be like supportive. Like if they need something done they can ask me and I'll do it. If you know ... to depend on me to be there. It's kind of like we talked about you know last week is how I feel indebted to them. I feel like I can't do enough for them to payoff my debt. I can't get over the fact where you know they're my parents, they're supposed to do that. You know it's like I talked about where you know I do things for weak people just because I want to feel like how I feel towards my parents. Is where people will feel that way towards me. But when it's me who's that person who's indebted (pause) I don't know how to say, ""Okay my debts been paid.""</p> I don't know how to say it's okay you can move on.</p> I don't know. I don't know. That's what I can't answer. (pause) I mean I'm indebted for all the things that did. Well to start I mean I want to say that indebted for the things that they gave me. They helped you know my dad put four children through college. My dad gave us cars, he helped buy us cars. You know everything I needed he was there to give. But I guess in reality for the (pause) I mean the more and more I think about it the more and more like the gifts and the stuff that I got, you know maybe it was just a cop-out for you know him not being around when we were younger as much as we had liked. Maybe it was you know him calling to his mother's house all the time and not coming home until like an hour or so before we were ready to go to bed. Maybe it was you know how when I was little he you know he'd come to all my hockey games but like when I was on travel baseball you know I always had to get a ride. And my dad would come and I would look in stands waiting for him and he wouldn't come until like almost the end of the game because he was working. I don't know. (pause) You know maybe it's just because I am upset at the fact that I didn't get to spend as much quality time with my dad as I wanted to.</p> Look at all these other kids who's like dads coached their team. Whose dads got involved in stuff. I think maybe that's why I got involved in coaching because I didn't want to miss any of this stuff. You know from the time when I had a child. Maybe it's you know I don't want to be that you know father who drops his kid off and you know, ""Call me when it's over."" I don't want to miss that. I want to be there. I want to be a part of that. To me that's ... I think that's what hurts the most is I wanted that support system when I was playing and when I was doing stuff and I never got it. (pause) I never got it and I guess that's why I you know I coached my little brother. I got into coaching. Because why the reason I started coaching was because my little brother's team needed a coach. When I went and did all the stuff and got licensed in three months to coach his team. And I never missed his practice. I never missed his games.</p> I think I did. I really do. Because my dad would come to all the games but he wouldn't go to the practices. You know ... well he would come to the practices and stuff but it was only for hockey. You know even for baseball like my dad would never ... he'd never come to baseball practice. Which is fine. Baseball practice I didn't need you but he very rarely came from beginning to end for all my baseball games. Even soccer he very rarely came to all my you know beginning to end soccer games. He'd always come you know half way through or miss it. It's just like ... and to me like I don't know looking back on it I'd get upset because I was you know ... he paid for all these camps for me to go to to get better. And I was one of the top athletes from them and usually if you're one of them usually your parents want to be a part of that. My mother absolutely had no support with them. All she did was drop us off. She never came and watched any games. She never came ... I mean she was good. She used to get you know used to get ... thinking back on it she used to get frustrated because we'd have practice and she'd have you know two kids that weren't doing sports because of work and she'd have to go across town and then back across town and do all of this stuff and drive us around and my dad wasn't there. So I guess my mother, I saw her negative energy towards it and I guess it kind of made me feel bad when I just didn't want to do it anymore.</p> But they knew that I loved being involved so much that it ... you know they didn't have the heart to take it away from me.</p> I mean I would have devastated if they took away baseball and hockey from me. But if they could not meet the required ... the commitment to have me to practice and to games all the time, would I have understood it back then? No. Now, yes. If they told me no I couldn't do it I wouldn't be able to forgive them for that. But I think the most hurtful thing is to you know not have that support that I was looking for. You know then I see my little brother where you know I did take on that support role. I was there. I was his coach but I was there. I was at every game. I was at every practice. I didn't miss much. I didn't want to miss it. And right now it's to the point where as I'm getting older I'm coaching all these teams and I'm just like, ""Well you know this is what I want to do. This is what you know I want to be a part of this."" But as I get older the more and more I'm thinking about you know family and stuff is if I'm coaching this new team, you know am I going to have time to go to my kid's game? I mean I look back at the guy I coach with who's you know one of my best friends whose older, who's a police officer. Where he coached, you know we coached one team and his son was on the other team. And the only game that he got to watch of his sons was when they played us.</p> And that like that bothered me a little bit. I'm like why are you even coaching? Go watch your kid play.</p> You know? I get frustrated to the point where you know people miss their children's stuff. I get frustrated at the point where people you know just drop their kids off and then come and pick them up. That irritates me. Especially games where it's just like, ""Well I mean you couldn't stay. You were too busy you couldn't stay and watch your kid play for an hour? Two hours?"" Like that really bugs me.</p> You know and I guess that's probably because of the anger that's been built up because I never had it. (pause) I used to I mean my dad used to criticize me for not playing. Because he'd get there and be like, ""Well you're not playing."" ""I did. But you weren't there. Like I started."" You know like (pause) ... it's frustrating.</p> Yeah. Well I was given too much of one thing and then not enough of the other. And that's where my scale is ... it's off balance. You know I feel like I was given more than I was ... you know the other way. And it's frustrating. It's frustrating because in essence I wanted less of this one and more of this one. But I ended up getting this one to counterbalance this one going down.</p> And it (pause) it is frustrating because people do say like ... and I don't want to say that ... I didn't have a bad childhood. But in a way I did. (pause) Because I mean I got everything I wanted. I did everything I wanted to do but I still like (inaudible00:44:25). I don't feel like I had the support. I don't feel that I have the structure to say, ""No you can't do that. Yes that's fine you can do that. No you can't do that."" And I guess that's what I'm lacking is even now is I can't say no to myself. Because if I want something I'll just go do it (pause) and if I you know if I know I'm not supposed to do something, I'll do it. You know when ... you know ... I don't really know the meaning of the word 'no'.</p> I don't really know, ""No you can't do that."" I don't know because to me no means, ""Okay wait a couple of weeks or whatever."" And it will mean yes.</p> You know that's (pause) that's what I was you know growing up with. That's what I know. That's you know what I'm comfortable with.</p> And breaking away from that is (pause) not comforting.</p> Okay.</p> All righty. Thank you, Dr. Feldman.</p> All righty. Thanks.</p>",0
1004798823.txt,"I have decided to talk about something not so Meta to make this less hard core feeling.</p> Jeremy pointed out you can talk about whatever you want. So yesterday, I felt like I was going to faint during a lunch seminar and I watched myself very carefully and I don't know how the anxiety about fainting got so intense so quickly. So it's a classic like fainting setup. I was really tired, as you know. I was...Kelly asked me to be one of the students to take the speaker out to lunch at 1:00, so lunch talk. I normally would have eaten at noon. And even though I had eaten before coming here, by the time I got the talk, I was starving. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And I haven't been so where as I was yesterday that there was a big anxiety comes on. But it was really clear. I didn't have to poop. Like that was weird. And I...I don't know. I meant my blood pressure might have dropped a little bit...and my blood sugar, but there was nothing really drastic physically that caused this anxiety. It was like the anxiety about it caused some pretty strong physical sensations. [Pause]. </p> Yes. I think most of it is anxiety symptoms.</p> I think there is the knowledge that I'm hungry, the knowledge that I'm tired, and the knowledge that I'm in this big seminar in the front row. And like the feeling of being tired and hungry, but I was tired and hungry for the first 20 minutes of the talk and didn't...like it was sort of just like this lapse in concentration. My like mind darted to; oh this is sort of like the perfect storm for fainting. And had I stayed there, I might have fainted. Like it's not that it wasn't going to happen. I felt it coming on. </p> So I mean my mom...my family; I grew up in a really structured eating household where that wasn't that much structure for other things. And it's because my mom and her mom both had sort of pretty strong sensations when they have low blood sugar and they have severe headaches and general malaise. And then my grandfather is diabetic. So both my mom, who does most of the cooking, and my grandfather, who is the elderly person who for whom there is a lot of service, have these sorts of constraints that...and just like my parents value eating dinner together. So we ate pretty much between 7:00 and 7:30 like every day my whole life together. It was a big thing to miss dinner, like to be with a friend. So there was both a family togetherness component and a...turns out when I was in a situation where I wasn't eating at the same time every day my body wasn't really used to that, and I guess my, emotionally, I wasn't really used to what it was like to, you know, stick it through...stick through that feeling of hunger. [Pause].</p> Yeah. But if I'm hungry at home, I never feel anxious. [Pause]. Because I'm in a very very known environment in which access to food or water is like available at any time even if I'm cooking dinner and it's not going to be ready for an hour or if I'm waiting for Jeremy or whatever. [Pause].</p> Similarly, I never felt anxious at home around the wedding much. [Pause]. There's a pretty big difference sometimes between how I feel...if I'm sitting at the kitchen table around the counter doing anything and being out in the world. [Pause].</p> That's why you can talk about whatever you want to, but I'm...I started talking about something different, which sets a different tone for me, and it's fine if it always gets back to the unifying thing.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I sort of get like caught in this wave. [Pause].</p> Yeah, I guess that's true. [Pause]. Sometimes she like can be way more evil in my head than how she really is. And actually, I have a pretty healthy relationship with her now compared to in previous years. So I don't think I'm being irrational all the time, but I am...there are actually times to be like a culture of irrationality when it comes to Kelly and what her reactions might be. She's pretty unpredictable. But she didn't notice at all. Like I watched her. And I asked a question at the end of the seminar and I was sitting in the back of the room by then and she like called on me and was very happy to have me asking a question and didn't indicate any...you know, it's stupid. But it was just the thing that was in my head at the time of like, I feel bad, but I can't get up. </p> Dun, dun dun. I think that's bold. [Pause]. Because there aren't a lot of people who always make me feel trapped, but okay; a second time. </p> I think it's my own judgment too.</p> Yeah.</p> What's the evidence that I'm not? </p> Or like that I got up?</p> Yeah. [Pause]. Or like that I can go to jazz rehearsal and play whatever I want and it's fine. [Pause]. But it still feels bad. </p> Like the trap is still there.</p> Yeah, Jeremy's pretty good about giving me positive feedback at rehearsal when he feels there is something positive. And I resist that feedback pretty strongly. I think I don't do that elsewhere, but maybe I do. </p> Like a niche.</p> Oh, a saxophone. </p> So there like aren't a lot of alto saxophone players. And if you're a good big band alto saxophone player, there are a lot of opportunities to play. </p> I am in demand. So that was cool and I practiced a lot when I had like fear of not staying in the band or like band audition to get in a band, or a performance coming up and all of that structure is like gone away now. Performances, which do drive me to practice in graduate school, but otherwise...it's almost like the rehearsals aren't so anxiety provoking that I don't care that much about sounding bad. And if they were, I probably wouldn't do it anymore. But they're not sort of...I'm not at ease enough with them to want to have that experience more than once a week. [Pause].</p> That seems reasonable. [Pause].</p> I just remember...[pause]...like the thing about picking and choosing or identifying things that I liked was sort of shaped by like what certain either like what I liked in other people or like what certain people liked in me or liked seemed attracted to. </p> Yeah. And like boys are kind of important in high school to a girl, so yeah, there were some pretty significant people.</p> Uh huh. I think this whole thing was a cycle because I started getting really really attractive to a certain kind of boy and I think I really liked that. And then you know, they were like all musicians, like four musicians. [Pause]. Or three musicians who like were smart and one of them is a film maker now. We were like cool and smoked weed and read poetry and philosophy and excelled in a very very...[pause]...sort of like rare way in music. </p> Yeah, and how they were able to be so talented at other things, like got in to Harvard and Yale and I guess these are two main guys, who played drums. And one played piano. And there was another guy. At college, my first month, he played drums. And there weren't a lot of females who sort of fit in to that world because there were like three people in jazz band in the first place. And all the really smart girls who were kind of cool and wrote and played Chess and were sort of independent minded were...maybe didn't have that much sex appeal from what I...from my own interpretation of them. Because they were really cool too, but I guess I sort of had this combination of the two that I was cultivating and was also deeply introspective and was very very sort of like intense person to be with one on one. </p> Okay. </p>",1
1004687650.txt,"Oh, I'm so out of it today (laughs). It may not be my most coherent day ever (laughs). </p> Um...</p> Yeah, I'll let you know in August. Cuz I'll have my return ticket, so...</p> I'll let you know. Uh (laughs)...oh man. Yeah I'm so sleepy and I have no good reason to be sleepy. </p> But for some reason for the last week or so it's been like I have mono again. </p> I've just been like freakishly tired. </p> Um, and yeah I'm not quite sure what it is, but I worry that I have another food allergy which would be a huge hassle cuz I seem to get more tired when I eat or drink alcohol. </p> Which (inaudible at 00:01:24].3) always get more tired when you drink alcohol, but like it's been sort of like...I haven't been reacting so well, so it's really (pause) um, so yeah it's sort of irritating. I think I had a week after getting back from the retreat where I felt really like (inaudible at 00:01:46].4)...</p> ...reading fiction every day and really like, ya know, feeling pretty good. [0:01:51.7]</p> Yeah. Um, and then I started focusing on other things and got to feeling a little bit more like negative ways I felt in the past (laughs) which was disappointing. </p> I have to have more than a week of feeling (inaudible at 00:02:21].9). Again I don't know how much of it is just some physical thing that I haven't figured out yet. Like maybe I need to stop eating soy and then I won't be so tired all the time and everything will be easy, but, uh...I don't know. </p> Um, oh! I guess it's funny because ya know when I was starting to feel worse and worse last time like, it was like I'm like I wasn't sure how much of it was physical and how much of it was mental and you know I still don't really know because just so many different things are going on and like the proportions of it are sort of (inaudible at 00:03:15].1) serious. </p> Um, and I think this time it's like I can tell that I feel worse every time after I eat or have...or drink something other than water, and sometimes that, which is a clue, um, but I also 3 nights in a row this week had dreams that seemed sort of like the dreams I used to have that were trying to tell me thing. </p> Um...just because certain scenes in the dream would be emphasized with my memory in a way that said like you are supposed to remember this scene. </p> Um...</p> Yeah, sure. Um, the first night I remember sort of a large sequence but one particular scene seemed foremost in importance, even though I remember it of, ya know, a larger sequence pretty well. Um, but the part that was important was my mom called me home to say there was a problem with my pet hamster. I've never had a pet hamster but I always sort of felt sorry for people that had hamsters when I would see them because people always keep them in such small cages. Like even the sort of big hamsters? Ya know they're in the same size cages like the little mouse hamsters and they're always like pretty bored (laughs). </p> Um, so yeah in my dream I like went home and saw this, like really like beautiful like big glossy hamster in a sort of large fish tank-looking thing and took it out to see what was up and it like jumped out of my hand and started ya know hiding under the furniture and I would like lift different pieces of furniture and it would just zoom under something else before I could catch it. Um, and something about the speed and intensity with which it was running away was bothering me, but like my pet hamster didn't want to be around me...</p> ...and I got really determined to catch it...</p> ...um, and took a sort of bisected fruit box that, so ya know it was like there was open space on the two sides but then the line in the middle where they joined and I was trying to catch the hamster...</p> So there were two halves.</p> I guess...it was like an orange crate but like a cardboard box...</p> ...but you could open like a jewelry box or a music box...</p> ...or something. Um, and it was the concept of putting a jar over a spider. </p> Except, ya know, the hamster was a Ball jar. </p> (laughs) Um, and so like the hamster ran out and I had this box and I like slammed the box down and then I freaked out because I was like what if I slammed the center line on top of the hamster and like I could have like just killed my hamster. I can't believe I just did that. And I lifted the box a little and the hamster zoomed out again (laughs) but at that point I felt really shitty cuz like I had (inaudible at 00:06:34].3) it's life. Um, and then it ran into this like...you know the dream took place in my house in Texas which has some doorways without doors in them...and they're not supposed to have doors and they're just like, ya know. </p> So it like laid down in the middle of one of those doors and like played dead really convincingly and I recognized that it was playing dead but I was sort of like fascinated by why I thought that I was a good idea, and like my dog that I had as a child came over and started sniffing and I like shooed her away cuz I was worried she might bite it, and...and I realized it would be like a really good time to catch the hamster since it was like immobile so I kept wondering how close I could get to it without it moving. I'm like what it was thinking. Um, and then it like ran away again, and then I finally managed to catch it with my hands and I was really afraid it was going to bite my hands. Um, and then...but it didn't and then I put it in a neat house which was like this weird thing that looked sort of like a doll house or like, ya know, My Little Pony house, ya know? Something more like plastic with sort of humanoid like table and chair things that I thought the hamster would probably (laughs) enjoy (laughs) (inaudible at 00:08:05].8). And I asked my mom if we were going to get a hamster wheel to put in there and she said like no, like a hamster of that size is too smart to be entertained by like running in place on a hamster wheel, and that's where it ends (laughs). I don't know (laughs). And it's sort of rare to remember a sequence like that in such clear detail. Um, and just like the sensation of feeling (A) like sorry for the hamster and like worrying that it would starve if it just ran loose in the house, so feeling like I ought to catch it but also feeling very bad about catching it and putting it in a small house.</p> Um, and just being alarmed at like the person that made me as I was running around trying to catch it. Um (pause) yeah, so there was that one. Uh, and then the next night there was another long sequence of which I remember parts. But the part that stood out very vividly was um going on a drive to a lake that I had enjoyed as a child with driving in a nice convertible with Seth and I was driving and like showing him this place he'd never seen. And I remembered that there were like starfish you could see under the water, um, which so (yawns) I went canoeing with Seth at a lake that was sort of like this...</p> ...um, when I was a child, but...so driving there the road was like strangely windy and you couldn't really see what was ahead and since I was a child the starfish had grown extremely large and more like fast and flexible and they could also live out of the water, so there were trees full of starfish, really large starfish, and um I started to get nervous because we were in a convertible and we couldn't close the top and the starfish in the trees were sort of threatening...</p> ...and they were starting to sort of like wave their arms and show interest in us, and it seems that one of them communicated to me somehow through just a telepathic message that it like was thinking about, ya know, jumping into the car and like covering my face and like eating me and suffocating me, which was pretty terrifying.</p> And at that point like the road looked like it might be in danger of going into the water or something or, ya know, becoming very dangerous (laughs). Um, so there was that one. And then the next night, ya know, it was another long narrative, but um the scary part was I was going back and forth between being myself and this character. Did you ever watch the TV show Battlestar Galatica?</p> Yeah. </p> Oh, it's so good. You should watch it. </p> (laughs) But, um (laughs) and there's, there's like the character I relate to the most, her name is Sharon and um...so at first you think she is just like a normal crew member and then she finds out, like I think in the second season or something, that she's actually a Cylon, and the Cylons are this sort of like mechanized android-like species that um, so like the humans created to help them with practical matters.</p> And they got more and more intelligent...</p> ...and eventually created ones that looked just like humans and they're like pretty impossible to tell apart from a human, so...</p> Yeah. So I mean she didn't know.</p> And then she found out. Um, and like that particular Sharon dies but then another Sharon model comes back who always knew she was a Cylon and is like much better adjusted. [0:12:40.2]</p> Um, and lives among the humans and like marries a human. Um, so here I tell you to watch it and then I go spoiling everything for you. </p> Now I feel terrible. (laughs) </p> (laughs) The whole thing just gets ruined for you (laughs).</p> Um, so yeah it's kind of funny but um and then like ya know Seth when I told him that like that was my favorite character he was like oh, of course, like you're not actually human. Of course you can relate to her. (laughs) Um (laughs), so in the dream somehow I was going back and forth between being myself and being Sharon and somehow we...I mean were like the same person sort of but just at different point. Um, and there was some child that had come into our care somehow, I think through the sort of things that happen inside my situation (laughs).</p> Children show up for me to care for them...</p> ...because you're on some sort of mission. </p> Um, and I mean it was one of those dreams where things kept changing. It wasn't like the other two...</p> ...where it was like I was one person and the situation, the narrative continued. </p> It's like this one, but I (inaudible at 00:14:09].9) a lot. </p> Um, but the child was sometimes a child and sometimes a doll that was alive and could walk, much like the horror movie dolls that come to life. Um, and like I remember I had, ya know, like given it a name since it doesn't seem to have one, and it was clearly a very troubled child and it would play with knives a lot when it wasn't being watched carefully. </p> So there'd be a lot of moments of like losing track of it and then coming back to find that it was, ya know, setting things on fire or playing with knives. </p> But even still feeling sort of obligated to watch it cuz like, you know, I couldn't let it starve...much like the hamster (laughs). </p> Um, and it became clearer that it was like a doll and somehow there were like flashbacks to child slash doll's past in which it looked a lot like me when I was a child and was having its hair burnt somehow.</p> I mean I did catch my hair on fire by accident once. </p> Um, I was just lighting candles to put in Halloween Jack-O-Lanterns and I had the hair down to my waist so I didn't always know what I was doing and it was getting in the candles (laughs) at that time. </p> No, but my hair did get burned such that there was like a gradation of um like frizzy hair I guess. </p> Um, and you know it took a while to like to get the burned parts out. Um, so, so it was very strange. Feeling like I was like a strange child and sort of my past self a little bit and this doll. Um, and so during the mission we were escaping from alien forces that were trying to kill us all (laughs)...</p> ...and we had found like this small like cluster of humans who were living in like a science experiment facility of some sort and they could lock themselves underground and be safe from the invading forces and um, so we got to their compound. Just barely got in with the aliens on our tail of course because it was a sci-fi story so of course they were like right there before the door closed. </p> Um...</p> Exactly. (laughs) But once we got to like the people who were sort of letting us in through the turnstile, um, we saw that they were making some of these, ya know, walking/talking doll creatures and there was like a model of the one we had who had somehow developed like 5 eyes over the course of things and it had like the model's name on it. It was sort of similar to the name that I had given it, but different. </p> And so the child/doll like saw itself and like totally freaked out at me, which I was Sharon at the time and like...</p> ...and like got furious for like having the wrong name. Um...</p> And like not being told who she was, and although you know I had no idea that there were these doll experiments being created (laughs). Um, and at that point I was like really started fearing for my safety and that the child/doll was going to like freak out and kill me with some knives she might have stored on her person. Um, then I don't remember what happened next, but...so it was all like these like threatening interactions (laughs) with...</p> ...these things that I still caused to be subservient. (pause) </p> (laughs) </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. [0:22:37.5]</p> Yeah. Um...</p> I do. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. I mean I do worry about it and um I feel like even sort of bad worrying about it because it seems like worrying about it is almost like inviting it back. </p> Um, and I wish I could just like keep riding that wave from the retreat. </p> Um, cuz once you're living an extremely clean world in a certain way, you sort of wonder why you have to stop that. Like maybe if you just don't let yourself slip back for a moment you can just keep going and (laughs) um...and it sort of felt like coming back and sort of like dragging me down into old mental patterns and I don't really know why. Um, cuz I would like to fix it. I'm the main driver behind my feelings and experiences and...but just going into the same rooms and seeing the same people doesn't have to just drag me back to completely different phase of my life (laughs). </p> Um, I don't like to think that my environment has so much power over me. And it's like stupid why...cuz it's not like anything has happened while I've been back that would like (inaudible at 00:24:36].2). Um except like you know I've been trying not to write fiction because I have so many other things to do right now that should be a higher priority. Um, it's the only thing I've been doing that seems risky (inaudible at 00:24:59].5). Um, and you know instead of (inaudible at 00:25:05].2) things since I came back that, um, just having...I mean writing really puts me in touch I think with a lot of different like layers of my experience and ya know I know I feel like I'm in touch with like a deeper more whole self, like on a regular basis when I'm writing regularly...</p> ...and I think there...yeah, yeah. When I'm, ya know, when that's a big part of my life it's, it's great and so uh not having that in the last week it's been a little bit strange and it's hard to know whether it's because like I do have some (inaudible at 00:25:50].9) or I'm sick or sort of would rather not think, which is maybe (inaudible at 00:26:00].4) or whatever still does have more power than I would really like to think, and it's sort of time to like screw things up since I'm not giving it what it wants and it's like making me sick. But I really hope that without sort of the Wellbutrin to destabilize things and give it like an entrée into...</p> ...my nervous system, without like the birth control it's just like screwing up my hormones.</p> But everything would be more stable and not so easy to just unsettle um for very small reasons like taking a week off from fiction writing which doesn't seem like a change still (laughs).</p> Yeah. Um...</p> Yeah, yeah. And when I was at the retreat and writing a lot here in the week after...</p> ...like I didn't really feel like there was some mechanism that like this other thing that was trying to push an agenda in mysterious ways that I couldn't fathom like...and it was, ya know, when I was like working with the textbook writing, um, I didn't feel that as much, but then at The retreat like I really felt pretty normal again. Um, and ya know it really would be nice to think that everything is totally like reintegrated and stable and I don't want to sort of give it another avenue just by like being paranoid and questioning things and sort of like call it up again almost. </p> Like it almost seems like one of those horror movie demons where you shouldn't say his name 3 times or it will come back. </p> (pause) Yeah I guess I'm having a hard time figuring out...</p> ...what to think, um, and how much sort of like credit to give it for things that have gone wrong in the past. </p> Um, and ya know having had experiences in the past 2 months where my mind really was working normally um sort of puts in relief how...like the degree to which my mind just was not working in the past and um, ya know, when that was the status quo I think it was a lot easier to think oh, everyone...everyone's mind feels like this and I'm just really bad at getting past it. </p> Um, so I mean now I'm able to really feel like, ya know, her mind doesn't work like that. Like even mine doesn't. </p> (laughs) And that was not at all like something...</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. Yeah, and with both like Sharon and the...</p> ...when it was like definitely a doll, I mean part of the tension in the show is that I mean they seem so human but...</p> ...that it seems sort of unethical to deny them...</p> ...that designation. </p> Um, and I think in thinking about the mechanism I'm always really uncomfortable saying it's either, ya know, like an authentic part of me that I tried to stifle or it's not...it's just the sort of like negative formation of reactions that was more like a sickness or something. Maybe it's a lot of resistance of thinking of it as that because in the past when I tried to agree with that way like it would seem like it was getting angry and I could feel like sort of like flares of energy in my brain that were negative reactions to those thoughts. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's sort of the like the uncanny thing about it is that it seems other but it's so familiar and deep at the same time that I can never quite like disown it. I...I think you know that's obvious to me as a lie. </p> Um, but it's also very strange because it seems like there are certain things that it is just totally unaware of, like getting practical sometimes for instance. I mean like when it was...when it still had like a channel with the Wellbutrin and everything and could like communicate better formed ideas...</p> ...like they were just like so full of logical holes (laughs). We'd be like what is this thing that is somehow like part of myself but hasn't really been paying attention to how the world work (laughs). They're like it doesn't know all of these things that I know, and ya know. </p> (laughs) </p> I think that's so. (pause) I guess it's strange to see an emotional life coming up with like plans for how I'm supposed to live my life and just seeing how sort of impossible they are. And getting punished for not acting on them. Like it wanting me to go live in a cabin in the woods and eat roots and berries and stop talking to people. Like I don't even know what like berries are poisonous and which ones aren't. Like thinking that that would be somehow safer than normal life (laughs). [0:35:48.2]</p> (laughs) </p> Yeah. </p> (laughs) </p> Yeah. I mean it seems like something I was actually supposed to do. </p> Which (inaudible at 00:37:32].2) sort of like threatening. </p> And as we've talked about this I'm getting some slight visual disturbances. </p> And then we reviewed the opposite plan too which was to give away all my possessions and go to New York and start like, ya know, in the anti-capitalist collective to try to, ya know, overcome capitalist government. (laughs). Sort of. Not like...I mean at least it didn't want me to assemble an army or something. That would have been worse. </p> Like getting a group of like guerilla artists and activists together was like a little unpractical than like getting a bunch of guns or something (laughs). </p> Um, but it's still not very practical.</p> And not very safe. </p> Yeah. (pause) You know I mean in both situations you don't have to trust people that much cuz like in the cabin there are no other people and when you're trying to sort of overturn the government like in a situation in which you like (inaudible at 00:39:16].9) and you don't know who you can trust. </p> (laughs) </p> (laughs) </p> Yeah. </p> (laughs) </p> Yeah (laughs). Um, yeah it was just so strange to be genuinely expected to do one of those two things. </p> And for something inside me not to understand why I wouldn't want to. Or just say oh, well that's just laziness. You don't really care about your ideals or the truths you know. Um...</p> Yeah, and so judgmental. </p> With my choices and the compromises that I make because I think they are probably the safest...</p> ...thing I actually could be doing in practical terms. </p> (pause) Yeah, I mean having had like a month or so of normalcy, it's, ya know, it's weird thinking about those times. </p> And there's definitely a desire to sort of like whitewash that period of my life and say oh, those things weren't really happening and sort of exaggerating the memory or...</p> ...but then ya know that also seems very dangerous and like it would be like the way not to learn the lesson for many of us. </p> Yeah. And the progression from the hamster to the starfish was interesting because...</p> ...the hamster was so relatable. </p> I really like felt for that hamster and felt very bad for putting this like...</p> ...beautiful, intelligent creature in a little cage. </p> And I could understand everything I was feeling. </p> And I...</p> (laughs) Yeah. Yeah, and I was like genuinely like very sorry that I couldn't communicate to it that I just didn't want it to starve, but then with the starfish I mean they really weren't relatable. </p> Because they were things that had changed in nature and grown and mobilized while I was away and that made is much scarier (laughs). </p> (laughs) </p> Thank you. You too. I'll send you an e-mail. </p> Yeah, and I can mail you a check. </p> Bye. </p> You too. [0:43:38.7] </p>",1

It'll take you down to the basement but won't let you out on the first floor without a code. </p> No, um, so this is the first time I've actually been locked out on the way in. </p> But on the way out, the elevator always takes me to the basement...</p> ...instead of the lobby. </p> Okay. [0:01:26.5]</p> (writing) okay. </p> Right, something like that. </p> Okay, I will give that a try. </p> Okay. (pause) (sighs) Okay. Um, (pause) (inaudible at 00:02:17].5) be (sighs) I think it's because I'm having a...I was having a not a great day. And after reading a (inaudible at 00:02:29].6) in our office I was trying to do something, um (pause) and I felt like super stressed and just like I don't know I couldn't...I felt like I couldn't cope with doing anything. So I did what I usually don't do at work, which is I took a Valium to see if that would like ease everything out...which it did. Um, because I don't take it during the work day it was very weird. Like usually I've taken it when I'm at home lying down or some other (inaudible at 00:03:12].0). Um, really, really I felt like probably disconnected from like emotions and feelings for the rest of the day. Which, I mean, I'm sort of attributing to Valium but it might just have been me (inaudible at 00:03:33].2). It was really odd, not (pause) it was definitely not enjoyable. Like I finished the work day. I didn't freak out during my afternoon meeting or someone's being on my case about quickly selling software. So that was good. Um, but like I'm home. I said mmm...I don't really feel like eating cuz I was watching TV and I was, (inaudible at 00:04:09].0) I don't watch this show. Because she's obsessed with Breaking Bad.</p> And I was just like mmm...can't really concentrate on anything else and (inaudible at 00:04:20].1) so I was like mmm, can't go there. Ashby kind of putting me in her bedroom and saying sit on the bed. Alright. Like I read my book and I was playing with the cat but I don't know. I just felt sort of like slightly like next to myself doing that. </p> Like it was really, really flat. </p> Usually I just fall asleep or usually I'm so upset that I either just sort of lie still and stare at the ceiling, or I fall asleep. Or I kind of lie on the sofa and listen to like a documentary or something. Um, I usually don't probably do anything. Um, there hasn't been before where I haven't wanted to eat. Um, or that I haven't wanted to make a decision about what to eat, that I don't feel very hungry. Which is also really weird. Um, it just made for a very strange evening that I didn't like. But I also like half the time was just going mmm...this is weird. I should probably care about it, but I don't. Um, so I was even kind like out of it when friends of mine brought me over (inaudible at 00:05:56].1), which was a new thing. </p> Um, and like while that was amazing, really awesome and exciting it was still kind of like ohh, ya know and um I didn't realize (inaudible [00:06:14].7) I thought it was is that how it feels, really different from sort of trying to avoid like being upset? </p> Um, and I've been talking to my friends about sort of avoiding and repressing difficult emotions cuz you didn't want to have them. Um, and I was like well, yeah but I feel like I kind of know that I'm still upset. Like even if I'm sort of busy. Like no, actually I'm not upset or (inaudible at 00:07:01].2) other things. Like I still knew that something was going on. </p> Well, with this it was just like, I don't know...such a weird disconnect. Um, and also like not how I felt taking any other psychiatric medication. And thought this was sort of really divorced. I mean I think just taking Valium in my bed is probably something I'm going to stick to, because that whole evening was so weird and the day was weird and uh...</p> I think it was kind of a combination. Like it made it easier to sort of like disconnect from how I felt and just stay disconnected from my (inaudible [00:08:16].7). Um, though sometimes when I feel really disconnected from my body or from how I feel it's usually not super....like it doesn't last a very long time. Um, and this was, ya know, kind of half a day. (pause) Um, the other thing which I couldn't...I don't remember if I actually mentioned this or not, um so when I got home I was talking to Ashby about um (inaudible at 00:09:03].2) and this whole thing...</p> ...and she had seen that it happened (inaudible at 00:09:10].0) whatever. Um, and so her first response was like well, you know, you were kind of aggressive and this person didn't like, ya know...you don't know you and like this whole thing like maybe you shouldn't have come out swinging that hard or without context and (pause)...I know but I was thinking...what I was thinking about was so you know, let's say a dozen or so friends, probably (inaudible at 00:09:49].5) and that wasn't anything. Like it was not even a hey, that was kind of weird having your (inaudible at 00:10:06].7) in a while or like oh! Like, like sort of just dead silence. Um, and then the nondead silence was Ashby telling me that I should have been nicer. I should have strategize more. I should have planned thing. Um, and I think that's one of the things that was really upsetting (inaudible at 00:10:35].0) is that like how I might feel about this, whether I might feel kind of out of it or I might feel sad or upset or angry. Like, it's happened and I cared. It's just that no one said anything. I mean it was like silence so like who knows. </p> But, it felt really...it felt like (inaudible at 00:11:08].0) and it felt like...I don't know for some reason Ashby talking to me about how I should have faced things when I got home just made me really feel like yeah! Ya know what? So usually I saw that and other people like you sort of like had this weight. How come everyone saw that and didn't say anything? Especially since because social media and like attention with friends like it's not uncommon for um like someone to e-mail about something...like oh, I saw that on Facebook or Twitter or on a blog, whatever, and it was really sucky. Like there's often cross chat. Um...</p> Ya know. </p> Yeah. Oh yeah. Like I mean among other things um like Jen um, like I can't stand her, which a lot of people, a lot of my friends know, and so there's kind of that and like I don't know, like random people, random of my friends will also sort of like pop off about something and so I'm like oh! I see that, you know could just...I don't know...(inaudible at 00:12:55].8) a lot and it was odd to have a like minor dust up with someone and have no one say anything. Like even a what the hell, were you really grumpy? Ya know. (pause) And I think what I kind of wanted was someone to (inaudible at 00:13:28].4)...I really wanted someone to say that wow, he was really kind of a jerk. Um, or uhh, it's kinda, that's annoying. And if (inaudible at 00:13:41].4) and a couple friends of mine and my (inaudible at 00:13:47].5) partner shared it and they were all like wow! I mean they were like after sort of me (inaudible at 00:13:53].0) they were like gosh, she's a jerk. I can't stand her. But I don't know. I didn't want to have to do that part. Like (sighs)...like reaching out to kind of...</p> Yeah. Like or something. Um, like not even necessarily like chiming in like support. Just kind of like a hey! What's up? Hello. Sort of having a rough day people. Um (pause) And so one of my friends had said that um, (inaudible at 00:15:15].6) she's like oh, you had so many people commenting on it (inaudible at 00:15:16].7) you find depressed, like obviously you have a lot of people supporting you. And I was like mmm...I just think the numbers are irrelevant. Like um (pause) having a lot of followers or commenters doesn't...I don't know. The number doesn't really do anything for me. Like I don't...I don't really care. Like I want my friends to read what I'm saying but kind of beyond that I'm like stuff, like people reading it. Like most of the...instead of talking Internet I (inaudible at 00:16:14].8) (pause). It's kind a metaphor for like people who vaguely know me and like sometimes I might write something that's like for, like a public audience or a wider audience, but generally (inaudible at 00:16:27].1) probably two years or so. Um, so (inaudible at 00:16:38].3) I'd be like wow, I have a lot of followers on Twitter and I know a lot of them. Like a lot of my friends are here. What the fuck. Like where were you in this time of upset, aggravation and Twitter stupidity. Except that's not really Twitter, it's like (pause) I mean it's not like I'm having (inaudible at 00:17:03].6) beef with Jen due to like Twitter, follow her accounts (inaudible at 00:17:10].7). No, this is an actual thing. (pause) [0:18:13.4]</p> Mm hmm. [0:19:40.3]</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah, I mean...</p> No, like I don't.</p> Yeah. I mean I feel like (pause) (inaudible at 00:22:25].7) that I say I'm feeling X and the next question will be but why? And that why not meaning my God, what happened today? But, ya know, just if I or...just by yourself. Um...(pause) </p> Yeah. I mean one of the...one of the things I was thinking about was also like (sighs)...I don't know. Like (sighs) I guess sort of like being like uh...I mean the (inaudible at 00:24:50].9) um, which is like I remember (inaudible at 00:24:59].1) will always have to work harder and like dress like more conservative and blah, blah, blah, and also (inaudible at 00:25:10].5) take out all the drag queens and (inaudible at 00:25:11].9) people. It's like they're just like in our house. Um, so that is basically, ya know, how my friends raised me to be. Like (inaudible at 00:25:33].6) when I was younger. Definitely (inaudible at 00:25:38].7) when I was like in middle school, high school, college. Like (inaudible at 00:25:46].7) matters. Like that's just not what matters, how people perceive you but also you know it's like not, like not raising your voice, not being visibly angry or upset. Um, (inaudible at 00:26:09].6) will be okay but like not I guess expressing (inaudible at 00:26:15].9) or anything that could be negative. (inaudible at 00:26:22].6) Um, so it's hard not to...I mean I'm often surprised that people are able to be um...not surprised is the word, um (inaudible at 00:26:50].6) when people are like super emotional and sort of like (inaudible at 00:26:59].7) where I don't, like...I don't know. It just seem like really (inaudible at 00:27:09].9) so like that I don't feel they really miss vulnerable and not inappropriate but I guess...I still could have done something that I shouldn't do. Um, and there would be negative repercussions if I did. And so that it's hard to get over um...it's also with Josie (sighs). Although she would be very emotional, she didn't like me to be. I think she would get upset. Um, and also like you know more towards the end of our relationship (sighs) if I got...I was upset or angry she would often like kind of one-up me on it or like well, you being upset made me upset, or you saying that has just triggered a flashback, or you so...or like we couldn't talk because I was being too angry or too aggressive or too violent or whatever, so tried to talk to her. Probably the only way I could really talk to her is if I was...if I tried to say things as neutral as possible. Um, and also it felt like she was really upset and I was really upset about something that her upset mattered more or was more (sighs) I guess more of an immediate problem. Um, because her being very upset, ya know, there was a likelihood that she would like have a flashback or something else and says I'm leaving. But she doesn't even know where we were. Or completely checking out of everything and just (pause)...I don't know. Like it sort of ended with whatever reaction we were having. The other thing which I (inaudible at 00:30:39].0) but one of Josie's big things was using the free self-care to justify...everything. Like really selfish behavior. </p> Yeah. </p> Um, so like (inaudible [00:31:08].1) and she was like well, I can't do this because I need to engage in self-care. And I can't go to the grocery store. I can't...I need you to walk with me somewhere or just like...</p> ...(inaudible at 00:31:24].3) of everything that she did, and I still (inaudible at 00:31:32].4) when someone talks about self-care. Um, and I could have punched some mutual friends of ours who I saw or something with (inaudible at 00:31:46].3) I really hate that word self-care now. Like it's hard to hear that and not think you're being a selfish, horrible person. Um, I think that's one of the things that can make me feel stressed out doing therapy more frequently because it feels like is this the...I don't know. If it's still like kind of like back of the mind, is this is the beginning of like narcissistic, selfish horribleness. Um, and even though I can (inaudible at 00:32:33].2) right now, I'm pretty sure (inaudible at 00:32:33].8) it's still like, like that's what self-care reminds me of. Like self-care reminds basically of Josie being really demanding and selfish and horrible and me having to sort of like (inaudible at 00:32:54].8), give up whatever I was doing or feeling to pay attention to her. So (pause) I try not to think like no, that's not what we're doing and that's not what we're talking about, but it always comes up. </p> Yeah. I mean I think one of the things about being explicit about how I feel is that (sighs) like I'm scared that someone will...I'm scared things (inaudible at 00:34:48].1) or shot down or (sighs) like having someone (inaudible at 00:34:53].7) talking to you like focus on like something that's not important or like not really relevant to what I'm talking about. </p> And (inaudible at 00:35:04].1) or like focused on (inaudible at 00:35:04].8) and like I don't really care about that part. The part that I care about is the part where I was really scared. I was really angry. </p> I don't know. It sort of feels like a (inaudible [00:35:04].8). Like they don't want to do. Um, also (inaudible at 00:36:25].6). Um, and I guess it, it doesn't really matter that you have it (inaudible at 00:36:38].1). It still feels like it's a possibility. Um, and also (inaudible at 00:36:52].0) there are also things that are um (inaudible at 00:36:59].6) that are ritualized or sexualized or (inaudible at 00:37:02].1) that, um I'm really used to like 99 percent of the time getting a negative reaction. So it's really hard to like oh not at this time. She'd say fine. Um, and I think that (sighs)...I think this is where I feel more (inaudible at 00:37:31].7) or also this is where I particularly want to like describe or show not tell because...I mean just because it's so many times having people say but no, but like having had so many arguments...</p> ...about that.</p> And I don't know. It just feels like easier to just say alright. It's gonna be another like...I don't even think about it most of the time. It's just sort of like that's how we've been talking about it. </p> And it's a surprise when I don't have to sort of I guess lay the groundwork (inaudible at 00:38:23].7) (pause) </p> No, I think it is. I don't know. I mean (inaudible at 00:40:18].9) think about is how, uh, (inaudible at 00:40:28].5) response to compliments (inaudible at 00:40:31].4).</p> Um, and I think that (inaudible at 00:40:32].4) I'm just gonna say thing and then just say thank you. And I still most like...I still (inaudible at 00:40:48].8) reflexively in my head, like (inaudible at 00:40:51].4) but, um, I don't know being aware of like, being aware of it was, was a very weird time for this period of time being aware that I was doing it. </p> And feeling I couldn't stop. Um, and I don't think that's...I mean it's not like I feel like I can't stop reframing things. </p> Um, (pause) so most of time I just don't think about it. </p> Yes. [0:41:57.6] </p>",2
1004687678.txt,"Well admission (ph) was 50 bucks an hour, which I mean that's not—right? And supposedly my transportation costs—got it down to a dollar I think? Okay? yeah hold on to the same states.</p> Oh it's fine. It's fine. Oh gosh. So speaking of finance for really good things—I wanted to talk to you about something that I'm really frustrated about and I'm trying to figure out exactly how it goes off this.</p> I think I mentioned to you that just in general, go smoother if he gets out the door at the same time as I do because he just to leave opportunity of problems happening, and then him not going to work. [00:01:12]</p> He's concerned that if he says that, he sounds like he's trying to make excuses. (Pause) so he's concerned with that. For example if for some reason—part of this potential contract would be that if he doesn't do this, because he has to do something to take care of me, I would specifically see that that's what it was and not him, so he doesn't lie about it.</p> But I have no problems with giving to charity. It's not that. It's just that we're losing what—a thousand dollars a month right now. And so, is it unreasonable for me to independently say that this is actually a really bad idea?</p> Okay.</p> Okay.</p> He can even donate his time.</p> I mean have to do an hour or two hours for every time he doesn't go to work, volunteering at a charity. I don't mind that. But it's just if it comes to financial things it will directly affect me more than him.</p> Yeah.</p> He's really very open about [inaudible at 00:03:50].</p> Yeah, the thing of it is that part of the reason why it's being done this way is because he is now finally open about the fact, to certain people, that he will lie about it. For example, he even said if he did enter this agreement,—my husband said, ""I would have to call from the number of my lab so you can check numbers of where I intend to be at. Or I [inaudible at 00:04:13] days when I'm not going to be able to call in to show that I've been there by 9:00 A.M."" So he's even really open about the fact that he potentially would evade it.</p> Yeah, because that one doesn't affect him as much as me. And—</p> If he had an easy way of being able—he doesn't have as many skills to even pick up additional income. For example, I mean although I pulled a lot of family favors to do this, they could not do this for me if I didn't actually have the credentials and the ability to do this. [00:05:08]</p> Because that was something that's really been bothering me. I am really happy that he is (pause) addressing this though, because (pause), it is true that (pause) there are things that basically make—if you set yourself up to succeed, often things—they may not succeed in things, but if you start the day out right, you can usually have things go smoother. [00:07:09] Okay?</p> Some people lay their clothes out, some people do this.</p> But if he can get in the door—</p> Yeah, or even just—the thing is, is that it starts this—if he gets stuck there, it starts this terrible spiral of feeling bad about himself, therefore acting out, therefore then becoming altered, and so the more you get into this, and not going to work. The whole thing starts.</p> I don't give those to myself. I can't. Most of them I can't into [inaudible at 00:09:22]. He is in every single shot. That is (pause)—that shows, at least on some level that he has the ability to have consistency on something. It's just a matter of redirecting things. He isn't hopelessly unorganized such that he can't do it. I think that it also shows that he rip off (ph) that kind of stuff. You know?</p> I actively avoid getting the shots. So—</p> Yep. I know it's (pause), it's called [inaudible at 00:10:11] because once you get in a lot of shots, you start getting directions and reactions. And then you start having to map just to make sure you don't get injections in the same place to often.</p> It's (pause) just, yeah—he manages all that and that pretty damned amazing. So that shows—I'm not just saying it to say oh, look he has redeeming values. What I'm trying to show is that he can plan and deal with something that, not complicated, but something that you consistently do on a regular basis. [00:11:00]</p> I mean that every time, I have the work, I've had something, or just one of those things where you're so concerned about doing the right that everything else gets in the way, which is—I mean he's taking it seriously though. [00:12:12]</p> I mean—a way (ph) [inaudible at 00:12:36] where they know. </p> I mean ho to change is always hard—.</p> No matter what you do. And—(pause) </p> Yeah, for anybody doing massive amount of changes. I do know one of the things he was super proud of at one point, is that—a long time ago his dad made a promise that he had no intension of fulfilling, but the concept was that he needed to go to a hundred meetings and do this, and do that. And then maybe he would consider sending him to San Diego, or wherever.</p> Not that they did not help him, I mean he went to years of meetings and that sort of, but just to know that the act of doing that wasn't going to necessarily get the pay off of getting the help that he needed, that it was a shell game. Seeing this that he either would not be able to do it or not dare to call out on this kind of thing.</p> Maybe, or that he would grow out of this. His dad still thinks it's some sort of character defect that he just needs to get over (pause), sometimes. I mean it varies a lot (pause). [00:15:35]</p> ...You know. Um, there is behavior that, for some reason, they [can't understand] (ph) that they don't expect people to, like, think about the ramifications. Like, Dave and I, when we were about 18, we were listening to his little brother, who was like maybe 12 or 13 at the time, calling his sister [his sister or somebody] (ph) and they were screening the phone calls, and it was him, and they wouldn't answer 'cause they just didn't feel up to talking to him. Now, this was blatantly obvious to Dave and I, that, from now on, that if we call and we don't reach somebody, there's a chance that we're being screened, as well. [00:17:09] </p> Yeah, this was back in the '90s when you could hear the voice—the conversation of the thing, yeah. </p> And so we were thinking to ourselves, ""Well, I guess, if that—if we see this happening, then that means that, equally, that could be something else like that."" So it is not—to think [everything about me] (ph). I wasn't around, was a—with a grain of salt. And so, um, there is a lot of that kind of behavior, where they do things for other people in the family and, for some reason, don't expect that's going to sink in that this is favoritism or this is strange behavior—you know?—and it is kind of weird. </p> Yeah, or they don't expect you to think far enough back. [00:18:00] </p> Dave's mom—who said she wasn't certain if, you know—that she could come visit Dave and hasn't seen him since, like, 2005, 2006, blah, blah, blah—um, she heard at the yarn shop that she was working at, the owners retired and closed the shop, whatever...</p> ...And so she is now not working, and she is taking a—she called Dave while driving up [slaps surface]—driving to the West coast—she's in [pauses] Idaho?—to take a trip for a week or something like that, to take a vacation, like looking at the scenic places there. I don't know if she realizes that, like, Dave can remember three months back when she said that she had no money, and she just, like, talked three days back or three weeks back about how she was concerned about how in the world she was going to, you know, make ends meet, and then taking a vacation. </p> And that coast, although it seems—if you haven't been out there, it is exceptionally expensive.</p> Yeah, that area right around the California border there ... [00:19:02]</p> ...It is all tourists.</p> So, like, going to see the things like that, it is a very expensive area. </p> We were horrified that it was, like, slightly cheaper to eat, like, non-Manhattan, New York than it was out there. </p> You know? Yeah. Like, it was [inaudible] and, you know, Brooklyn seemed like a really good bargain. </p> So that's—you know, 'cause it is all tourists. </p> Yeah. And so, um—and it is varied like that. You know, it is all Shakespeare festivals and fancy yarn shops and all this other stuff like that. </p> And so, um, I don't know if she put two and two together. Also, she sent us construction pictures of the new [bath. I found out] (ph) she had, like, an armoire built into the wall with the new house and all this stuff. [Slaps surface] I don't think she actually thinks that he put all this together and sees, ""Wow, look at all the stuff, and yet you say you can't some see me."" You know? [Pauses] And, um, that's part of—that's the reason why I don't even try to talk to them anymore. [00:20:11]</p> You know? Aside from the fact that I feel like every contact I have just sort of falls into the ocean, I don't get enough back from them to figure out what's going on. Like...</p> ...Letters, phone calls, texts, that kind of thing—nothing. Occasionally, they tell him something, which doesn't always get back to me...</p> ...Which is even weirder. It is like, yep, sending an e-mail about a phone call that I made is like never doing it... </p> ...'Cause he'll never remember to send it to me. </p> But that's a pretty rare thing that that even happens. So [pauses]—but it is just—it is very—you know, and it is, quite frankly—I mean, it is none of our business, but don't pretend to do one thing and not do another. You know?</p> I don't even necessarily think she thinks she's lying; I think that she convinces herself at that period of time. </p> But I don't think she's really—wants to give a good, hard look on her life. You know?</p> I resent her because she's put me in the [slaps surface] horrible, horrible position of being both his mother and his wife. </p> I never wanted it to be that way, but, you know, from [these reaching on] (ph), she—even earlier than that, obviously, she's not so interested. You know?</p> And I don't really understand why she called them half to—from the halfway point of driving out on her vacation to make sure, like, everything is OK, but he didn't know she was having a vacation. That's—I have done that when my parents were taking long drives, they, like, say, ""Oh, call me when you're halfway to wherever, just so we know that you're OK."" But they know ahead of time that I'm taking a trip. [00:22:08] </p> You know, he didn't know anything about a trip. </p> You know? And that's also a child-parent—maybe that's not true; I don't know. Maybe I'm saying this the wrong way, but, I mean, my parents don't call me to tell me they're halfway driving anywhere. If—it seems like it is a reversed kind of thing. </p> But this whole thing kind of let down because I meddle—I try not to meddle a whole lot with this whole thing, and I mentioned the fact that—to him that, ""You know, whenever your mom—like, whenever you tell your mom that you've been depressed, which you—it takes you a long time to actually say this, she freaks out and gets off the phone. She either changes the subject, or she freaks out and gets off the phone."" And I said, ""Why don't you ever talk to her and tell her about that?"" And he's like, ""Well, 'cause I'm sure she doesn't know what to say."" And I said, ""Well, you know, she can either talk to friends and find out what depressed people want to hear when they say they're depressed, or she can freaking Google it."" I'm sure, if you put in ""what to say to a friend or family member that is depressed,"" she will probably get more than one result. You know, it is not like these are things that are hard for her to understand, and she [used to teach] (ph) technology. [00:23:16]</p> Yeah. I mean, I have actually done this. I mean, when I've had situations—like, I need to go and write a card to somebody who had been diagnosed with cancer...</p> ...And I struggled, and I talked to a couple of people I knew, and I realized that the people I knew that had cancer at the time, it really wasn't as relevant 'cause it was, you know, this and that. So I actually went and spent some time on the Internet, and there were lots of places that will actually tell you how to properly word...</p> ...Things like that to say something. You know?</p> Yeah. </p> I would at least say, ""I don't know what to say. Please, I'm trying to figure it out."" I don't necessarily have to tell you what to tell me to say.</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. </p> And so, like—and we finally called her back, um, which was really hard for him to do, to say this to her, and she's like, ""Well, whatever. I don't know what to say, and whatever I say, it feels like fake stuff."" And then she sort of threw her father under the bus for this, like saying that—like, I'd never really feel comfortable saying 'I love you' 'cause it sounds so fake—you know, 'cause her father never said it, but yet, you know, this and that, and so it was passed on to her. That's kind of bullshit. She may have never actually said those actual words in that order, [slaps surface] but nobody—I know that he loves me. Like, I've never—by his actions and by everything that he does in his life, you know that. And I can't even necessarily say that he hasn't ever said it to me; um, I just don't have any memory of it, but that's—so throwing him under the bus by saying that is very different because he [pauses] had a lot of actions that made you feel very, you know, cared for. [00:25:18]</p> You know? Um, so, you know, uh, [slaps surface] [pauses] that's kind of like so then she threw somebody else under the bus for her own, like, lack of giving a damn. I really just don't think she gives a fuck about any of it. I think that, when she's put on the spot, which, unfortunately, I feel like I set him up to do that 'cause I kind of pushed Dave to put her on the spot for this. Even though he said this is things he wanted to do, but he never even thought of them as possibilities because he was afraid of, like, putting her in a situation where she would freak out and all and not do anything. Um, even then, she, you know, doesn't really have any strong feelings about this. You know? [00:26:08]</p> It is very creepy. And so it is [pauses for four seconds]—it is very distressing. The other thing that's kind of distressing about this whole thing—and this is how it relates to me...</p> ...Is that Dave spoke briefly to his mother about the fact that, like, [pauses] communication being an issue, and, apparently, his mom did not know that his sister and him hadn't spoken to each other since graduation, when she called me a drama queen and all this crap. I don't think that's true. I think that she isn't—I think that words were never passed to her, but she had to have put two and two together and figured out that they hadn't spoken. </p> Anyways, Dave was mentioning the fact that—just briefly to her while trying to say why her behavior is causing this problem, like to make her face this. He was like, ""You know what? Honestly, you're passing this stuff on. This is the behavior your—my sister idolizes you. She sees all this stuff happening. I don't speak to her because of this and that, because I need to set boundaries, and now I don't even know my own grandch—or my own nieces and nephews."" [00:27:16]</p> Like, pointing out that this is, like—these are—they may not be direct consequences, but this is where the consequences are going towards. </p> And she's, like, ""Well, why don't you call them?"" Like, ""I'll give you their cell phone numbers."" So she's supposedly going to provide us with the cell phone numbers, but I am really—and as much as I love my nieces and nephews, I am really reticent to pick up the phone and call them on their cell phones 'cause I'm concerned that that is [sighs] [pauses]—I don't know how to explain this, but I—the parental [sighs] [pauses]—I am concerned about circumventing parental, like... </p> ...Like, you know, whatever. There was a period of time when my mom and my aunt fought about everything. You know, they just did as sisters. My aunt was born here; my mom wasn't, so, quite frankly, they don't have (ph) the same family members; they have different world views and different world backgrounds in terms of that kind of thing, all—you know, nearly all this—you know, not youngest (ph) but you know all this stuff—my Aunt, who is still—I feel very close with, actually. Um, but the thing is, is that, even when they didn't get along, I spent a lot of time talking to my aunt. But the thing is, is that, because I already had an established relationship with her as being my Auntie, it was not—there was no, like, breach of—of, you know, like parental consent, I guess? Because in no way did my mom ever see to think that these spats that they had as—as sisters as being something that affected me, because it was more about, you know, holding up, ""I've lived life differently than you have, and you don't see perspectives as this."" This is not about, like—this is not the same thing at all; this is—it is a very different kind of—if—strangely, it is actually more sisterly normal, like, fighting stuff... [00:29:08]</p> ...Than, like, this kind of stuff, where it, like, [slaps surface] you know. I—and so I don't know why, but I just feel very, very uncomfortable doing this. And I'm wondering if my discomfort with it is actually founded, I guess, or if I'm just making...</p> ...Excuses not to get to know them. </p> I don't—it is not even just like me being worried about redemption; I mean, it is beyond that. </p> I have no idea what they know or don't know. </p> You know, and I'll exude (ph), ""Hi, it is Auntie Debra! How have you been? I know we haven't spoken in years and years.""</p> Um, Gemma is thirteen. </p> Not the oldest. </p> Aiden is eleven. </p> And Katrina, whom I've actually physically never met, though I've heard a lot about—she is seven. And they all have their own phones, and so I could text them or whatever, I guess. </p> [Slaps surface] Or...</p> Yeah!</p> Especially because of the fact that his sister got a little bit creeped out by the fact that, like, when she—when she found out that Dave—like, his—you know, his preference for pornography [blunt that edge] (ph) of kids...</p> ...It started at the rough age of Gemma. </p> You know?</p> I could definitely see this becoming a problem. </p> Or at least—I can definitely see that, if she felt like having a little bit of drama, she could make this into a problem, if that makes sense. </p> Um, I don't think it would ever be a problem 'cause Dave doesn't—like, the nature of his problem doesn't actually want to be attached to human beings and people. </p> These could be computer-generated images entirely, and it would be perfectly fine. [00:31:02]</p> Um, I don't think that they'll ever understand that, but, um, even just with me, I don't want to cause problems with the kids and their parents. And so, I guess, what I probably feel like I want to do is, if I want to have a relationship, maybe find an intermediary to find out if it is OK. </p> You know? But the problem is every member of the family is freaking nuts, so I—I don't know what to do. </p> [Chuckles] I mean...</p> I am actually thinking about finding an independent friend of the family to do this for me, because I don't think I've ever done—sent (ph), whatever, I never get anything back. </p> Or if she even—like, she could have a filter so that, if it comes from me, it is dumped in spam or something. I don't know. </p> Yeah, yeah. </p> I have no idea. </p> To be honest, it could be [pauses]—[sighs] because I have no way of—to be able to determine it, I have no way of finding out how much is read, or even to start it, or not even seen, or whatever. </p> So, like I said, I'm trying to think about, like, maybe finding somebody. Maybe a—you know, Dave's—Dave's mother or sisters' kids, maybe cousins, maybe, to ask about this, or a family friend to talk to Ker—Kerry and say, ""Hey, Debra really wants to get to know them. Is it OK if she—she contacts them?""</p> Because I really feel like, me even indirectly—and it is not like a, ""I'm afraid to talk to her."" I mean, I am afraid to talk to her, but I don't ever get anything back so it is like—it is just setting myself up for not hearing anything. </p> Yeah. Yeah, I have had... [00:33:01]</p> I have financially given them things that—and never gotten a response about it, either. </p> You know? Like, you know, kids don't have any—you know, ""Don't have any money for the kids to have any clothes."" Sent gift cards—nothing. I don't even know if I—you know, unless I kept the receipt to be able to check to see if the gift card still had a balance on it, I wouldn't even know if they used it or threw it away. </p> But do you know what I mean?</p> It is that kind of...</p> ...Wall. And I've actually, a couple of times, told myself not to look... </p> ...Because it is better for me not to know. </p> They use them. </p> I am perfectly good for my money. </p> And they actually are, unfortunately, deluded into thinking that I have unlimited resources. I'm pretty sure of it at this point. </p> I'm pretty sure that they think that I am being funneled cash from my parents. [00:34:01] </p> It is the only thing that makes sense as to why they [pauses] abandon Dave the way they do. </p> I'm—the only thing I can think of is that, you know, the reason why—because my parents have stepped in and done things in lieu of parents for Dave...</p> ...I am convinced that they think that I'm getting money from—as a couple, that we get money from my parents. </p> I think they [wouldn't nag] (ph). They wouldn't tell me things like, ""The kids don't have clothes that fit them.""</p> I wouldn't get...</p> Of course!</p> I haven't—I haven't [this hasn't happened in years] (ph) but [sure have seen them, though] ph...</p> ...But back in the days, you know, like the whole thing of, ""Oh, my gosh, you know, Gemma is finally starting kindergarten, and she had a growth spurt and now, like, the sundresses that went down to her knees now barely covers her butt,"" blah, blah, blah, you know. [00:35:00]</p> Yeah, things are very casually said to me. Like, her saying, you know, something along the lines of, um, you know, ""I can't really afford a place,"" that kind of thing, and it is like, well, when I'm being told that her child doesn't have decent clothes, I'm not—you know, of course I'm going to step in and do something if I could. </p> They're asking. </p> But I don't think that they would say that if they didn't think the money was coming from my parents. </p> Which it is not. </p> I don't even like to get money from my parents for anything. You know? And I think maybe the reason why I don't like to ask it from them is because of—possibly because of the fact that people think of us (ph) that way—you know?—because everyone assumes I get it, so I don't want to. </p> I don't want to. Um, if things ever got dire—sure. You know, like if Dave really, you know, had a situation where he was in an accident, and we had no way to pay for our rent—absolutely, I would—you know, or something like that. [00:36:08]</p> But I think that, you know, it is important for me to figure—to struggle and figure it out for myself. </p> And I never wanted it that way. And so I think that maybe it is the fact that the assumption has made it that way. </p> That I'm even more so, like, unwilling to take the money. You know? When Dave graduated—or, actually, when he defended (ph), my parents paid to have a party catered for him, um, right after—like, basically while he was—the [public core] (ph) of the things happened, we set things up, that kind of thing, and we decided, for better or worse, how he did, you know, we're going to celebrate the fact that he put his effort into it; you know, that way he didn't feel that bad about it. </p> His dad showed up with his brother. My parents paid for everything. You know. [00:37:00]</p> Um, why? Because, well, until, like, the last minute, we didn't even know if his parents were—if his dad was going to come. But, certainly, he had no offer of anything, you know, and so I guess, in their way, they see this as, you know, for Dave's thirtieth birthday, paid—you know, [slaps surface] it was a surprise party paid for by my parents. You know? Um, [pauses] I think that they think that that's just—that there's like some unlimited tunnel of money that comes to—into our bank accounts. </p> And, therefore, you know, nobody needs to take care of him. Or at least I think that that's how they justify it in their heads. </p> Whether or not that's the actual reason, as opposed to they don't give a damn, might be different. You know?</p> Yeah, [pauses] yeah. [Pauses] But, [pauses] it is, [pauses] [sighs]—it is really hard because it is—you know, it puts a strain on my family, not financially, per se, about those kinds of things, but it is very difficult to have to make—you know, not make excuses but, occasionally, you have to, like, say something about it. You know, like—you know, well, what is—you're wondering (ph) is it their family for Christmas at some point; you know, really not. You know? We can't afford to, and if we could, it would be much more depressing than, you know, staying at home. </p> That kind of thing. </p> And I'm sure that they're getting the picture. Like, I'm sure that they got the picture, at least a little bit of it, before, but I think it is kind of—it is hard because I know that it hurts [slaps surface] my parents because they really, genuinely like Dave. [00:39:05]</p> Like, for—especially with, like, parties or whatever. You know?</p> Yeah. And I know that one of the things that he mentioned, to me at least, and that's something where it is just—it is very hard because, when you have someone in your life you love so much, and they're in so much pain. He was talking about the fact that, you know, him and the therapist were discussing the fact that he's never really grieved for the fact that his mother is not, like, interested in the least, really, about his life. [00:40:02]</p> And I don't—[pauses] especially 'cause I just don't understand why. You know? There's a difference between, like, having tough love with a bad kid and having somebody who has a Ph.D., is currently doing their postdoc at an Ivy League school. I mean, yes, he has problems, but [pauses] these things developed after they started pulling away. [00:41:03]</p> Like, [slaps surface] I think that on some level they're—maybe see it as, ""Oh, I need to pull away because he needs to figure these things out for himself."" Dave has not really ever crossed any boundaries with them, or asked them for money, or put them in situations where he had to be bailed out of jail. I mean, these are not the kind of things where you have to play these cards. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah, I could see that happening if—if Dave was like his brother Brad, who was an—honest-to-God—meth addict; who, you know, from watching Breaking Bad, now we, like, understand a whole lot more about his brother from watching, like, cable... [00:42:05]</p> ...That's not true but disturbing. Like, I can see having that kind of relationship with somebody who, you know, is...</p> Yeah, that's not what is happening.</p> No, he hasn't burned any bridges. </p> You know, he's never put it—he's never walked away from bail to have someone's house to be taken away. </p> That's not the same thing at all. </p> OK. </p> Yes, we're all scheduled. I'll be in Tuesday and Thursday. </p> Perfect. Thank you. </p> [Whispers] You, too. [00:42:40]</p>",3
1004600924.txt,"Oh, I'm sorry. [Chuckles] [Sounds as if getting adjusted] Thank you so much for that referral.</p> That was so helpful.</p> Um, I haven't spoken to her yet, but, [drops something] um — 'cause Chris's says [this does not come out] (ph) of his insurance. Uh, [pauses] but [yawns] I'm very [shifts in seat] happy. Um...</p> Call beforehand - absolutely.</p> OK. [Continues to fidget]</p> That's good. Um, [clucks] so I was trying to think last night about, um, [pauses] just about leaving and about — uh, mostly about, like, how I've progressed since coming here in - [slaps surface] I guess it was at the end of November, [clucks] and it just like — it is hard — I always have a hard time doing stuff like that, just in my head. Like I have to — that's why I came here, because I could — I couldn't just sort things out in my head, and I don't trust my gut a lot of times, and so what I've realized is that I need to —</p> [Fidgets] So I was able to do that and just, um, [pauses] — for them, and I could [feel then — then I'd get really free] (ph), but, of course, it is [a good that it] (ph) [sniffles] — the nearly free, leaving here and not still working with you is going to make me — not make it come back because — [clucks] but, like, I rely on coming here to keep me [sniffles] kind of [becomes emotional] [chuckles] regular?</p> Um, [pauses] [sounds emotional] and that just makes me nervous. I'm also just really - you know, my gut instinct really started was [sniffles] [becomes emotional] — like, I want to just work through this. You weren't pushing; like, I was nervous that people were going to say, ""You should just take some anti-anxiety medication. You should just take some antidepressants. You should just —"" - and maybe I should have and maybe it would have helped me, but I'm — I'm — where I am right now, I'm happy that I didn't [pauses] just because I would have felt like — I always would have thought I didn't do it on my — not on my own but, like, I know that I — my — just myself, I have the ability to help myself and make myself better on my own, without anything else. [00:07:58]</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm, even if it is a pill.</p> [Sniffles] Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm, yeah, absolutely. I'm so not good at that. I still don't, like — I don't know how to say it, but [pauses] I still don't picture my life as, like [pauses] — like, I still see things as just me, like just me going through on my own. Like, I don't see it as, like — like, I have to remind myself that I have a partner who's supposed to be like — I'm — because he does; he's great at supporting me. He — like, I call him, and he drops everything. Again, on Monday, he said, ""I'll be with — I'll leave school and come be with you if you need me to."" [00:10:02]</p> And — I don't know — it just doesn't make — it just — but still, I guess, what if I cried in front of my whole family at dinner or something. But [pauses] I don't know. Like, it even set — something happened a couple months ago. I was in an argument with one of my brothers, [pauses] and my brother said, [clears throat] ""Oh, my God, are you <i>cry</i>ing?"" And I just said, ""Yeah, I cry; that's what I do. I'm emotional. I'm upset and I'm frustrated right now, and when I feel that way, I cry. It's not that big of a deal."" [00:13:03]</p> ...And I just don't — and I need to be able to read people, and I need to be able to — like, I need to be able to know what they're thinking. But I think coming here and having it just being me pretty much. It may not be — for a long time, I really focused on, like, [slaps surface] [chuckles] trying to read you and trying to work through it. ""Hmm, [clucks] what does that mean? What does this mean?"" And, at a certain point, I just stopped doing that — not really stopped because I didn't [mutters] [inaudible at 14:56] going to shut off, but it just didn't matter as much; it just mattered more what I was saying and what I was thinking about things, [slaps surface] and I think that was one of the biggest things that helped me to feel more confident - was just like, ""Well, what do <i>you</i> think?"" - because I don't stop to do that much [slaps surface]. I don't — I'm — I don't stop to think — I'm so focused on, like, [inhales] in this situation, I act this way for this person, or read this person, and I just [slaps surface] should be relying more on my gut and my — I don't know. It was really helpful. It was really nice, um, and not what I would have come into this experience thinking I'd — I'd want.</p> I would have thought I [slaps surface] — I would have said, like, ""I need a lot of [chuckles] feedback. I need a lot of, like —"" — but I think that's what I want and not necessarily what I need. [00:16:05]</p> [Shifts in seat] Um, that [pauses] — I don't know. I've always had to — well, these conversations I actually had recently with my friends. [Clucks] Um, I said - I believe in total honesty and just — I don't trust other people, and I don't trust what they're telling me about myself, ever. And, um, [pauses] I don't know why a negative thing would seem like something I could trust, but it does. Um... [00:17:00]</p> Like, [chuckles] yeah, probab — not negative, like constructive. Like, um — like, [clucks] it sounds like — this is you talking — ""It sounds like you need to, you know — like you need to do this or —"" — um, or, ""It sounds like you're"" — I don't know [slaps surface]. I don't know, but yet I would trust, like, constructive criticism.</p> [Chuckles] Yes?</p> [Chuckles]</p> Yeah.</p> Oh, I liked that.</p> Yes. I react negatively, but I did actually — I thought it was really helpful for me.</p> Sorry I interrupted you.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> No, you definitely — the times you give feedback, it is impactful because I feel like I have a constant stream of thought that happens for 45 minutes, and I feel like you'll interject a couple times, and when it happens, I know it is meant to, like, draw me someplace or like —or to think about something else maybe a little differently.</p> And so it makes a difference.</p> [Clucks] But, yeah, I know that I react in a way that seems like — trust me, this is a big complaint of— of Chris's — I react in a way that seems like I'm pissed, because I usually am pissed. The nanny-sharing thing, I was pissed about. I did have a really hard time with that. [00:19:00]</p> But, um, that's a whole separate thing because I'm already really, um — I'm also just insecure about my job and what it is, and I always take it as, like — I just am already insecure about that whole situation. [Pauses] [Clucks] Yeah. But, yeah, I was saying to my friends recently, ""I would prefer [chuckles] everybody is just always completely honest, too. Like, I would prefer everyone was just blunt [slaps surface].""</p> And, uh, my girlfriend said to me a couple weeks later — she's like, ""I think you use that sometimes as a crutch to just say whatever you want.""</p> ""Like, sometimes, you just say, like, 'I'm just being honest', but you use it as a crutch to say mean things, and you just go about it as if, like, 'I'm just being honest'."" [00:20:01]</p> And I said, ""That's absolutely true,"" because it is. It is absolutely true. And, [rubs something], um, it is something [pauses] that I want to change. [Pauses] I do wish [people were] (ph) honest to me, but [chuckles] [usually like awful] (ph). I know that's — like, I know that I say that, and I probably wouldn't want it in real life. I say it and I just — but, ah — you know, like, Chris was complimenting me on something the other day. [Tuesday or Wednesday] (ph), we were all sitting around having dinner or something and chatting, and Chris was complimenting me on my — he says I — he sends a lot of things to me to proofread and to, you know, give him feedback on, and he says that I have really — that I'm a good writer and that I have a good writing style. And Emma said afterwards — said I was saying, like, ""No, no."" [00:21:00]</p> Mm-hmm, I guess so because, to me, that's true. And so [pauses] when someone says something that's supposed to be nice, it is just not true. Like, it is just not — like, I will — I just won't ever [chuckles] think it is — I think they're full of shit and that they're just, like, throwing me a bone, um, and that's something I guess I still need to work on. That's something I still really want to work on. [00:23:07]</p> Mm-hmm. [Fidgets]</p> Mm-hmm, that's true. Yeah, [rubs something] I didn't think of it that way. [Sighs] [Pauses for 11 seconds] Something I also do less of, but that hasn't gone away and I want to just keep working on is relating everything back to how that would make me measure up to being like or being different from my dad or my grandmother, or anyone on my dad's side of the family. [00:24:03]</p> Um, not taking in new information as, like — just not being able to take in a different perspective or a different point of view, or, um, [pauses for seven seconds] [clucks] not, [pauses] I guess, seeing a reality that isn't his own. And I think sometimes that I don't see a reality that isn't <i>my</i> own. [00:25:11]</p> Um, [pauses for seven seconds] so that felt (ph) some more. [Clears throat] [Pauses for five seconds] Hmm. [Slaps surface] [Makes squirrel-like sound] <i>Tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch</i>. [Shifts in seat] I don't know. [Pauses] I, uh, [pauses for eight seconds] I felt like, when I started coming here, also, I wasn't really angry anymore. Like I — I think I was still angry — I was angry at my mom, I think — and I'm angry at Caleb, or I was angry at Caleb. [00:26:08]</p> I said I think I just struggle with that a little bit. Um, [fidgets]... [00:28:02]</p> Mm-hmm? [Fidgets]</p> [Shifts in seat] Mm-hmm.</p> Right.</p> No. Well, and I feel like part of that starts with talking to my mom about just — I don't know — at least for me, I think that starts with talking [slaps surface] to her about what — how I was hurt by her and how I felt. I don't know. Just in my experience with talking to my friends recently about — like, my girlfriends [slaps surface] from high school about how I felt really hurt by those certain situations, and it just helps me to kind of move on from that and to not really pigeonhole them in these [pauses] places that we were? I don't know. If I could feel at least a little bit similar — if that situation was any indication of, like, letting go and moving on, that could happen with my mom, that I just think that it something that needs to happen.[00:30:00]</p> So I feel like it'd — yeah, [slaps surface] I need to kind of sort — there's a lot of little things I need to continue to just work through. [00:30:58]</p> It's so unhealthy</p> Mm-hmm.</p> They're their own people, yeah.</p> Absolutely. Well, and I just don't want to approach it that way. Like, I don't think that that's a healthy [pauses] way to enter [chuckles] into that next phase. I don't want it to be — like, they shouldn't carry any of my baggage. I know that that's impossible. I know everybody is going to take on something, but...</p> Right. [Sniffles]</p> Mm.</p> [Slaps surface]</p> Right. [Pauses] Yep. [Pauses for seven seconds] There's also — I mean, [sighs] yeah. There's just huge things that I do want to let go of beforehand, though.</p> [Shifts in seat] [Becomes emotional] Thank you. [Shifts in seat] [Clucks] [00:33:04]</p> [Says weakly] Thanks. [Shifts in seat] [Fidgets] [Begins to cry]</p> [Whispers] Thanks. [Continues to quietly cry] [Sighs] Yeah, I, uh, [pauses] — I feel good. I'm really grateful that this is [pauses] — you've helped me so much. I feel so much [sniffles] — I feel like a different person. I mean, not a different person because I don't want to be totally [chuckles] — but I feel like a much healthier version of myself. [Breathes in] This feels very good. [Rubs something] [Sniffles] [00:34:16]</p> Thank you. Um, but, like, that makes sense to me. That's logical. That's like, ""All right,"" just like, ""all right, let's like sort this out, and let's go through it,"" but then it also feels like [slaps surface] crippling. [00:37:05]</p> But it makes sense, and that's [sniffles] — it also just feels comfortable. That feels like, ""Yep, OK, [pauses] we should work it out this way, and let me tell you how. [Rubs something] But then, if you don't do, I'm going to be really [chuckles] upset."" [Sniffles] [Fidgets] That's something that still needs work with my family and Chris but doesn't exist as much with my friends. Like Emma was just making some real crummy life decisions yesterday, but they're her life decisions to make. That's — she asked my advice, and I told her honestly, without — I was very — I was trying very hard to be tactful; [clucks] I think I was. She — she could tell that I didn't agree with it, but, um, they're her life choices to [chuckles] make. [00:38:03]</p> [Clucks] It bothered me because there were — I saw a whole list of negatives. She had also painted this woman — the potential employer — to look like a lot — like a — like she had ratted Emma out, even though Emma had lied to both [slaps surface] the potential employer and her current employer. [Clucks] And so she wanted to, like, switch the blame. Oh, like, she had — she was saying, like, ""Can you believe that woman?"" And I was like — and I said to her, I said, ""Well, I could see how she could — why she would say that to the mom,"" who's the woman who's — Emma works for now. [00:40:04]</p> [Slaps surface] Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah.</p> [Sniffles] Yeah, definitely. I think that's a big problem with our friendship, in general. We have — we're very similar in those ways. We're both really insecure. We both like — we both make, kind of, decisions motivated by similar things, and, yeah, I think that [pauses] — yeah, possibly. I don't know what bothered me so much about it, [shifts in seat] but I just felt like it was fake. I felt like it was all, like, ""That's not true!"" Like, I just didn't — it didn't make any sense to me. [Pauses] I don't know. [Inhales] And then I tried to, like — I tried to put myself into her shoes when the mom, the woman that she works for, came home and said, ""So —"" — it is like a — I don't know — there are just like so many things [chuckles] wrong with it. [00:44:09]</p> And so it was like, ""You not only have a college degree. You just finished your <i>master's</i>, and you're just going to be a <i>nanny</i> like I am?"" Like, I <i>hated</i> that I couldn't do anything more. Like, I didn't hate my job, but I hated that that was my only option, that it felt like my only option. Granted, there were other options, but [pauses] I felt like I was in a position where this was the only job I had to make the amount of money that I needed to make — to support Chris and I, like, this was it. [00:45:05] [Clucks]</p> It is not honest, because someone who's doing something that makes them happy doesn't come home and complain for 30 minutes every day. [Slaps surface]</p> And I've got a — confused.</p> [Blows on something]</p> Oh, OK.</p> Yes? [Shifts in seat]</p> Oh, OK.</p> Thank you. That actually...</p> Yeah, that's very comforting.</p> OK.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> All right, thanks so much.</p>",2
1004600930.txt,"Yeah.</p> My name and stuff.</p> Okay. (pause) I guess I can talk about my weekend. (chuckle) It was okay. I mean, it wasn't...it was a weird time for me. I had an interesting experience and just food for thought I guess. I met...I stayed with Graham (sp) and I guess I went just to get away just because things were getting so oppressive and I was just constantly thinking about Victor staying at home and everything. My room reminded me of him so that's why I went. The whole time I still thought about him. (chuckle) [00:01:39]</p> Yeah, well I guess when we first met he was a librarian when I was a student at the university. I was just graduating. I was still with Jeremy and kind of breaking up with him and Graham (sp) said he had a crush on me and I said, ""Well, I'm in a relationship."" But then he was just so interesting and different that I just continued seeing him, hanging out with him, and at one point we were intimate. I think he kissed me and I gave him a massage (chuckle) in bed. It was just very short.</p> Yeah I just...seeing other people happy I guess makes me bitter. (chuckle) It's not good. (pause) [00:17:33]</p> Yeah, probably. I mean I do feel deprived a lot. I tend to think in those terms. A lot of people are deprived but they don't think like that. They focus on the positive. I don't tend to do that so that's precisely the reason I'm becoming so desperate about things, about writing, about sex. It's like, ""I'm still a virgin. That's must mean I missed out on this very, very important experience."" Whereas it doesn't have to be that way. There's lots of people who don't have sex and they are 30 or 40 and [they were all 25 as in this case] (ph). (chuckle) I mean, yeah, I shouldn't...yeah, I don't know why I think of everything in terms of that I've been deprived of stuff. [00:18:43]</p> Yeah, and just like one of my stories that I sent everywhere that was rejected by everybody. It's just like...it's ridiculous. I really don't have my head straight because I write crap and then I expect it to get published in the best places. I don't even take a step back and analyze that no, this is just getting worse and worse. I have certain strengths. I've been published before. I've won awards so it's not like I'm completely delusional that, ""Oh, I think I can write."" It's not like that, you know? (chuckle) I can do good stuff. I can write good stuff. I just need to have my head straight and think rationally about stuff and know that these are my strengths and this is what I should be writing and not just set myself up for greater and greater failures. [00:20:16]</p> Yeah, it's like this bad pattern where you know you're going to get hurt by something so you do more and more and more of it just to torture yourself. (chuckle) So I feel like that's what I'm doing. I write one draft and then I send it off and I'm like, ""Oh, I'm waiting for the call to come and them to say how lovely it is."" (chuckle) (pause) And people do say in their rejection that they like a lot of things, it's just not right for them is what they say. Which means it just needs a lot of revision. It just needs to go through several versions. That's all but if I could just be strong enough to do that, you know? [00:21:14]</p> I don't know. It was just a different time when I was in MSU and I had structure, I had teachers, I had deadlines, I had to write. I was just very, very motivated and driven and very confident. (chuckle) It sounds cocky right now but yeah, what I wrote my teachers loved and they approved and they approved it so much in class that I ended up alienating pretty much everyone. They played favorites a lot and...I sound so cocky right now. (chuckle) But that was the thing, the award...they give this (inaudible) award to the best student and they gave that to me and that was...I guess that, in a way, maybe it went to my head also. [00:22:46]</p> Yeah, it's been three years or longer.</p> Yeah, there was not...my parents have not really been that kind at all. My mom's nice enough and she loves me and we've been together since I was born but (pause) she's not really warm and friendly and giving the kind of approval and being the kind of parental figure parents usually are — being strong and being (pause)...I guess Victor (sp) was like that a lot which is why I like giving...like losing him is hurting so much. The first night when things started between us, the things that he was saying, he said this and this and he's like, ""Why are women always quoting me?"" But he said, ""You can always come to me, even if you kill someone, you know? You can still come to me. Things can never be that bad that you can never come to me."" I guess he said that when I said I was suicidal and he had just lost his cousin. [00:26:06]</p> (chuckle) Yeah.</p> I don't know. The first time I barged into his place that's what I said and he did reach out to me and he did put me on his lap and comfort me. It didn't work this time. (pause) I guess I always do have boyfriends who are father figures. This time around it was like even more even though I'm older. But he was just that strong to me or my image of him, the ideal of him was like that.</p> Yeah. What about (inaudible)?</p> Yeah, that's my understanding. (pause) Yeah, I mean...but then things are just even more complicated because he's David's (sp) friend and we both feel guilty. And my squeamishness in bed is really just me shutting down to him because first of all there's the David (sp) wall and second of all when he said, ""I'm polygamous and I don't...I love you but I'm not in love with you,"" that just kind of put me off and my body just kind of, in a way, it made a response but certain things shut down.</p>",0
1000060940.txt,"Back to that again.</p> Back to that again.</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. I suppose so. Keep me going for dinner. Woke up this morning and found out I didn't have a car to get to work with so I gave Tye my lunch money and he took me to work so I've been waiting on dinner. About to go crazy. Well, Tuesday with luck I get my first paycheck. Oh, yeah and that would mean that I'll probably be going just balls out to get to the bank so if I'm late it'll just be a few minutes because I've run to the bank to get my sob check cashed deposited. I don't know, I'm sure looking forward to pulling some money. </p> Yeah. It's just about three months night I think. God damn I never had any idea what I was getting into when I left the other job. I don't know whether it's the onset of money coming back in or what but I'm getting real over powering urges to be active about things again. I'm super anxious to get a little bit ahead so that I can move the hell out of that frat house. I'm chomping at the bit to get a car but I figure I'll just put that off until middle of the summer if I can make the motorcycle last that long. If I last that long on a motorcycle. Anyway, it will just feel good to feel a little more capable of being responsible for myself again. </p> Somehow or another I managed to have a very friendly day with my immediate supervisor. I don't know whether he's my boss or not but he's the person that's between I and the person that heads up that department out there and he strikes me as such a goon I just can't stand him. I didn't know it at first but I guess he is younger than I am which is a rather unusual situation for me but he's just the dumbest person I think I've ever met which is an exaggeration, but he is. (0:05:03.9) Today, he is also a very insecure person like he will run around, he'll walk you in, we do an hour's work in the morning and we just work our brains out then. We do a little bit of paperwork and then we wait about three hours for the people to come back in from the route work so I was writing a letter. A friend of mine, the guy that works with me was reading the newspaper. He's the kind of guy that if he comes in and sees you doing that, he won't say anything to you. He'll walk back and go tell the engineer. Then he'll come in and say don't read papers or don't do this or something like that which I don't mind so much as kind of an asinine way to go about it but I can see even people getting caught up in that kind of shit.</p> Right. You have to look busy even though it's sheer stupidity to try and do it but this guy doesn't have the guts to say it, something on his own, it's supposed to be his responsibility but for some reason, well I had a little toy in my pocket on the way to work (0:06:09.1) I didn't notice it until I got to work but have you ever seen these little things called clackers, the two balls on the end of a nylon cord. Swing them back and forth and they hit at the top and they hit at the bottom and bounce back and forth. Their a real bitch to learn how to use but I got some when I was in Wichita the last time and I noticed I had them in my pocket. So I was showing a friend of mine, the guy that I work with how to use them, another guy came in and he wanted to try it so he is good friends with all the wheels there so he went out and brought in everybody. About six people and they're all standing around wanting to learn how to use these crazy things. Well, this whatever he is, came back in about an hour and a half later and picked them up off my desk and started playing with them again and stayed there for I'll bet it was an hour and a half constantly clacking these things around until he finally got them working and then he asked me if I wanted to go out and go get a Coke with him. You know it's a cardinal sin to get caught reading the newspaper and he wants me to just trip off with him. So we went out and just killed about an hour and a half middle of the afternoon just partying around. I'm not sure what to think of it yet but I'm real happy about at least even though he still doesn't strike me as a too reasonable character I least I don't have to worry about him being on my back anymore. (0:07:39.9)</p> Yeah, amazingly that and he strikes me a lot like Ross Zuckerman used to, the guy's just dying to have someone be friendly with him because everybody is always putting shit on the poor guy. I feel sorry for him for that. It's no wonder he's always stumbling over his own mouth. He's real enough he just doesn't seem to know where he's at. It's just about the end of the quarter here isn't it? </p> I don't know what they call it. I've been gone too long.</p> I guess that's part of the reason that everybody around the frat house is on such a it's </p> People are really acting like assholes around here.</p> I don't know. I've gone through it before and I was well aware of what a lot of them you know I didn't see them for a week on in and when I did they had dark lines down to their chin but I realized what was going on then and you know they just studying and can't go out running around at night but for some reason or another it started like nigh on to a month ago people around there have just been getting more and more obnoxious. I should say uptight but that doesn't even seem to be it. </p> Well I don't know if it's the pressure of exams. I really doubt it. I got to thinking and until he moved out, it seems that the way things always got going was that a person that was a good friend of mine during the summer, he and I were there all summer long so we became good friends and other people were there during parts of the summer but we were the only ones there all summer long and we just got into a really gassy thing of having a good time all the time. I won't say all the time, I mean every weekend we were out finding something to do, we were in Wisconsin or out at the Mississippi playing around somewhere or another and that went on through the first quarter and then he moved and got his own apartment. The guy that took over his place is kind of withdrawn, he doesn't, you never really know what's going through his head and he and I got along okay for a while and for some reason or another he just started acting like a real bastard after a while. He wouldn't let anybody in his room. I had about a $400 record collection in there that he could use and I came up and listened to them on a stereo. So he started locking his room. I finally took my records out. It was the room, it isn't actually his room where the things are, it's (inaudible @ 0:11:08.0) who moved out but nobody's moved in there. He has the key so he locked it up and wouldn't let anybody in there. It was kind of a commons room. We all ended up there after dinner. You know we would all go up there and listen to records or something. It just kind of destroyed whatever center we had for all of us getting together and being friendly and I don't know what his point is but he's really been acting like a bastard. It has really broken things up. The only time I see anybody is at meal time and I talk to some of the other people. They noticed that there is just not the </p> Right. Although it wouldn't exactly have a expectant fraternity image the way we usually got together at least it was the so called brotherliness that was supposed to be there and now people just it's you have your own little cubicle and if somebody happens to run into your hall you say hi and go on (0:12:04.2) which hasn't bothered me much lately. I'm so anxious to get out of there I don't mind that much. I figure it should be about the first of June before I get enough money back together to go to Boise again. There's at least three people who will be visiting New York in the meantime and there's also the outside chance that Jessica might come up but that's pretty outside. Making sure this is still solid. On the way to work I was driving along with Josh and he's nigh on impossible to wake up so we'd taken off right down the block here and gotten to the corner of 65th and Sweeney Ave I guess it was. As we came away from the light, well no it's whatever it is where the light is just before you get to the thing right at the park, I don't know what the hell the names of them are, that he came rolling off the line, there was a car to the left of us, we had to make a left, I mentioned you can turn left from either lane</p> Okay</p> They're looking for me. </p> Oh, am I supposed to do something downstairs before I come up?</p> Oh, well I'm always late when I come up here. </p> Well that's happened once. I just wandered across the hall and hung out over there.</p> Oh yeah and I mentioned to him that you can turn left from either lane and I didn't really understand what he was saying but it was kind of like stop nagging. He goes I (inaudible @ 0:15:12.7) and it just kind of flashed on me I'm going to play a Tye on him and see what he does. I said all right, I'm sorry. I'll not tell you how to drive again and he went crazy. He just really blew his stack talking about how oversensitive he was and screaming, I had to keep from laughing and I couldn't really tell him why I had done what I did because I knew it wouldn't be believed but I really don't know what to think what the reaction was but it was interesting to see that violent reaction to it. </p> Oh no he, I don't know whether it's a good idea now that I've done it because he's now convinced more than ever that everything that has happened is all been my fault, it's all my over sensitiveness now. </p> Well if it wasn't if it wasn't so impossibly troublesome, yeah it would be. </p> Right. I just he's not really willing to admit unless I should accept all the blame. I'm sure, well I'm not sure, I'm sure if I would accept all the blame he'd let it go at that but to say that he's been oversensitive to him or to say that there's a problem here and I'd like to see what it is, either way, would be at least admitting the possibility that he had something to do with the problem and that would just piss him off all together again.</p> Or it isn't. (0:17:25.2) That and I'm wondering since I hope to move out of that frat house as soon as possible, how I'm going to manage to do it without taking Josh with me since I could not live with him. His personal habits are just terrible, he's just the dirtiest person I've ever known. I've seen that guy go for three days and he didn't wash his hands once, I know it. Like he'll eat dinner, his hands are just black with filth and garbage from his cat, from oh god it's repulsive. Go into his room and he's got a cat box and he'll open a can of food, give half of it to the cat, a day later after it's rotted and the whole room is stinking he'll give the other half to him. I just couldn't live that way but I don't know how I would manage to trip out and find my own place without telling him that I really think that he's wrong. Which isn't the point, maybe he's not wrong, it's just not the way I want to live. It's another case where I would be condemning him. (0:18:40.1)</p> Yeah. I don't know how it ever came about. I guess since I moved up here Josh and I haven't had that much to do with each other but when I was still in Boise and especially, well Josh and I and Martin, who is in Europe, were kind of a trio. Jessup and I were together from eighth grade on and Tye joined us about senior year of high school and we were pretty much an inseparable three but especially after Jessup left Josh and I were just the closest of friends. We've never had a problem like this before. Not that I've known it but of course I don't imagine we ever had to work, be around each other quite as closely as we did before either. Anytime we were out for a good time, we were together and other than that we weren't around each other so it wasn't that much of a problem. </p> Hmm</p> No, no, my eyes are kind of blurry. (0:21:19.2) Live dangerously when you use pewter mugs. </p> Didn't you hear about that?</p> The glaze in mugs to be a workable glaze on pewter ware has to have a lead in it. There was a kid in Philadelphia that was killed by lead poisoning from pewter ware mug not too long ago. His mother mixed his orange juice in it and it finally got to him. </p> How far is New York from Canada?</p> Well, let's see there's nothing between here, is there anything north of here besides Canada.</p> Kind of feel like I'm been trying to build something ever since I started at work. Like I've just now gotten to a position where I've gotten enough of the shit that was already there that appeared in a way that I didn't want that I could start building whatever it was, whatever it will be.</p> Well no, definitely not something you can grab hold of but it's like I feel like I have enough of the intention and the commitment and the ambition to start with whatever I'm doing now and continue without falling back into not doing anything or falling back into doing something I don't want to do or something like that. Plus having gone through it a couple of times in the little circle I feel like I'm aware enough of how things happen or what could happen, that I could avoid having it happen. God I'd hate to try and make sense out of that. </p> Never in my life have I ever been ambitious or committed enough about something to really accomplish anything of any major import. Never did anything in school. I just never done anything. I just kind of drifted along and it used to kind of worry me that other people seem to be ambitious about things, they'd do things and if I accomplished something it was almost without me knowing it. (0:44:15.2) </p> It's kind of the first time in my life like I couldn't say it was I am ambitious about except I want to fucking be in a better position where I'm not going to get stepped on as easy but I'm willing intent on it. Like I'm willing to commit the next six years to get through school if it takes it. I'm willing to do this, I'm willing to do that. Although I can't say how I'm going to do it. Yet, I feel confident that I will get it done. It used to be that I kind of pipe dreamed about that, that would be nice but I really hadn't any idea how I would do it. It seems much more of a feasible situation now. It seems like I can actually do it if I just go ahead and put myself to it. </p> Yeah, it's up to a certain point, well it's been steadily awakening on me you might say for years now but I noticed that looking back I was I don't know where I was until I was probably a senior in high school. I was tripped up completely in myself. I mean other kids, some other ones and those that I talk to were aware of things going on around, they had ideas about what was going on, I was just completely lost in myself. Like I got into high school and it just really blew me apart when I realized there was a whole world out there that not only affected me but I affected it. It was like I spent my whole time up until then just tripped into myself and from then on I just kind of been going around in a daze and being a little more aware really not knowing what's going on or how it fits together or what I can do about it. I was had my eyes open but I was still just caught in the flow of traffic and now I feel like I'm not only moving along with the traffic like in a time span but I can also go ahead and maneuver myself in it.</p> That's the exact image that I used to have. A leaf in a stream that would just float along and a wave would hit it it would get knocked in a certain direction, the wind would blow it the other way. Now I feel like I'm a little more capable of steering my own course. (0:47:32.4)</p> Recently, I don't know. It didn't come suddenly. Like I said it's come over the last few years. Like I felt myself in this kind of position several times in different ways but this is the say the first time I felt that I could do it financially, that I could do it that I feel like just capable of continuing everything like no doubt another twenty years from now if I manage my first million and I'm sitting off in a mountain home somewhere with another one down in Acapulco I'll think well now I'm ready. Right now I'm at another point where I'm considerably more capable than before. </p> Like how would I ever get there? </p> Yeah. </p> Well I don't even know if that's where I would be headed. I think Jessica and I seem to be at that kind of stage too. </p> That isn't yet but we're realizing that is just around the corner. When we kind of half assed committed ourselves to the possible two year wait, (inaudible @ 0:50:29.9) we were dead serious about it but I don't think we ever had any idea what we were getting into but now after suffering through what we have, we've kind of threw our actions and because of our actions, disconnecting us from being any other way we're kind of out of a social realm except for Jessica and I (inaudible @ 0:50:55.9) we are committed so that even if we didn't want to we'd have a helluva a time changing the situation before she would be eighteen anyway and not that we want to, it's just that we're committed not only by our own standards but by what's happened and by the way we feel now but I have a feeling that in another eight to ten months we'll kind of reap the harvest of waiting and going through all the bullshit that we have.</p> I plan to enjoy it. </p> Just as you said that my stomach growled so hard it put my eyes out of focus. </p>",0
1004600918.txt,"Hi. How are you? </p> Yes because I've been contacting people, and everyone I contact has a wait list so I'm frustrated. It's also a little complicated just because of our insurance and sudden change. I spoke to one woman yesterday and she said I don't take your insurance because that's what we have now so you can pay out-of-pocket. But then I don't even know what our insurance is going to be in August so it kind of complicates things a little bit. [00:01:06]</p> They only gave me 36?</p> That's not even a week for year. </p> Cover anything. [00:02:02]</p> Okay. (inaudible at 00:02:16) because some people say that they offer a sliding scale for people who are paying out-of-pocket. So I'll just say that we need to pay out-of-pocket until August. </p> In August. End of August. He's going to start his job the last week of August so he will then and then we should be all set. But yeah so I've been contacting people. This is actually kind of (inaudible at 00:02:49). I've been contacting people and I brought it up to Chris. I was a little nervous to bring it up to Chris because we talked about it forever ago like the fact that we wanted to go see somebody before we had a baby. And I wasn't sure how he was going to react, what he was going to say, and the thing that I remembered was that... So we had to go to Pre-Cana before we got married which is just like (inaudible at 00:03:26) pass our church. [00:03:28]</p> Like this seems to me... Like I talked about it last time like newlyweds shouldn't have these kinds of problems. They shouldn't have... And I guess I just need to get over that. And I just need to... Like I just feel like we shouldn't be having these huge fights. I always felt like that kind of thing came later because problems in your marriage came later. Like early in your marriage everyone's so doe eyed like googly-eyed over each other and like they can't keep their hands off each other. And I guess we still have that, but we still have huge fights too. And so—I don't know—I guess I struggle with that a little bit or think that it's so early in our marriage why do we... But I just need to get over it because we deal with these problems. It doesn't matter if we're a month into our marriage, two years into our marriage, these are our problems. This is what it is. I have to deal with them now. So I just need to get over it. [00:09:46]</p> I don't know. I guess it depends. Like I think as far as he sees it his OCD is manageable so I don't really know. I think maybe he did once so maybe. I don't know. I don't know. I think if it was something that it was clear that I really wanted but I feel the same way with him as I feel about every other person in my life like speaking for addicts I guess. I know Chris is not an addict but I feel like it's a similar thing like you shouldn't want to fix yourself just because I want you to fix yourself. [00:13:23]</p> But neither of those things the person can control. (Pause) </p> Yeah. </p> Right. And I guess I'm hoping that when we go together that's something that we could talk about; that he could talk about.</p> Yeah. Well and that's kind of what I said that too him but that's why I want us to go see somebody together is because I don't want to have that. And so (pause) I want him to talk about it and—I don't know—to maybe recognize on his own that that's something that he needs to work on. I don't know. [00:16:24]</p> I know that I would love to say I'm proud for myself like on my own (pause) because what I want is to be just like that. Running yesterday was purely motivated by other people. It was the best run I've ever had. I finished in 7.5 and I ran up three hills in between. It was a great run. I felt great about myself. But it was motivated out of Emma saying that... [00:28:22]</p> Yeah, it's really pathetic. (Pause) It feels embarrassing. [00:33:02]</p> She would never say it. She would never say it out loud. But yeah, she would definitely judge me. It's like a constant thing like oh Jodie (sp?) looks great during this pregnancy. (inaudible at 00:35:24) on her second baby right now and with her first baby and she gained a lot of weight, but it's a point. I was like oh did you see Jodie (sp?) at the race? Yeah, she looks great with this pregnancy. It's just like oh this is this thing. It seems to be (pause) </p> Uh huh.</p> Yeah. I guess so. (Pause) Yeah, I just need some... I don't know. I think that just comes out of an insecurity. I think anybody who is really competitive it's because they're not secure enough in what's happening with themselves. And so with my cousin being pregnant already that's because I have an insecurity about not or that's something that I want, and she has it, and I don't, and I'm jealous. [00:37:10]</p> Right. Exactly. Well my goal is that I want to be up here. I want to feel better than her I guess. But keeping it to myself I feel better inside. I guess I just try to suppress that need to (pause) say something to her or to other people. Because the only place it gets is getting the other person's feelings hurt. And I guess that's kind of what Emma did. She was kind of hurting my feelings. I felt like I was being insulted a little bit, and I kind of wanted to like—I don't know—like get a dig back I guess. [00:39:16]</p> Uh huh. Like a little kid with a toy. (Pause) I didn't feel that way about my cousin Jodie who's a year older than me and she's on her second baby now. She had her first baby before I was even engaged and she was engaged and that, and so it didn't feel like I was on that level yet so it didn't effect me. I was happy for her, and I didn't have these same feelings even though I'm closer to her than I am to this particular cousin. And even this baby that she's pregnant with now I didn't feel that way, and I think maybe it's because of her circumstances in life. I think her husband's a chef. They live in her mom's condo and they just... I guess I just don't feel competitive with her I guess is what it comes down to at the end if I'm being totally honest. [00:42:19]</p> Because I guess they don't have things that I'm envious of like I wouldn't want to be living in my mom's condo. I wouldn't want to be... She works in the mornings and he works in the evening, and they have this lifestyle that I am just not—that doesn't appeal to me and I don't want that. And so I guess it's just not a threat. I mean I say that in a way that it sounds like but I guess that's true. I guess it's just like oh that's good. That's good for you like your life doesn't look anything like I would want my life to look like so it just doesn't really bother me. [00:43:09]</p> Okay.</p> Uh-uh. </p> Okay, flex spending and PPO.</p> Okay. </p> That's great. Good to know. Thank you very much.</p> Oh thank you so much.</p> That's great.</p> Okay. See you then.</p> Bye. [00:47:19]</p>",3

[00:02:03]</p> Um, but — like, I knew I had the scholarship, but he wouldn't tell me what it was or where that money was coming from.

I don't know if that'll last, but, you know...</p> And I — [he did] (ph) [inaudible at 11:18]</p> Um, [pauses] it is hard, um, but...</p> Yeah. And then, yesterday, I decided to — to force the issue with Franco, Sascha, and also with Dan (ph), um, and said [chuckles], ""[Fuck this] (ph)."" So...</p> ...I wrote Sascha an e-mail in the morning, just saying, like, ""Hey, what's up? Uh, I — you know, I hope that you're OK."" [00:12:01]</p> ""I hope that you and I are OK.""</p> You know, ""I was disappointed that I didn't get to hang out with you last week, and I'm — was frustrated that you didn't reply to my e-mail."" You know?</p> And...</p> Yeah, I mean — and then, [chuckles] as I was coming into campus in the afternoon, I realized, like, ""It is raining today. It is going tomorrow. It is going to rain the next day. My umbrella is at Franco's. This is ridiculous."" And so I texted [chuckles] him and was just like, ""Can I have my umbrella back [chuckles]?""</p> Um, and then, with Dan (ph), I realized, actually, that the e-mail that I had meant to — thought I had sent, saying, ""Yes, let's talk,"" um, I never did send...</p> ...Or it didn't get sent, so we were kind of both waiting to hear from the other.</p> So I e-mailed him and was just like, ""Yeah, [slaps surface] I would like to talk."" Um...</p> [Clucks] With Franco and Sascha, it did not — I do not feel good about this situation, um, in that [shifts in seat] [pauses] Franco, um, texted me back, and he was like, you know, ""Yeah, give me a call. Like, come by when you're done."" Um, and so he came out to meet me, like out of the house, and, like, had the stuff.</p> Yeah, and it was a — it was a situation where he was, like — he's — both he and then Sascha later, you know, [slaps surface] were like, ""We're sorry. It has been a really busy week."" And, first, Sascha had horrible migraines, and now Franco has this horrible sinus infection, and Sascha and Franco — is like helping Franco be - like, basically deep clean the apartment to get rid of any possible allergens to make it better. So he was, like, ""Sascha is sorry she can't come down. She's, like, elbow-deep in bleach."" Um, [I'll pretend, sure] (ph), it is true. [I'll pretend, sure] (ph), it is not actually the reason that they're not talking to me, um, and that makes me incredibly angry. Um, it would not hurt me for either — I just feel like I tried to make it really, really easy for Sascha to level with me, and she didn't, um, and I don't have any patience for that. Um, [sighs] I have a whole lot of sympathy for Sascha, but it doesn't go that far. Um, I need people to be honest with me. Um, so I — I was talking with this — James about this last night, um, and he said, ""Well, what would you have wanted them to say?"" And, honestly, I would — I'd really prefer... [</p> Yeah, [chuckles] ""I'm sorry. There is stuff going on that makes it hard for us to see you right now, and I can't tell you what it is."" I would have been totally OK with that. Like, that would be fine. Um, [pauses] [sighs] and the — the thing that is also really hard is that I would — I would never have relied on Franco in the way that I have, I would never have felt like I could just call him up and say, ""Can I spend the night with you? I need somebody to — I need to be with somebody."" Like, I would not have put that on him if I had thought that it would hurt Sascha; [sounds emotional] I wouldn't have done it. Um, the reason I thought that was OK was because Franco said, ""Yeah, Sascha is OK with it, and if she's not OK with it, I don't care. You know, she's going to have to be OK with it."" And now I feel like I'm getting punished for that, and now I feel horrible about [becomes emotional, shakily] having... [00:16:04]</p> I [exhales, about to cry]...</p> ...About having relied on somebody. Um, I feel bad [shakily] about Franco — the way that Franco has [begins to cry] taken care of me. Um, [whimpers]...</p> ...I — you know, I feel like I'm hurting somebody by having — [begins to cry] — by needing this. [Whimpers] Um, it is just not — it is just not fair. [Exhales] [pauses]</p> And I — I didn't see it coming. Um, [pauses] you know, and now I really have [shifts in seat] done everything that I can do. [00:17:00]</p> So, [pauses five seconds] you know, I think Sascha is staying 'til Thursday, and then she and Franco are going to the Beach for a while. And he said, ""You know, when I get back, like, we'll have lunch."" So we'll have lunch, and I'll tell him these things, and [slaps surface] [whispers] we'll figure it out. Um, the thing is like I — I want Franco to choose Sascha over me; I just think that's a false choice. Like, there is...</p> Yeah, it really is not. Um, [exhales] and so I'm angry with Sascha for putting them in this position, and I'm angry with Franco for allowing himself to be put in this position. Um, but I'd also — I don't even know that that's necessarily what is going on. You know? I have — I don't have access to... [00:18:10]</p> ...The information, and so I can't — I can't figure it out. Um, you know, so, of course, I catastrophize. [Chuckles]</p> [Sighs]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, yeah, which doesn't stop me from feeling like I ought to have been able to keep it from happening.</p> Um, no matter how much I — I recognize that I am not caught. [Chuckles].</p> [Chuckles] I cannot keep these things from happening.</p> [Chuckles] Um, [pauses] you know, I don't [shakily, emotional] want Franco to be another person that I lose because he cares about me. Um, like, [emotionally] that's bullshit. I'm not willing for that to happen. Um, [shakily] [pauses] [begins to cry, sniffles]... [00:20:00]</p> I'm thinking of Dan, mostly. Um, but [sighs] [pauses for five seconds] I don't — I'm at a loss for more than one example otherwise, but I guess I feel like [sighs]...</p> Yes.</p> Um, yeah, you better not fall in love with me; that's all I'm saying. [Chuckles] Like...</p> [Chuckles]</p> I — I [shakily] was talking to Amanda, um, like, right after Dan told me that he was in love with me, and I was, like, ""This is ridiculous! I don't understand this."" [00:21:01]</p> ""I'm not the kind of person that people fall in love with."" And she was, like, ""Tanya, you've had three people fall in love with you in the last year. Like, you are that kind of person.""</p> [Chuckles] [Slaps surface] [Exasperated] [seems to be both chuckling and becoming emotional] I don't understand. That doesn't make sense to me.</p> [Chuckles] And — but I — I can't control that, [shakily] and I cannot — [begins to cry] I just lose people. Um, [cries] [sniffles] [recovers emotions] — but then I also feel like [slaps surface] I — you know, and there is also that I really, really don't want to be my mother. So [sniffles] I have more men friends than women friends, and part of that is, I think, not, you know, not, you know, being raised by a man and not being comfortable, at all, women for, you know, most of my childhood. And part of that is my field is heavily male-dominated.</p> You know, there's two other women in my program that are anywhere near me in age.</p> I guess three, but one of the other ones is — she's not taking courses this year and hasn't been on campus lately.</p> Um, and — yeah, so [sighs] uh, [pauses] — and — the way my mom works is, whenever there's a man in the room, she wants to [exhales] infatuate that person, and she will — is very, very charming, and she's very, very good at it.</p> And [pauses] — you know, so one of the — one of the grudges that I hold is that...</p> ...Our whole lives, she said, ""You are the most important people to me,"" but...</p> ...Anytime there was any other man in the room, we were less important than that person.</p> Um, always. And so I think, ""Is that me?"" I don't — like, I honestly — like I don't know. Um, like, I am a flirtatious person, but, more, it is just like I just like people, um, and I talk to people, and I trust people and...</p> ...[Chuckles] I - [becomes emotional] I like those things about myself, [begins to cry] but [cries]— like I really value those things about myself [sniffles] [cries] [whimpers].</p> Yeah, [pauses] yeah. [Sniffles] And I'm either lucky or possess their judgment in being married to James, um, who is the least jealous person I've ever met - like, really, the least jealous person I've ever met, um, in that, [sniffles] I talked with him about some of this last night, and he was just, like, you know, ""Tanya, I really want you to know that you can tell me when you fall in love with people, like, you can tell me when people fall in love with you. That doesn't threaten me.""</p> Um, which is shouldn't, so that's good.</p> Um, [exhales] you know, 'cause I mean, yeah, I'm always going to pick James.</p> Um, [pauses] but [pauses] he has to - [pauses] [whimpers] that's one thing that he could have to deal with, that I don't have to deal with. [00:25:01]</p> Um, but [pauses]...</p> [Sniffles]</p> Mm-hmm. [Suddenly sounds upbeat] Not too much.</p> Um, but I'm definitely — it is definitely a possibility that I'm always on guard against, um, with you and with other therapists.</p> Um, [pauses] you know, 'cause, like I said, like, I fall in love with everybody; that's not a big deal. [Chuckles]</p> [Sniffles] Like, I'm not worried about my ability to keep our relationship in appropriate levels and appropriate conduct (ph).</p> Um, and I — I do trust you in that, but also, I mean, [sniffles]... [00:26:05]</p> ...I kind of — I trust everybody.</p> It still scares me. [sniffles]</p> [Sighs] [slaps surface]</p> Nuh-uh.</p> No, it hasn't.</p> Thank goodness.</p> I wouldn't know what to do with that.</p> Um, you know, eh, Dan threw me for such a loop...</p> ...Um, you know, because in my relationships with the teachers, I've always taken as the same — you know, similar to relationships with therapists. It is like, this is the same relationship. [00:27:01]</p> I don't have to worry about this, in this relationship.</p> [Sighs] [pauses] Although, I have a long and glorious history of having crushes on teachers.</p> And, since Dan, [chuckles] that has not happened.</p> [Chuckles] [inhales laughing] So that's something that it has cured me of... [chuckles]</p> ...Or at least, you know, put it off for a year or two.</p> Um, and, you know, I'm at the point where they — there's enough inherent equality in the relationship that it is not — it can't be a safe place anymore, in that, between graduate student and professor...</p> ...There is loss of a distance. [00:28:00]</p> Um — [shifts in seat] um, you know, I — [pauses] yeah. [Silence for 11 seconds] But, you know, I feel bad even saying these things because it is still a little absurd to me that people would love me or could love me. Like, I [becomes emotional, shakily] — I don't understand it. [Chuckles]</p> Yeah. [00:28:56]</p> Yeah. Or I don't think ""too close"" is the right way to phrase it, though.</p> Um, close in...</p> ...Inappropriate ways.</p> Um, you know, because I don't — I don't think that it is possible for me to be too close to Franco.</p> Um, I do think it would be possible for me to be close in inappropriate ways to Franco. Um...</p> ...I did fall for Franco one summer. Um...</p> ...Yeah, that was the problem. [Chuckles]</p> Um, [chuckles] Franco never noticed but James noticed, and...</p> ...He and I were...</p> Well, I noticed. Um, and he and I were having a rough summer anyway, and...</p> ...I, um — and so we — they were — there was some [fight to that bet] (ph)...</p> ...And that was something we had to work through.</p> And, in part, we worked through it by, you know, me — you know, me saying, ""James, you can trust me not to do anything inappropriate,"" and him trusting me...</p> ...And, in part, it worked. We've worked through it, but I got over it.</p> Um — but, eh — I don't — I don't see that happening again.</p> And if it did happen again, I would tell James about it, and we'd work — work it out; like, it would be fine.</p> [Sighs] No.</p> That — [exhales] — that is...</p> ...I mean, that is what I think...</p> But, now and then, I feel like maybe I'm being unfair to Sascha. I don't know.</p> Um, and I — [pauses] I don't want to be unfair to her, [speaks softly] just because I'm really angry at her. [Chuckles]</p> Um, you know, in some ways, because I'm so angry at her, I'm — I'm trying really hard not to scapegoat her in this situation.</p> You know, to say, like, ""No, this is something that we're all doing."" And it is — it — you know, she couldn't do — you know, she couldn't be this way if Franco wasn't part of this relationship. At — like — [slaps surface] [sighs with exasperation] I don't know. I — [pauses] [exhales] I feel like I'm getting hurt because of things that are not healthy in their relationship. [00:32:00]</p> Um, and, on the one hand, it is kind of not my business if things are not healthy in their relationship. Um, if there's abuse going on, then, yeah, that comes with it.</p> Um, but I watch for that.</p> And I'm, you know — and I'm pretty clear about when it is my job to say something and when it is not.</p> Um, I mean, I'm clear in my head, but I'm not actually clear about it because [speaks more softly] I want to control everybody's lives. Um...[chuckles]</p> I lost my train of thought. I'm sorry. [Speaks softly, like preoccupied] Um, [pauses] — yeah, I think there was a narrative there, but it wasn't very important, and now it is gone.</p> ...Or it was a repetition of what I've already said.</p> [Chuckles] [00:32:59]</p> [Chuckles] [Inhales] I just really don't want to lose these people.</p> Um, you know, they're better than this.</p> [Shifts in seat] Um, [pauses] and I, myself, am so [becomes emotional] out of sync with the world that I don't — I wonder whether I'm the person who is causing all of this and not even — I don't even know it. You know, I don't [pauses] feel [sniffles] [exhales] — on the one hand, I feel — I — I — sometimes, I feel pretty confident in my actions and in the way in — that I'm doing the right thing, and sometimes I think [slaps surface], ""How can I even tell when I'm doing the right thing?"" Like, I can't even [begins to cry] [pauses] [exhales] — [00:34:03]</p> Well, all — all I did was, like, shooting an e-mail, saying, ""Hey, let's go see <i>The Avengers</i>."" Um...</p> Yeah, and then I wrote another one. Um, [pauses] but — I mean, part of the reason I'm angry at Sascha is that, through my entire, you know, period of depression for the last year and a half...</p> ...She's been really supportive, sent me a couple of really great notes. She sent me this, like, incredible care package. Um, and every single time she wrote me, she said, ""If you ever want to talk, call me; I'll be there,"" and, actually, this is the one time that I've reached out to her, and [dissmissively] nothin'. Um, [exhales in exasperation] so it is hard not — for me not to say, ""Well, I guess that doesn't really mean very much that you said that."" [00:36:25]</p> [Chuckles]</p> [Chuckles]</p> Well, it is different being, like, ""Hey, let's go see <i>The Avengers</i>!"" Um...</p> It is hard to — um...</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Um, yeah.</p> Yes, I did.</p> Yeah. Um, and — and she wrote back and said, ""Yeah, I'm really sorry. We've been busy and sick."" Um, [pauses] yeah.</p> Wouldn't...</p> [Clucks] It sounds like it, but, I mean, I don't know.</p> You know, maybe I'm thinking these horrible things about my friend, and there really is nothing more than that. Um...</p> [Becomes emotional] ...But?</p> Yeah, and...</p> And, in any normal week, I mean [sniffles] — considering, you know, on the Thursday before last, when - that was the last night that I was staying with Franco, he stayed up two hours past his bedtime because he was worried about me.</p> It means he was worried about my safety. Like, in any normal week, he would give me a call this week or last week.</p> Um, [sighs]...</p> Yeah. Yeah, and I know this, but I — I don't know it. You know, I know this, but I have to keep treading that same ground of, ""I am justified in being upset."" [00:38:53]</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah, that's exactly it. [Drums surface] [pauses] That's — it is kind of [exhales], you know, it is the boomerang that pretty much always happens before, you know, ""Maybe this is really [becomes emotional] my fault.""</p> [Chuckles]</p> [Laughs] ""Sorry.""</p> [Sniffles] Gimme (ph). [Chuckles]</p> [Chuckles]</p> Yeah, um...</p> ...It is just — it is easier for things to be my fault than to be somebody else's fault. Like, I can deal with that way better; not actually, [chuckles] but...</p> ...I'm much more comfortable [chuckles] dealing with that.</p> Um [chuckles]...</p> Yeah, yeah. Um, [pauses] yeah. [Exhales] I try really, really hard to let go of needing to control things. Um, but I'm really conscious that I do that...</p> ...And I work really hard not to. Um, [sniffles] you know, like not asking you what we're doing here. [Chuckles] And so [laughs more vigorously] [tries to recover from laughing] sometimes, I do weird things because of it. [Chuckles]</p> Um, [chuckles] but then, like, I don't — I don't have a good sense of what I should be able to control and what I shouldn't, so [slaps surface]...</p> Mm-hmm.</p> [Gets up from seat] Have a good day.</p>",3
1004564981.txt,"I'm sorry?</p> Not a whole lot. One of the things I've been thinking about that we've been talking about is how sometimes people tend to show themselves in my life as not being especially - the word good is not really the word for it but have the most (pause) actions intentions being the most honorable that I sometimes still give them the benefit of the doubt. And I've given a lot of thought as to why I feel that way about that. And I think the big thing is, is that I by nature have had that experience in my life more than a few times like as in people have decided I was doing something - that I had a lot of less than kind (pause) intentions when I've not. I've either been oblivious of I've been this or I've been that and they've assumed that things are... And so I try really hard to give people the benefit of the doubt much longer than I should. [00:01:27]</p> This hurt me so badly.</p> Usually especially if there's a zero energy lost from me doing so; not always though. But especially if there's a zero energy loss I will always treat them like they have good intentions. But if they don't - it depends - but a lot of times I'm willing to give people more chances than it's worth. It's just because the fact that it has bothered me so much in my life when I have been told what my intentions are and not only are they not true but they hadn't even occurred to me like kind of true. [00:02:15]</p> And that's something where it's always bothered me. In general, and this is something that very few people in my life have really gotten. I've only had like maybe a handful of people outside of my husband who understands that I'm actually an introverted person who fakes being extroverted. And so when they find out that I really need the downtime of not being around people, they're almost always shocked like completely shocked. I'm like yeah I really like to read and sometimes at the end of the day I just need to be not interactive because I get a lot of my energy from being by myself. And I mean I don't need to be by myself a lot, but I fake being extroverted. I mean I kind of half to. But it's almost always a shocker for people to find that out that I do find sometimes being around a lot of people to be overwhelming. And so they perceive sometimes - now mind you this is my in-laws. This is crack. [00:05:13]</p> Yeah.</p> There are certain situations that I am super, super comfortable in and I can throw myself into. And they're are ones that would most people would find to be very stressful. Like I had made jokes about the fact that I can socially engineer myself into jobs. I just put myself in the right situation. That to me is something that I learned at a very young age and, therefore, that doesn't bother me in the least to be in that kind of situation. Pardon me. I just need to make sure that isn't anything big. But it's normally the big things. It's the small things that I find to be very difficult like the high stakes game of having my in-laws come to visit and having to make small talk with them in the car. That's really hard for me. [00:07:22]</p> Yeah, yeah. I knew you weren't but... Okay, so he's colleagues with [inaudible]. I knew Harry Goldberg because I did a lot of...</p> Yeah. I did a lot of neural network research and, therefore, we had big relations and we were asking questions about... Yeah. So I knew him vaguely related to that. But my dad's like why don't you just go up to ask him and see if you can interview for a job with him.</p> With Shipman.</p> Yeah. He also does a lot of behavioral. He's technically an economist.</p> He did ""The Upside of Irrationality"" and ""Predictably Irrational"". However, I would really, really like to work out basically because of all the AI things I've done potentially making neural networks that behave irrationally would be something that would be fascinating and would help for modeling. But he sort of combines game theory with social theory with economics because he does a lot of the stuff on a micro economics scale. And my dad's like oh just go right up to him and talk to him. And I was like okay, sure. And it's funny because that is exactly the way I was bred to do that and raised to do that. And I probably will actually ask him but that kind of stuff I have no fear about at all. Vaguely famous author but who I have a relationship (inaudible at 00:09:37) with that I can say hey I would love to be able to try and see if we could do some validation on a logic based scale. That would be cool. We'll see what happens. [00:09:52]</p> Yeah which is weird. I am a person who thinks about just when it's on for quite a while and rethinks a lot. And so it takes me a while to sort of get that analysis of what was going on out of my system. I'm like this with many meetings. Whenever I have something that is very intense, whether it be like planning on a work related scale or something scientific, I always have this delayed action. If I see a movie that is especially cerebral or something it takes me a while to get past that. Not to get past but to sort of be done analyzing it and get back to who I am. [00:12:28]</p> It is that. It's also the fact that I am making a huge effort and not to make things happier or to automatically switch things. I almost always look for the bright side of things. I try making a very big effort in terms of not making - trying to read what you want and get that exactly to you. I work in an industry where that's what I have to do for a living is figure out what they want and make them happy. [00:13:24]</p> Yeah. So (pause) I'm just naturally a positive person and, therefore, to the point of sometimes squelching the negative.</p> It's hard to have this much candor in my life because it's not who I am.</p> I am one of those people that unfortunately sometimes focusing on the negative does not get it out of my system. Like there's a lot of times where people say oh well have you talked about this with this somebody? Not necessarily with a therapist but just like talk to a friend. Sometimes that actually gets me into this loop of self - like I come out of it feeling worse than I - You know what I mean? I can wallow if I let myself and, therefore, the mechanism of not letting myself do it is like that. The same reason why and I tell this to people well people always ask me you don't own a TV? Well part of the reason why I don't is because I can't afford a new one. But for a long time I didn't watch television. Why? Because I would sit down and I would not be able to get back up from it. I'd get stuck in the loop of whatever it is. [00:15:00]</p> Yeah. At the very, very end yes. And so that sort of made me into the he can do no right. He shouldn't be allowed to walk around in society. He cannot be trusted around his children. The only thing in his life he ever hit that was ever well known was at the end and that was with one person, but I decided just like that. It's like sometimes when I let myself get to that point where I'm just like I feel like I should warn people before they date him that sometimes he hits people. [00:17:07]</p> Yeah. Not just the control of the negative. I can control how I view it in general because I can decide what angle I'm going to see this from the positive if that makes sense. [00:20:15]</p> Yeah.</p> Yes. And one of the things that was a massive culture shock to me and I still get like this with some particular cultures - On my in-law side of things as you get further out from his nuclear family you get to the Italian side of the family and this is that kind of speak of you're dead to me and oh my God I'm going to go lay down and die kind of behavior that can drive me up the wall. Sometimes it's amusing because they'll say things like I am literally dying over here and I go if that were... Do you understand? Have you processed this? I know that English is your second language; that kind of thing. [00:25:44]</p> And that's just very hard for me. And I'm saying - I'm generalizing on this. I'm not saying everybody is like that. But coming in as an outside doing that it was pretty hard for me. That's just it's hard. But yeah, so...</p> Yeah. I try to keep it positive in me like well I was going to go see Don Giovanni but instead I'm going to go spend some time around the drama of this. Like I try to make it at least amusingly positive. It's the only way I can do it. Otherwise it's really not that charming but if I claim it's charming it makes it easier to deal with. Just like I have these generalizations that I speak of because it's hard really. [00:29:17]</p> Like if you were 100 feet away and you neglected a shadow of my husband. And it makes me so angry that there is nothing that can make me want her approval and (inaudible at 00:34:22). Which is bad. I don't think I'll go out of my way to piss her off that much. But it's coming to light that - I mean - his lack of memory was a defense mechanism not just like a oh that's a weird quirk that he doesn't remember anything before the age of high school. [00:34:46]</p> Yes. Very passive. He doesn't have an active role plus on top of it he doesn't always remember things. The only people that ever really encouraged me to come in with him was the pulmonary doctor when it was sleeping because they almost always want the spouse because the person who's having sleep problems tends to not be - like notice if they're doing these things, but most of the time they don't remember that kind of stuff. So that's pretty much what's been in my mind lately. (Pause) I can't much. [00:37:31]</p> I swear more in these sessions than I do the entire week. I'm not a swearing person. But in general though it's very, very hard to do this, and it's (pause) - because I'm trying very hard to spend the time reading you and giving you what you want, and I spend almost my entire life doing that.</p> I try not to think about it. Does that make sense?</p> I actively try not to even let that... A couple of times you've asked oh am I boring you and I'm like I haven't thought that far ahead. I'm trying really hard to limit my thoughts on that kind of stuff so that I don't influence my behavior if that makes sense. Yet I have to otherwise I will start subconsciously giving people what they want. And it's a pain in the ass but it's true. [00:39:21]</p> I appreciate that because, like I said, I'm trying very hard not to think about that. So it's weird because if I start opening that door... I'm the kind of person, by the way, who has gone to massage therapy and has been stressed out because of the fact that I'm not relaxing enough. And I have to cut off thinking about or doing certain things in certain situations and compartmentalize it or otherwise the activity becomes worthless. So yeah... And it's hard but for certain situations I sort of have to cut off my over analyzation (sp?) of everything. [00:40:32]</p> Yep. My mind's always going, always looking to pick up some sort of... I do a lot of small consulting, or some sort of freelance thing, or trying to do something. I am working - like my mind is working all the freaking time. It is exhausting. Sometimes it's kind of awesome because I'll do something like I'll be getting a drink, and I'll notice the capillary action in the straw which is kind of cool, but at the same time (pause) certain things ruin it. [00:42:32]</p> Okay. Sounds good.</p> Tuesday. [00:43:52]</p>",1

We went to check out on (chuckling) some places, you know which was kind of nice, because I did have it on my mind you know, so I was, you know as far as making out with her (chuckling). So I thought, I was really kind of surprised that she had said it. And we did you know, well after we had checked out a few places, we you know parked and made out and I liked it you know, again. You know it was really, it was nice and everything else. But one thing (chuckling) [more she's made] (ph), that while I was making out with her and I thought to myself, you know well should I have an erection, should I really be aroused you know? And then, then I thought, well if you're going to think about it, it's you know you aren't going to get anywhere (chuckling). So it worried me (chuckling). [0:02:52.4]</p> That, that I you know like I, you know like I, you know a couple of times you know I felt an erection coming on but then I thought about it, the minute I thought about it (snapping fingers) that was it you know, it just you know just [overlapping voices]</p> Yeah, I know, why!</p> Because — yeah, right. The reason, you know like I was [overlapping voices]</p> ...thinking about it [overlapping voices]</p> The reason I was thinking about it, you know the reason I was thinking about it, so I thought you know well if I (chuckling) don't get excited, if I don't have an erection, maybe I don't like girls or something you know.</p> That's what you know popped into my mind.</p> Yeah, right.</p> Yeah.</p> I know and I know this.</p> Yeah, it is (chuckling)!</p> M-hmm.</p> Uh-huh, yeah, I know that. You know and then, and I kept on trying to say, you know forget it, just forget it you know. And, and you know like two or three times you know all of the sudden I started thinking about it and it just seemed it kind of blew the whole (chuckling) thing because I was just worrying about it. And then I thought, oh, Christ you know. So it was really, it was that's the only thing that was bad about it, well it was me because I was worrying about it you know. [0:04:03.4]</p> Yeah, right (chuckling).</p> Yeah, right (chuckling), right! But that's, you know it was the only thing that was rotten about the whole thing was me worrying about it. So and I, you know I, and I'd you know I just try and you know, all right don't think about it (chuckling), don't think about it you know. And them me saying ""don't think about it"", I was thinking about it. I just couldn't just you know forget it and that was it. So that was the only bad thing about the whole thing (chuckling), but.</p> Yeah, right, right. And I thought I was doing so well (chuckling).</p> Yeah, right.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> Right, and I keep on telling (chuckling) myself this you know that it doesn't do any good.</p> You know just don't (chuckling). Yeah, like you know I really realize that, I really (chuckling) realize that. I've always been more or less a worrier (chuckling).</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, worried about things, yeah, worried about things. But that really kind of you know just, it was disappointing (chuckling) to me.</p> That I was worrying, you know that I was so you know upset about it. Well not upset, but you know at least concerned about the whole thing you know.</p> Yeah, and well not [overlapping voices]</p> No, no, it wasn't, you know it wasn't all that way, but when it, you know when I, I started thinking about it that's when I you know kind of like turned off. But I guess, like you said, it's being answered (ph), you know it's not going to come instantaneously.</p> ...and you are going to have worries, you are going to have times that you're going to worry about it.</p> Yeah, that's true.</p> That's true.</p> Yeah.</p> M-hmm, that I should you know.</p> Yeah, right, yeah.</p> Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.</p> Yeah, and then I'd think (chuckling) about it and then I'd start worrying you know.</p> I would think about, wow, you know. What would I think? Oh, I am having you know, oh, I am having an erection. Then you know the minute I'd think about it you know then it would you know completely forget it, you know.</p> Yeah, right you know that's it.</p> Yeah, right, yeah, that's it.</p> Yeah, right.</p> M-hmm, that's right, uh-huh.</p> Yeah, and then (chuckling) [overlapping voices]</p> And it disappears, yeah.</p> Right, and that's true, right. Yeah, that kind of takes preference over everything else [overlapping voices]</p> ...when it, you know when it shouldn't. Well you know [overlapping voices]</p> Yeah, right, right.</p> M-hmm.</p> Yeah, right.</p> Yeah, I understand that (chuckling). It's just kind of (chuckling) as a matter of fact you know just relax. And so and then I thought to myself you know, if you just relax and don't think about it you know, just relax you know (chuckling). And you know and then you know after a while and then, of course, I thought about it again (chuckling), but. Oh, and she, I said to Tanya, I said, ""Oh, did — have I changed?"" She says, ""Yes."" And then I said, ""Oh yeah?"" I says, ""Oh, you're not just saying that?"" She says, ""No, you know really.""</p> You know and I just, and I says, ""Oh, you're not just saying, you know just because we, you know we parked a couple a couple of times?"" She says, ""No."" You know just the whole outlook about [inaudible] I said, ""Well thanks (chuckling)."" You know she's just, it's kind of unbelievable. [0:09:00.6]</p> Yeah, right.</p> I'd come right out and say it, right.</p> Yeah, I did, I really did you know. And she just you know [overlapping voices]</p> Yeah!</p> Right. And she was just you know, oh, she was just, (chuckling) she couldn't say anything, so it was really terrific, (chuckling) it was really terrific. But (chuckling) I don't know.</p> M-hmm.</p> Right.</p> Right, right, yeah.</p> Uh-huh, really. And I think she was kind of surprised of the fact that you know that we, that I parked you know, that it was I who took the initiative (chuckling).</p> Yeah, right, it wasn't like the last time you know. It was just like you know I was the one who came over you know and said I wanted to go out. And then I was the one who parked you know and said you know ""okay"", and she says, ""Oh wow, we're going to park?"" And I said, ""Yeah, you know."" So she, you know she was really surprised there, too. She was really you know (chuckling), it kind of blew her mind (chuckling). But you know I did enjoy it, except for that one lousy factor (chuckling).</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm, m-hmm. And then the minute, you know and then I, then I started to think about you know, oh, what if, you know then the ultimate thing that if I you know did go to bed with her and I wasn't (chuckling) able to get an erection I'd, you know that would be it right then and there, and oh, it was (chuckling) you know.</p> Well I mean you know then I, you know I couldn't possibly have intercourse (chuckling) with her.</p> Yeah, that's — but I would feel, you know I wouldn't, no, I would feel kind of like [overlapping voices]</p> ...hat was the ultimate thing, yeah.</p> Yeah I know.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm.</p> Yeah, I can understand.</p> Yeah, uh-huh.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm.</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Yeah, I can see what you're saying. Yeah, right, if you're going to worry about it, you know this being the ultimate test, nothing is going to happen.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm, yeah.</p> That would be an awful experience though, it really would be.</p> Really.</p> Yeah.</p> Uh-huh, yeah.</p> M-hmm.</p> Yeah.</p> I see.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah (chuckling).</p> M-hmm, m-hmm, I imagine really (chuckling). Oh God, I hope I'm not nervous (chuckling), but I [overlapping voices]</p> ...probably will be. Knowing me I probably will be.</p> Yeah, if I'm — and I'd be worried about the whole thing and then [overlapping voices]</p> Yeah.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm.</p> In order to not.</p> M-hmm.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm.</p> M-hmm.</p> Yeah.</p> I see, yes. Well (chuckling), like I said, I hope that doesn't happen to me. But if it does I hope I do have the right outlook on the whole thing. [0:14:06.8]</p> Really (chuckling), really.</p> Uh-huh.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm.</p> M-hmm, I imagine it would (chuckling).</p> Yeah, that's true.</p> M-hmm, yeah.</p> Yeah, I know.</p> That's true, that's true, yes, yes (chuckling), really be awful (chuckling), back where I started from, yeah (chuckling), (yawning) I know. [Silence from 0:15:06.5 to 0:15:23.3] It's one of those funny things (chuckling), it's, uh, we're just teaching it in school and all the kids, they're generally interested, you know really interested (chuckling) [overlapping voices]</p> ...you know about the whole thing you know. And I take it you know they don't, there isn't any, you know they just accept it for what it is. And I think that, wow, this is really, you know there are a few who are very immature about the whole thing, you know they'll snicker and laugh and stuff like that. But most of them you know ask very intelligent questions you know about things and not be afraid to say anything about it you know (chuckling), which is really kind of nice (chuckling).</p> And it's, so even you know it's nice to approve (ph) you know if, if you know, to answer them, too, you know and just you know [overlapping voices]</p> ...just you know tell them, all right this is the word and this is what happens and stuff like that. But you know they're really you know very interested in it (chuckling). They, you know they do leave a lot, and they even, they do leave a lot out, now that I think about it. Between, um, you know they tell it, all right that the sperm you know meets the egg and all this stuff, but they don't tell, they don't say anything about going about it.</p> How it happens. You know they just kind of like [overlapping voices]</p> Scientific, yeah, right, yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Right, right. And like nothing is, is then you know, and I think they're really interested in how it happens. And okay,</p> No. Now up in the, the other grade they did you know. They said you know one kid came up and he says, ""Well you know well what happens (chuckling)? You know like how does the sperm get there"" [overlapping voices]</p> ""...you know?"" Well you what's the story you know? And the teacher said, ""Well you know of course, intercourse takes place."" And she just you know explained this you now.</p> But they, you know they leave it all out, you know there's nothing I mean as far as you know telling them.</p> Yeah, right, about sex, yeah, right. It's you now like they call it family living or (chuckling) something you know, but there isn't anything about you know the sex aspect of it.</p> Yeah, right, what the family does (chuckling), which is kind of bad, I thought. You know or at least I thought it was. You know they've, [overlapping voices]</p> ...sure they can see all the technical things about it and seeing everything you know and then they'll watch the picture of the, you know the sperm you know wiggling up to meet the egg (chuckling) and all this stuff, but they have no idea about the physical side of it in a sense (chuckling). But I guess it's something you just (chuckling) learn for yourself (chuckling).</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, right, really.</p> Yeah.</p> Publicly, really (chuckling). Really that's the truth, that's the truth. I know, maybe some day (chuckling) they'll have a movie (chuckling).</p> Right, yeah, let me see it myself (chuckling). Of course now days they practically do, but (chuckling). How many times have I been here? I'm just trying to figure that.</p> The eighth time, is that all? Oh, wow (chuckling).</p> I don't know, I just thought you know, well you now the eighth time. You know I thought it was like you know the, it seemed like I was really halfway you know through (chuckling).</p> Yeah, right, yeah, you know.</p> Yeah, that's it. You know I just you know feel different and everything else you know.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm.</p> Yes.</p> Uh-huh, I understand that (chuckling).</p> So I mean you know the, the greatest thing is just realizing you know what you are and well you know it's up to you.</p> I mean you're the only one who's going to change you, you know.</p> Yeah, right, you know and doing the same thing.</p> Yeah, right. You know it's just you're the only one who's going to change it you know. But it's also, it's kind of a, it's kind of like going through this change, it's kind of like coming here is more or less like a reinforcement you know and it [overlapping voices]</p> Yeah, right, yeah. And you know you just, you know and you could keep on going you know and you're not going to fall back into you're old patterns or [overlapping voices]</p> ...you're old ways just by coming here, which is even, you know that's kind of nice, too.</p> Right, right (chuckling). Certainly it helps me to keep on going and keep on changing. And you're not going to sit at that desk and say, ""Well so what?""</p> Which is nice for me because I'm the type of a person that needs a [overlapping voices]</p> ...push. Right (chuckling), that needs a push.</p> Yeah, right, really (chuckling). [Overlapping voices]</p> I am.</p> M-hmm, I am.</p> I am (chuckling). And am happy that I'm, and happy that I am you know.</p> Yeah, right, and do something you know, and doing something about it, instead of sitting back and doing nothing about it, which is really the nice thing about it (chuckling). That's certainly how a lot of people do, they become so paranoid you know, because they don't do anything about it you know and nothing is done about it you know. I mean as far as them doing something about it, maybe they need a push, too (chuckling).</p> Which is sad but (chuckling) there's always shock treatments (chuckling). I don't know what else to say (chuckling).</p> Yeah (chuckling). I really am (chuckling), like I don't know what else to say (chuckling).</p> Yeah, right. Yeah, I said it and so (chuckling).</p> Right, right, you know, that's about it (chuckling). [Silence from 0:22:46.8 to 0:23:34.6] It's like this morning, oh, I'd forgotten to bring Tanya the magazines, so she had to drop by school and pick them up you know on her way to work. So (chuckling) we were out in the front, you know and we were goofing around, and one of the other teachers (chuckling) had seen us you know and she was, ""Oh, who was that out in front with you?"" And I says, ""Oh, that was my Cancer."" I mean she was talking about different signs. They were talking about different signs the other day and they said, oh, is it Cancer and Scorpio were having heavy lovers or something (chuckling) like this you know. And I says, ""Oh, that was Cancer."" She's, ""Oh, yeah (chuckling)?"" And I said, ""Right, Tanya (chuckling)."" She's, ""Uh-huh."" She was carrying on a public display you know (chuckling). [0:24:18.8]</p> Right, right (chuckling). And I said, ""Right (chuckling).""</p> Yeah, right, really (chuckling). Oh, and Tanya said, you know, yeah, yesterday she was talking about, she said, um, that she was going to Spain this summer (chuckling), which kind of you know just, and you know like she's taking a course in Spanish cuisine and guitar (chuckling) or something like this. That it just came up you know, like a friend of her mother's that is planning to go, and you know like she has to have her, she had to have her money in today you know. [0:25:03.5]</p> And she just got the thing yesterday, so like an (snapping fingers) instantaneous decision you know. This week she said, well you know it costs something like, I've forgotten, oh, $650.00 from New York to Spain. And you've got, you know you have your room and board and your meals and, and you had you're, um, also you're tuition paid for and all that stuff you know. And then you have three weeks afterwards you know to travel and tour.</p> Oh, like from May 25, I think, to September 16, you know it's a long time.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, you know like the whole summer practically, you know would be shot.</p> Yeah.</p> You know I couldn't quite say you know ""don't go"".</p> Yeah. And like I, I knew I should've said something you know.</p> But I said you know, ""You know I just can't go, you know."" And I said you know and I was, you know I told her, I said, ""You know I've got rent to pay and all this stuff (chuckling), and I just don't have enough money."" So, um, you know, she goes, well she was going to go. And then but she was kind of hesitant and saying, ""Well you know I am signing up late and they've only got room for 300. I'll probably get my money back or something like this."" But you know I don't know if she, she did. She probably did send it in. I don't know. I'll have to call her and find out if she sent it in.</p> Yeah, right.</p> Yeah, it did you know.</p> That's true.</p> Yeah, that's true.</p> Yeah, that's true, yeah.</p> Yeah, I do you know. But I though you know (chuckling), I thought to myself, well who am I to ask her not to go you know. It's, I mean hell if I had the money, enough money to go to Spain I'd go, too, you know but, so I just didn't like it (chuckling), just couldn't get myself around to say it (chuckling).</p> I think it's kind of lousy but, to find out she mailed her money in (chuckling). That is a hell of a long time you know.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. There's an idea (chuckling). Don't tell her not to go, but tell her I do, I would miss her (chuckling). It sounded like a nice trip though (chuckling). And it's like reasonable for what you get out of it. I think you get six hours to [inaudible]. I don't know if it was six hours, six [inaudible]</p> Yeah.</p> Guitar.</p> Yeah. And she says, ""Or you could take"" she said, uh, I said, ""Well I'm not going to take cooking."" And Sheila (chuckling) says, ""You can take Spanish you know."" And she goes, well she was going to take Spanish, but she didn't, she decided she didn't want to study you know while she was over there (chuckling).</p> Yeah, right, anything as far as books were concerned, so she didn't want it. And I says, ""Yeah, I could see myself you know sitting around in Spain, you know and my writing some vocabulary or something (chuckling).""</p> No (chuckling), neither do I. And it's a 4-week course you know and I thought, oh wow, it could be a little bit too intensive besides that (chuckling) for that type of a course, but it did sound nice (chuckling). [0:29:05.4]</p> Yeah, well that's what she said. You know she says, you know it wouldn't be any of a big hassle for her and she'd enjoy doing that. You know it wouldn't be like studying or work or anything like that. It would be more of a pleasure than anything else. And I said, ""Yeah, it would be nice."" Said you know like you could've stayed in a home or you could've stayed in a dorm, which is really kind of interesting, too. They said it's at this University of San Diego, and he was sponsoring the whole thing. But (chuckling) and just she says ""well I'll make a hasty decision"", and she did (yawning and chuckling). Well usually when I make them I'm wrong anyway (chuckling), so.</p> Yeah, I was you know, it was kind of like a down feeling you know (chuckling), a down feeling (chuckling). I meant to ask her this morning if she was on her way to the post office. She bought a kit, sent, she had to send it like you know airmail and all that stuff actually.</p> Yeah, that's true.</p> M-hmm.</p> Yeah, that's true, why not (chuckling), even if she did send it in.</p> I don't know why. I don't know why you know. Maybe because I'm you know really not quite sure of myself, that you know like I should just you know say to her, ""you know stay with me"". And you know when she has this opportunity to you know do this fantastic thing. And just you know, well I thought you know I, I, I guess maybe why, I don't know. [0:31:01.2]</p> Oh yeah, it was, it was really.</p> Yeah, right, it was. It was really a surprise because you know like, well her, her mom had talked about it before you know, but I didn't, you know I thought well you know she's, you know they talked about it, so what you know. But then you know she said she had the booklet in her hand, she was filling out the old forms (chuckling), and I said, ""Oh (chuckling)."" And I was kind of happy she asked me to go along at any rate.</p> Yeah (chuckling).</p> Yeah, she, uh, she did. You know she didn't, she did want me to come along you know, and I was kind of happy that she asked me along. And I say, of course, I could've taken out a loan myself, yet I don't want to get into that nonsense (chuckling), so. [0:32:00.8]</p> I said, ""I ought to go back to California with them, because with them it would be cheaper (chuckling).</p> Because if we get this place on the beach then there's, you know instead of just my cousins and I it would be, they would also be you know kicking in for the rent (chuckling). So you know I was planning on going to California you know and, of course, I never invited her to go along you know. I thought about that (chuckling) later you know.</p> I could've said, ""Well why don't you come along with us you know (chuckling)?""</p> And she had been talking about driving cross country but that's about it. I mean you know I couldn't do that with anybody because I don't enjoy driving that much (chuckling), but.</p> This is just weird, how it changes (chuckling).</p> How it changed. That you know like before I was thinking of you know, if I wanted to go somewhere I'd rather be alone you know and go. But now it's different (chuckling).</p> Yeah, right, now it's different. It's really weird how I've changed.</p> Yeah, that's right (chuckling).</p> That's right, really.</p> M-hmm, m-hmm, yeah, that's true, that's true.</p> Yeah.</p> That's true (chuckling), that is true.</p> Yeah, right (chuckling), right. I was thinking about it and it would really be nice if I could go to Spain, you know really (chuckling). [0:34:04.6]</p> No. But you know like then you have to, if you travel afterwards you know. And she was thinking of that, but you know going further eastward in Europe or just you know going down to northern Africa, [inaudible at 0:34:20.4]</p> Oh, yeah, right, but this is all the, this is this package you know, [overlapping voices]</p> ...where you go to school and everything you know. And not being you know involved (ph) in it and I'd have to have three months rent saved up and you know.</p> No, not now (chuckling), not now. No one is subletting these days, at least in that area (chuckling).</p> So. At any rate, I will have to tell her I'll miss her though (chuckling). I don't know if that would do the trick but there's no harm in saying it (chuckling), at least she'd know I care (chuckling). [0:35:06.0]</p> Really (chuckling).</p> Together, right (chuckling).</p> Yeah, right, really.</p> Yeah, that's really it you know. I (chuckling) told her, like I said last night, I said, ""You know, well Saturday night"" I said ""I thought I was really rotten"" you know, and I said, you know ""because I really wanted to be with you Saturday night alone."" And she said, ""Yeah, right (chuckling).""</p> She says, ""Well now you know how I felt."" And I said, ""Yes (chuckling).""</p> Really. But she did mention that I'm, she says, ""And you're getting so verbal."" And I said, ""Right (chuckling).""</p> Yeah, right, I do.</p> Yeah, which is really kind of nice.</p> Yeah (chuckling). [Silence from 0:36:01.2 to 0:37:31.5] I was thinking that Tanya had mentioned this girl in her glass, one of her classes, you know and they were picking on this girl [simply because she wears glasses] (ph). And then probably, I remember myself I was always, I was picked on in high school, I remembered that. It was like I went to CVS, it's a vocational school on the south side of New York.</p> Yeah. It's always been kind of renowned as being as being one of the worst schools, and it was, and you know especially [overlapping voices]</p> A tough school, yeah, really.</p> Where I, I didn't have no business being there in the first place (chuckling). And I, but the reason I had gone there was, I remember it well. You know like I had taken the test, and you know you have to take a test to get into the private parochial schools. So I had to go to summer school, I took the test and I had to go to summer school for math and something else, I can't remember now. And anyway, um, actually you know I was just getting out of [inaudible at 0:38:27.3] Christ I don't want to go to summer school, you know (chuckling) I had school up to here. And so you know my father says ""Well why don't you go over here to CVS and you can learn a good trade and you won't, you know you won't have to go to school after high school"" and all this stuff, which was really a mistake because I had no (chuckling) business being there you know.</p> You know like a, it wasn't like a community school, you know like everybody came from everywhere else you know. And think, of course, being very small again, and I remember being picked on you know and stuff like that.</p> And I thought to myself and I said, you know well, and Tanya had said you know, well she took this girl down to the counselor. And I thought to myself, God if I was in high school, if I only, if I only would've gone to that counselor you know and really had seen you know. I think I had saw a counselor maybe once or twice in [inaudible at 0:39:29.6] year, and I think that was, I think maybe for college registration and then maybe one time for a permit to get a job or something like that you know whenever [overlapping voices]</p> M-hmm, yeah, right. You know and if I only had enough guts to get up [overlapping voices]</p> ...and say ""you know well this guy is picking on me"" you know.</p> Of course you know that was [inaudible at 0:39:54.3] you know ""I'll beat the shit out of you if you say anything"" [overlapping voices]</p> ...you know and stuff like that.</p> Yeah, right.</p> Yeah, right, yeah. And you know I thought to myself, wow, that was dumb. That was, uh, while, that was like, I think it was my sophomore or junior year. But then in the senior year kind of like everyone more or less changed I remember. You know everyone was getting out and everyone was, everyone was really trying to do their best at that point you know.</p> Yeah, right.</p> Yeah, right (chuckling). Everyone was you know really, really doing their best at that point. Seniors are really different, you know they are really, you know you really become so much more mature you know. And I remember you know and then I was getting you know much better grades and this one teacher kind of like you know took me under his wing and said ""you know go to college"" and all this stuff, you know so things really rather, it was really nice in the senior year. And there was really even a couple of guys who really you know I had got to be real friends with all during our senior year. But the other three were nonsense, just (chuckling) complete, utter nonsense, which is really sad, really sad. [0:41:10.0]</p> Yeah it was, it really was, it was a very difficult time. You know like I was, and then you know like all my brothers and sisters I mean they were all in the parochial school and all this stuff. And, um, it was like you know, oh, they were you know like they were out of school more than I was you know and I missed going to school (chuckling) and then you know lying in home in bed, I don't have [to give substantive thought] (ph) (chuckling). But the senior year you know you just kind of took it and just you know really did your best, which was kind of nice, at any rate after one year out of three (chuckling), I thought it wasn't too bad, it wasn't too bad.</p> Yeah, he would be in the midst of it. And he would be the one that would really become involved in it you know, and maybe it was ivy (ph). And it was probably the, the only reason I didn't was fear, you know become involved in it, [overlapping voices]</p> ...you know the fear of it you know.</p> [Christ's name, there'd just be] (ph), there'd be blood up and down the hallway (chuckling) and everything else, it was really quite a school, really quite a school. But the thing that after I you know was thinking about it, I thought you know, if you really did something within four years you could've really made it, make it worthwhile. You know because they, they did have an, offer you a lot, but it was up to you, you know.</p> Either you did it or you know no one was going to.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, yes, really.</p> That's the truth. Learning, you know like they did have, the teachers you know most of them were half decent and they had you know a lot of equipment and stuff to work with.</p> Yeah, you could've really learned something, but (chuckling) it just wasn't conducive (chuckling) to learning (chuckling). It was really kind of a joke.</p> Yeah, right, yeah. It's practically all black now.</p> Yeah. And I, and that's the time (ph), as far as the public school in the neighborhood that and you know is all black you know, and then you know you couldn't go to an all black school. I mean not that, you know I probably wouldn't have lasted a day anyway (chuckling).</p> So, which is the reason why. And just kids are cruel, they are really cruel, you know just [overlapping voices]</p> ...really cruel. Take today, this one girl, you know there's a couple of kids in this, in this school who are practically white. You know they, they really you know they're, you know you couldn't even tell, they could pass for being white. And you know the other kids go up to them you know ""are you, you know are you a honky"" and you know ""you blue-eyed honky"" and stuff [overlapping voices] [0:44:09.2]</p> ...like that you know and it's really so cruel. You know it's just really a shame you know.</p> Yeah, right. And I was thinking, you know I thought to myself you know after you know it would really, if effected, it effected me, you know how is this going to effect the rest of these kids?</p> Just because they're different you know, and they just you know. In fact, this one girl, you know she came up to Viv, she says ""I can't even tell you what they called me"", you know she had to write it down, they called me a white honky you know and just it's really sad, really sad. In fact, I wondered and you know I sense that you know like that so something was, well I heard someone expounding on children you know and how beautiful children are and all this stuff (chuckling). And I thought, buddy (chuckling).</p> Yeah, I mean [overlapping voices]</p> They are, they really are you know. And I thought you know you don't know them (chuckling) you know.</p> You really don't know.</p> Yes, that they're ill in their soul, you know they're so innocent and they're naive and they're so beautiful and all this stuff you know and I just thought, you're crazy (chuckling). It doesn't take long for a child to learn his way around.</p> I mean and they catch onto the prejudices just as quick as anybody else does you know, they aren't any different (chuckling). That's really, it's lousy, it really is.</p> Yeah, right, that's true, too. I mean they'll come out and tell you, you know they hate your guts! But at least, yeah, well I don't know if that's for better, I don't know, it's, it's really kind of cruel, it really is. And it's rather of a game though, too, with children kind of. You know where they'll, well they start talking about one another or talking about one another's mother or something you know, and it's a game that they're playing. [0:46:06.4]</p> But I think you know like some of them are really, they have feelings and they really get upset [overlapping voices]</p> ...about the whole thing and they take it very personally and they get hurt. And you know they just have no concept of the fact you know that they're hurting.</p> Yeah, right, other people's feelings, they you know they couldn't care, they could not care (chuckling) and as long as they have the last word (chuckling).</p> Okay.</p> Let's wait till Monday.</p>",2
1000133840.txt,"How you doing?</p> All right, I guess. I mean...yeah. How was your weekend?</p> I haven't done anything. I've got to start [thinking of] (ph) unpacking. We just - Sunday - I didn't realize Monday was a holiday. It just slipped me. And Sunday we were all going to go to the dunes; my roommates and Don and I and all these people. And so we were waiting around for everybody Sunday morning. And it became an extreme hassle just waiting around people were going off. Don and I [went outside and said] (ph) to hell with this crap and we decided to go to the County. So we put some stuff together and went up there and didn't come back till last night. And it was really nice to just get out of the city. And I had a nice weekend. Monday wasn't as nice as it could have been. And driving back was a real bummer. Traffic was bad. So we stayed at my folks house Monday night. And I was just thinking driving over here I really hadn't even thought about - and it struck me coming over here, it must all be due to ending Friday anyway, but I hadn't thought about anything. Like for a couple of weeks while we were meeting, I was very consciously aware of coming here and conscious of things that happened that I thought were very worthwhile for me to talk about. And I guess as the end approaches I don't think about it. [2:01]</p> Yeah. And the other thing that I thought of coming over was I guess there was - I don't know what it is. Kind of a decision not to want to talk about anything or not be conscious of anything very deep or difficult to deal with kind of thing.</p> ...finished.</p> Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. So that kind of thing is sort of - I guess there was a consciousness of that as I was coming over this afternoon. I guess things are really mixed up all over just in terms of leaving Chicago and getting ready to get out of here and planning on the trip and all. I've finally come to decide that I'll be back in August. At first I told Don I'd be back by the first and then I sat down and looked -</p> Of August. Then I sat down and looked at where we were going and tried to figure out time wise and figured that I'd really be cutting myself if I tried to make it back by the first so I decided the fifteenth of August would be a good time to come back. And I think he's trying very hard to grapple with that. [3:34]</p> Yeah. And understand my going and all. In fact just this afternoon we sat down and talked - also that and this retreat this weekend with the people from Albany. I think I mentioned that we were excluding husbands, wives and all that.</p> No, this is this weekend. So we went out with Gary and his wife Saturday night and had a really, really nice time with them. And I guess at some point Don and Gary got a chance to talk together. And I guess he started saying to Gary that he really wanted to come this weekend. And I was a little perturbed at that because we had talked about it and I had said, ""Look, no people are coming other than the staff,"" and I said - and he couldn't understand that. I said, ""Part of it is there's a lot of work to be done. Many of us are kind of spreading out for the summer and it's sort of a thing that we want to conclude together."" And he found that really hard to accept. And he mentioned it Saturday night. And I guess at some point they were talking and Gary said, well, he'd see what could be done. And I know that was said as not wanting to just put someone down and say no but trying to be nice about it. And I said, ""Don't count on it."" I said, ""I don't think-"" And then he got really defense about, ""Well, what's going on?"" [5:02]</p> Yeah, and again I don't know this might be my own paranoia, ""What's going on between you and Gary that I can't come? What's this group supposed to be that no one else can come?"" And just haven't said much about because I'm not sure whether it's my own paranoia. He sort of created a lot of guilt feelings in me this weekend about that whole thing with Gary.</p> Well, I talked about the summer and I'd be gone all summer and his going out with other girls and all. I said, ""You know that's fine. I think it's a good idea. It's crazy if you try and seclude yourself and all that kind of jazz."" And he made it clear - I don't remember how - but in one way or another I got a clear understanding that he wouldn't be having any kind of sexual relations with anyone. But he'd be going out. And things like that that made me guilty about even considering -</p> Yeah. So I think what sort of happened is that I've decided that he's going to be around that that's just not going to work. And I'll feel too uncomfortable if we try to work something out; Gary and I to get together. And that it is best left the way it is. The kind of discomfort it will create for me and for Don probably too in an indirect way isn't worth it. [7:08]</p> Yeah. I guess I only consciously decided that or really looked at it. We talked last Friday and I didn't really come to terms with dealing with that over the weekend.</p> Yeah and I haven't until this morning. I wrote a letter to a very, very close friend of mine in Connecticut. And I was telling her about the whole situation as it had come up. And as I wrote it, it sort of just clarified for me ways of dealing with that and not carrying through the potential that exists there.</p> Yeah. Yeah. Right.</p> No. I feel much better about it.</p> No, I don't think I'm ready to deal with a relationship except for Don and I. I don't think I'm ready to deal with that. I don't think our relationship is such that I can deal with it. I don't think I'm at point where I can deal with it and be comfortable about it and feel completely good about it. That some of those comfortable feelings I had had are gone as a result of some of the guilt that Don has created in me. And I think he's more important to focus on than Gary is.</p> Yeah. Yeah. I really don't. And I think some of it is just the excitement of that kind of presenting itself as an experience. And as it comes closer to realization, I'm not ready to handle that. I kind of would like to see if someday I could that and not feel guilty about it; not have it hurt Don and my relationship but just be a comfortable thing. And at this point I'd like to see that happen but I don't care too much if it does. It's not that important. I think part of that - like when we were at my folks house Monday night and yesterday. My mom and I went shopping yesterday looking for something to wear for the wedding. And then yesterday afternoon in the early evening we went through a big hassle about the wedding. My brother won't let us have it at his house. So my father turns toward having it inside again. And I found myself being really bitter that that's one thing I had really demanded. And I had said, ""I'm not going to go through the hassle. If it becomes a hassle I just won't do it."" And I came to recognition, hassle or not, man, I'm fighting for that. I really want that. [10:42]</p> Yeah. Yeah. It just occurred to me now that as there's an issue at home with the wedding and all I'm not disturbed at all any longer about the situation around the abortion and not being able to share with him. And I don't know if this is good or not but it's almost as though that whole experience hasn't happened.</p> Yeah, it's almost as though it never happened. It just was so fast really. What was it? A week and a half, two weeks at the most that that whole crisis was. And I was writing Ana telling her that everything had worked out alright except for a couple of days afterward feeling really down everything was fine. And it just is almost as though it never happened.</p> I guess well it does in the sense that that was a huge thing for me to go through, you know?</p> Oh, yeah. Maybe it's because lots of times when crisis's occur they aren't just resolved.</p> Yeah.</p> And I guess depending on what it does to you psychologically, but I really feel as though that was -</p> No. It's like I feel very much the same as I felt before. Maybe a little more experienced in the world kind of thing. But it's just like it never occurred and I guess that's - you know usually crisis's carry over in some way or another. And it's just sort of strange that that's [just over and gone with.] (ph) And it doesn't disturb me at all except in the sense that that was a really big crisis.</p> No, I don't feel it does at all. And I think part of it is there are so many things I'm looking forward to right now. I've got all these maps out and I've got everything planned where we're going.</p> Oh! God, I just can't wait. I'm looking at the map and following it out to Denver and to Glacier Base, and actual park where I've been. And I just absolutely love the place. And then moving on to Salt Lake City and then up. God! I just can't wait to leave. And I still don't feel - only when Don gives me these strange looks and talks about it do I feel guilty about going. [15:18]</p> Yeah. I'm almost afraid it - I want to talk about it so bad.</p> Yeah. Like I want to talk about it where we're going. And I feel like I can't. It just rubs it in that he's not going. It's been kind of hard to keep quiet. And I've tried to do that. And I guess I sort of keep quiet about it.</p> Yeah, I really do. Yeah. I don't know - I guess I'm sort of not knowing what I want to talk about now and Friday. I really don't know how to use the time up.</p> Well, I don't - [yeah, I feel at a loss because I don't have anything to say. I don't feel uncomfortable about it. ] (ph)</p> Oh, kind of a neat thing - I don't know if it's neat but I kind of felt good about it - Sunday when we all up and decided immediately to leave, Daisy got really, really upset about it. She was really looking forward to getting out and then she said something, ""Well, this was all planned for you."" And I said, ""What do you mean it was planned for me?""</p> Going to the dunes. The Indiana dunes. Jill and Kevin went and Kerrie and Jack, the other couple that we had that party for Friday night and this other couple went. And I said, ""What do you mean it's all planned for me? You and Jill were the ones talking about going and I said, ""Yeah, it sounds like a great idea. I'd like to go. Don and I would probably like to go too."" And she said, ""Well Jill and I wanted to do something for you and Don kind of thing and that was going to be it."" And I said, ""Oh, well, I didn't know."" And then as she talked on, nothing really was planned to do for us anyway because of the other party. They just didn't have time for anything else. So then I started to feel guilty about going. And Don and I sat around for about ten minutes, ""Well what in the hell are we going to do? Should we go or shouldn't we go?""</p> Yeah. Yeah. And I finally said, ""I guess I ought to check with Daisy because Jill was out getting something to go. I guess what I feel good about is - I don't if I'd have done this a while back. Maybe I would have anyway but I felt like it was an uncomfortable situation. I went to talk to Daisy just to confront the situation and deal with it. I don't know if I'd have been dealing with it last fall. And I went in and said, ""Daisy, wow, I'm not sure what's going on? Do we really put a wrench in everything if we take off? I don't want to wreck some plans that you've got made."" And she'd been crying and she was really upset about it.</p> Well, I didn't know. And as it turned out it was more just the whole frustration of sitting around having to wait for everybody to get together to take off. She was just so anxious to get out of there. And our deciding, ""Well, we're not going to sit around and wait for you guys anymore. We're leaving and we're not going there, we're going someplace else."" I think it just hit her in terms of, ""Let's get the hell out of here!"" So it wasn't so much our not going, as it was just wanting to leave the city for a while anyway. And I felt like I was able to confront her with it and feel okay about it and be able to leave without-</p> Yeah. Yeah. And I guess it worked out all right. I haven't heard anything from anybody coming back. It occurred to me while we were gone. I wonder if everyone was angry with us for taking off. And in one sense I really didn't care. The only one I really cared got hurt by our leaving or felt bad about it was Daisy. The rest of them I guess I don't have that much feelings about. [20:39]</p> Yeah. Probably not. I just really kind of avoid dealing with them all. The party Friday night went pretty well. We had a ton of food left over. Nothing else happened. That worked out all right. And it seems like I'm not even there anymore. Like our leaving Sunday and we didn't come back until last night and Jill and Kevin had friends over so we really didn't talk with them very much. I didn't see Daisy until today. I just don't feel like I [live] (ph) there anymore.</p> Yeah, I'm going to be gone all this weekend. And I feel like all I'm really there for is to mechanically pack up and leave.</p> Well, I guess not - I had hoped we could leave by the fifteenth, Tuesday.</p> No, a week from next Tuesday.</p> Yeah, a week from the following Tuesday. But Daisy's got to go home so we probably won't leave until around the eighteenth which is Friday. And I'm moving out the Sunday right after graduation, which is the thirteenth.</p> I've got to move all my furniture. It's going to be moved to my brother's house. And then I'll probably go up to Don's for a couple of days and then make some kind of arrangement to meet Daisy someplace and pick her up and just take off. Jill's leaving this Friday and won't be back until the following Saturday. And won't really be living -</p> Yeah. And that's what it is. And everybody's just sort of dispersing. And that's the place where I feel least bad about leaving from. In fact right now, this minute, I don't feel bad about leaving any place. A strange thing that hit me the other day was that this friend - sort of friend - I'd been in high school with is getting married and sent me an invitation to her wedding. Just really strange [that I would be invited to her wedding.] (ph) And what it brought back to me was thoughts of friends all around. Friends that are somewhat distance in the sense of closeness now besides friends that are close but far away. And it was as though I had a feeling I was leaving all of that. Leaving everything behind. And the approaching wedding was sort of a final kind of a culmination of just leaving everything else behind and not caring whether I hurt some people accept for very close friends or talk to them or even let them know that I was getting married kind of thing. [24:23]</p> No. Not at all. I really just don't care about them. And I don't feel bad about that either. That's just the way things are [moving along right here.] (ph) Like even waiting around for graduation is just sort of a mechanical thing to happen. And I don't know that it has much significance either. Like yesterday, this one class I have was missing the departing from friends from school. And having that been missed it's like I've said goodbye by not being there. By not being around for that. And I don't know if it's - it's sort of a sense of leaving something unfinished because I wasn't there for the last class. And yet the [unfinishedness] (sp?) isn't too severe because there's only one or two people there that I wish to make departing comments to. And it's all - and as people are having parties next weekend and stuff like that, I'm not very concerned about even being there. They've become pretty insignificant kind of. [26:52]</p> Ooh, you've got more time than I do.</p> I guess for me it's like this leaving is that I've got all this free time. I've got all my work done.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I guess I suspected -</p> Yeah. I guess it's different to have been in a place for a longer time and leaving people here or if everybody you're close to is sort of scattering too. It makes it a lot easier. [28:59]</p> Yeah. I don't know if I ever take time to think about missing people. I guess here the only person I really thought about missing is Gary. And I have some friends at work that are - well they were very, very close friends of mine from college - who are around here. In the last year, we've lost some of the close touches that we have had and so I don't feel as though I'm really leaving them at all.</p> Because that's the most hurtful kind of separation is a gradual kind of thing.</p> Uh-hmm. It just occurred to me that some of the most (inaudible@ 30:23) I guess it's just been thrown at me a lot too; separation and termination and all this kind of jazz. It's thrown at me a lot more in the last three weeks than ever before when I was leaving. And someone was saying about you know when you leave some close friends behind or in moving on what really becomes tragic about it or kind of negative is not being able to move on to new friends, new relationships. [Just bemoaning the fact that other people close to you are-] (ph) I kind of feel like that's what having kept in touch with some people I went to college with by their being here for a short period of time on and off has somewhat kept me from that moving on while I've been in Chicago. Although, now that's been worked through and I feel much more ready to move on and want to make new friends and meet new people. And I guess as I look towards the fall being really beginning to do that it'll be kind of more exciting sharing that growth with Don getting to know new people through him and just together. It sets up a whole new dimension to meeting people and building relationships with people. I almost feel as though right now I've been overexposed to separation kind of thing. [32:12]</p> Yeah, camping trip and -</p> Yeah, I went once. And I remember towards the end of the week - it was a week thing - I remember crying towards the end of the week partially out of homesickness and partially out of leaving. And I guess they do throw that at you there. I never thought of that before. I guess that happens. But I guess I think of a week at summer camp as a pretty short time to at least for me to develop the kinds of relationships that carry on.</p> Yeah. Yeah, I was only at summer camp for a week.</p> No, I've never done that. I guess the only kind of summer camp would have been like Upward Bound. And certainly that carried a lot of impact when I left. And again when I separated from Upward Bound they had this great, big, huge celebration for me. And leaving was kind of just this huge gigantic thing. It was really, really weird. And it was drawn out for weeks in the sense that I was going to leave and then somebody offered me some money to stay around for the rest of the summer. So they postponed this big party they had until the end of the summer. So it's probably more of a thing for them because they had all this stuff ordered and had to freeze this cake for six weeks. I guess that was a big separation thing. I don't feel like talking about that. That's just an overemphasis on it. [34:41]</p> Yeah. And I guess there really isn't. I think about anxieties about getting a job but again that's in the distance.</p> Yeah, it does. On one hand except people keep throwing at me, ""You can't find a job. It's really hard to get a job. They just don't exist. You better get on your tail and get something done about it!"" And I just really don't -</p> No, not at all. I'm supposed to be getting a resume all developed so that Don can pass it around and that kind of thing. I haven't even really done that or focused on doing that. I'm just not very anxious about it. I'm sort of in the sense of I was talking about last week some time about the security of the fall and I had wanted to face the summer with insecurity approaching when the trip was over. And I guess it's that being that now I'm able to sit and I'll take that when it comes kind of feeling or attitude. And I don't like the thought of I'm now being pressured that I should get a job. Have all that security waiting for me. And I feel like I really ought to be because as I look at the funds between Don and I it's not going to be very pleasant in the fall if I don't have a job waiting. But I still can't get that excited about it. [36:24]</p> Oh, I'm sure it will be in the fall. It's liable to hit me in the face.</p> Oh, God!</p> Yeah, particularly with that in between time. What a horrible thing to spend your summer on.</p> What are you writing it on? What is it?</p> Wow. And is it like just research experimental kinds of stuff?</p> Yeah. I always thought, ""God!"" That's just such an overwhelming undertaking to write a dissertation.</p> Yeah, but the analysis is a pretty big part of it.</p> That was my whole thing thinking about graduate school. I could never go anyplace where I'd have to write a thesis or into a school that would require that because writing is the biggest chore that I could face.</p> Yeah. Yeah. [Are you going to be out East to work on it?] (ph)</p> Where are you going to be?</p> Oh, wow! That's really cool! That's great.</p> [I hope you'll be motivated to write and dictate in two acres of] (ph) wow! That's really nice. That's really nice. I guess I always let that tension take over me about writing. And it's really done that to me this year. Last spring I had a paper due in research and I found research was boring for me. And I wasn't carrying out anything that was really significant anyway. And in fact, the course I'd had on research before that didn't really help me understand what the hell research was anyway. So I put it off and I took an incomplete and I was going to do it last summer. Well, summer took over and I just couldn't deal with it. And it was the most difficult thing to write that. And it had to get written last fall. And that was a short twenty page paper.</p> Then it's all done.</p> Yeah. Even for me though doing those kinds of things - like this paper that I finally just finished that was due from last quarter. I had my material together in a very clear way that at least part of it was reporting what I had discovered in reading and stuff and my own experience. And that's the kind of thing that should be very easily - I should be spending more time on analyzing what that all meant to me. What it means in practice or whatever. And even writing down material from someone else and doing all that kind of stuff was a chore - was just an awful chore. I guess writing has become even more difficult for - the only thing I really enjoy writing is letters. [4:127]</p> You hate writing them?</p> If I have - I'm in the mood.</p> Yeah, I have to be motivated.</p> Yeah. I guess I can get myself motivated easier for that kind of that than the other thing. Like Ana, the girl I wrote this morning, the girl that lived with me last year. And we became very, very close friends. I didn't know her before I came to Chicago. I guess that was a strange experience that I had never met her. And the man that kind of talked me into going to school here introduced me to her. And we decided to room together. And it was really strange how quickly we became friends. I certainly don't get close to people or let them get close to me in that short of time. And sitting down to write that letter I'd been working up to doing that for a week. And I sat down and wrote for over an hour. And that's the kind that I really enjoy writing but that's the kind I really have to be motivated for. [42:41]</p> Yeah. Yeah. Because I have a lot of things to say and I want to be really in the mood to say them all.</p> Yeah. One thing I like about writing letters is I always sit down and write them as though I'm talking to someone. And I never finish sentences and I start out in the middle of a sentence and do all this kind of stuff. And I use to get comments back from some people. They didn't understand what I was saying at all because I was thinking and talking and just writing it down rather than thinking about it, completing it and then putting it down. But I find that a more fun way of doing it.</p> Maybe that's part of what's really hard to write papers is that if I felt really free to do that. And I can't. Nobody would understand what it was. They wouldn't know what was being said. I don't know if we should meet any longer today.</p> Yeah, I guess so.</p> Okay.</p>",0

I don't know who it was.</p> My classroom. </p> No. (Laughing) My classroom. I call it my room. My classroom. Their room it should be really. But you know, my room. And they've had a couple of them broke some shades. And then someone stole-</p> Yeah right. They must have been. That's right. They probably were pulling them down because they didn't want anyone to see them change. Well they pulled them down and pulled them off. (Laughs) So I don't know who did it. I'd like to find out. (Chuckling) [0:04:07.7]</p> When they have the whole neighborhood selling candy who is going to buy the candy? It doesn't make any sense. </p> Oh.</p> Yeah, well.</p> Yeah that's for sure. In fact some of the kids didn't even feel like doing it. They said, ""No I don't want to."" And I said, ""You know well that's okay."" Or their parents said no. Well I can't blame them. If your kid is going to go from door to door selling candy. </p> I had to do enough of it myself. Like going to a parochial school you're selling something everyday of the year practically. You know? With newspapers and turkey raffles. (Laughs) Oh it was really a joke. So we used to go into taverns and catch some drunk. (Chuckling) Who would buy a box of candy from you. Yeah that's how they used to make their money. </p> But she said yes she really could be hurt. </p> Yeah I didn't want to go to bed. Like if I just said, ""I don't feel like going to bed."" </p> And she said yes she would be hurt. So.</p> Yeah. Like. Yeah.</p> No. And she said something about like the way I had been toward her before I started this therapy, it was kind of like an antagonistic attitude. </p> And she says having this before and then being told you know she would feel that it would be still maybe like an attitude. An antagonistic attitude. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Right. Right. Being kind of antagonistic toward her. And I said, ""No."" I said, ""You know it really wouldn't be any, it's not like I wouldn't love you or anything else like that."" </p> No no. </p> Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. But and she said that she would try to understand. You know. But, I don't know. And I said, ""If you were to tell me that you didn't feel like going to bed, I don't think I'd be hurt."" </p> You know. I just feel well, you know, she just doesn't want to. I don't think I would really be hurt. But I think, and then I said, it's like maybe again the old story where it's the woman's prerogative. [0:08:14.6]</p> To say, ""No I don't feel like going to bed."" And then the man just saying, ""Oh well, okay."" </p> She is the one that is giving or something. It says if, you know.</p> Yeah. Right. Yeah.</p> Right. Yeah.</p> Yeah right. Uh-huh. Right.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> I don't think it's, no it's still very prevalent. </p> It's still, like it's still here. I believe at any rate. (Chuckles) </p> Really. </p> Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah right. </p> Yeah right. Yeah right. Yeah. But I can see, I'm just going to have to say it. I just don't feel like it. And if it does hurt her, I'm sorry. But that's the way it is. If I don't feel like it then I just don't feel like it. But well. And at any rate we shall see. You know what the story is going to be. Because like I enjoy doing a lot of other things with her too. Besides going to bed. </p> So. I was surprised she said yes she would be hurt. (Chuckles) [0:10:11.6]</p> No well that's all right. Or I understand. Or something like that. I figured she was just being honest. But I really was, I was kind of surprised. (Chuckles)</p> Yeah.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah right. Yeah. Uh-huh. </p> No. (Laughs) </p> Yeah right. Just like right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Right. (Laughs) But at any rate. Then I said, like you had said, we're both kind of fairly new at the game. And you have to become adjusted to it and stuff like that. And she agreed to that. So. </p> Um.</p> No. In fact it left me feeling kind of well. I was really kind of apprehensive about even saying it. So like when after I said it I felt kind of good. </p> Like at least I said it. </p> Because I was really kind of, it really was-</p> Yeah. It was really on my mind. And I just really wasn't, know how I was going to go about saying it. But after I said it, it was kind of like it was over with and it was kind of a relief. (Laughs) But maybe it should've.</p> Like her saying, ""Yes it would upset me."" Maybe it should've upset me. </p> You know that she had said this. [0:12:09.8]</p> No it didn't. It really didn't. Right. It really didn't. And I just said, ""Well if it does. It does."" </p> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm. Yeah right. Yeah. She really had no other choice. Really. (Laughs) Certainly if I don't feel like having intercourse I'm not going to be able to have intercourse. So. (Laughs) That's the whole thing. But at any rate it was said. Did you ever use any other method besides the [Rogerian]? </p> No? I would be interested, like if you were to say to me what you really thought of me. Just from your point of view.</p> And then like I said to myself, ""Well who knows someone better than himself?"" (Laughs) You know? </p> Who knows someone better than himself? [0:14:09.7]</p> Yeah it really is. </p> Mm-hmm. </p> Mm-hmm. But I was just curious.</p> I don't know if I was looking for, if you were going to say well, I thought, ""Well if he criticized me, how would I take that?"" </p> Yeah right. If you observe something more about me that I wasn't aware of. And if you were to say to me, like if you were to say to me, ""Oh you're rotten."" Or something like this.</p> I was interested to think how I would take it.</p> If I would just-</p> Yeah right. If you were to put me down. And I would kind of, if it would really bother me. (Laughs)</p> But if it would bother me, I think if you said something, if it would really bother me then I'd probably do something to correct it. </p> Because again like I said that's the type of a person I am. Where if someone says something to me, or gives me a push-</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah right. Uh-huh. Then I try to-</p> (Laughing)</p> Yeah.</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh.</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.</p> That's true. That's true. I think it's better. Like if someone were to just criticize someone or something, they found something really wrong with them, if they really tell them about it.</p> It's like this man who I work for. He's such a a**. If he finds, he's the type that if you really-he wouldn't come up and tell you. If you heard it, you heard it second or third hand. Like, oh that bas***d. But I think if he would, you just really wouldn't feel -  like you'd probably go about trying to correct yourself. </p> I really resent that. Where they keep everything so hush hush. And secretive. And stuff like that. </p> Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah right. </p> Yeah right.</p> Right. Yeah. </p> Uh-huh.</p> Yes.</p> Yes. Yes. Right. That's why I think that's really basically a number of people's problems. No one comes up and says anything. </p> Yeah right. </p> Yeah. Yeah. Really. That's the truth. It's like they're supposed to know whether they're supposed to be holding a summer school at the school. Where I teach at. </p> And this man hasn't said nothing to nobody. Except his few little close clique. Oh my God. The school is black. So we have, we refer to it as the people who are he gets along with in his little clique, they're the house ni**ers, and the rest of us are field ni**ers. </p> (chuckling) The field ni**ers haven't been asked to teach summer school. (Laughs) And we have-[0:18:34.2]</p> Yeah right. Yeah right. Everybody's black. Except me. (Laughs) But I'm still like a field ni**er. And the field ni**ers aren't, they're not asked to work for the summer. Which is really kind of lousy. But that's the game he plays. </p> No one other. Me and another woman. </p> No. It's beautiful. Like it's been really nice. </p> Yeah. They would. Yeah they would. Yeah really. Well I think even the teachers just getting along; I just get along with most of them beautifully. They're really a great group of people. It's really interesting. (Chuckles) We always have a good time. (Laughs) My parents find it, just go (Inaudible at 0:19:44.4).</p> Yeah right. And the people say, ""My God! You're crazy!"" </p> Yeah right. What are you doing there? And it's really nice. (Laughing) I really like it. ""Oh you go into that neighborhood everyday?"" (Laughs) Oh it's really a kick. It really is. It's so funny. I said, ""Yes everyday."" Then my Mother throws out unsubtle hints every once in awhile. ""Are you planning on staying?"" (Laughs) [0:20:20.7]</p> Oh yeah right.</p> No really.</p> Really. That's the truth. </p> Yeah the middle classy black. The mink ghetto it's referred to. (Laughs) That's what it's called. And we have a white principal of course too. Not for long I hope. But the house ni**ers, the field ni**ers always have a good time. But that really kind of bugged me. Yesterday was kind of like there were a lot of things. The fact (Inaudible at 0:21:19.2) the summer school program. There's one teacher in the school who's an adjustment teacher. And she's really a nice looking woman. And she sits there all day and does nothing. </p> Just nothing. Absolutely nothing. And you're in there working your a** off. And she comes by, comes out at three fifteen looking like she just walked in. We're just dragging out.</p> Oh she's really something else. </p> Mm?</p> Oh I could give her plenty of work to do. If she was looking for work, just come around. But she just knows how to deal with men. </p> So that's what she does. Which really bugs the hell out of ya. Like yesterday, I kind of resented the fact that we had to sell the candy. [0:22:18.0]</p> I really thought that, like I'm tired of doing other jobs. I just wasn't trained to sell candy. You know what I mean? I'm not a candy salesman. So please don't ask me to sell candy. I just can't buy it. I don't care if it's for-</p> I don't want to sell it. I can't buy it. Really.</p> And collecting money and just getting all this candy straight and crap and-</p> Right! Yeah! </p> Uh-huh. So I was walking out the door and this adjustment teacher who doesn't do sh*t says to me, ""Oh Connor. Would you like to buy a box of candy?"" And I said, ""Don't start Kathleen. Just don't start."" (Laughs) Because I knew if I would have said something to her-I just had to keep on going. If I would have said something to her it really would've been rotten. (Chuckles) Because she doesn't have to sell any candy. </p> I do. It just really teed me off to no end. I mean if I have any really pressing psychological problems I'll (Inaudible at 0:23:43.4). (Laughs) </p> No I don't. There really isn't anything that I really feel depressed about today. I was thinking about worrying. And I thought, if nobody did worry, no one would get anything done. But it sure would be a hell of a nice place to live. </p> Any, like in the world. If no one worried about what they were going to do. </p> It really would be a hell of a world. But it would really be kind of a nice place to live. </p> Right. (Laughs)</p> Yeah right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I mean there's so many other places. Well even within this country, they say in the South they just go along. And they're really-</p> Yeah much slower. Relaxed pace. Which is really maybe what I need. (Laughing) Of course then I'd probably go out of my mind. (Laughs)</p> Yeah. Oh Tanya says the Bahamas is unbelievable. They just go along. You go into a restaurant and it takes you about a half hour for a cup of coffee. And no one really is concerned about it. If you get it, okay. If you don't, well that's okay too. </p> They probably would enjoy life a hell of a lot more. </p> Yeah I think that the thing is that everyone, I mean within the city and stuff -  I don't know if it's a sense of responsibility or a sense of getting money. I just think that a sense of responsibility is instilled in you when you're living within a city all your life. Where you have to do this. And you have to do that. And you have to do this. </p> And you have to be here at a certain time. And you have to be there at a certain time. And it's just if you're not, well you're in trouble. </p> I can understand people -  I'd be pissed if someone, like if someone wasn't going to be there or something. I would be rather upset. I was talking to Ana downstairs and she said something about they're starting a thing at the Central Park Bank. </p> What's this?</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> The auspicious eye. </p> (Laughing)</p> Huh.</p> Mm-hmm. That sounds good.</p> Yeah.</p> Really.</p> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p> Really.</p> Mm-hmm. But they're going to use the basic set up also? I think, what is it? There's one South. The NY City Bank or something.</p> But I think, I don't know if it's all group counseling or just-</p> Yeah yeah right.</p> Oh I see.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah.</p> What are they going to use for a budget?</p> Oh I see.</p> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p> Salary. </p> Oh I see. </p> I know. I've heard. Well it's a good idea at any rate. [0:30:32.9]</p> I hope it works out. </p> Oh I see.</p> Mm. Is that the big one? It's an old building? I'm trying-</p> Yeah right. Right. It's right on the corner. </p> Right. Right. Yeah. Have they even got any funds as far as the government is concerned?</p> Good. Well it's the University itself that is closing this place down. </p> I mean they were the ones-they probably did have the money they just didn't want to - .</p> Really. Uh-huh.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Mm.</p> Oh.</p> Uh-huh. They've gotten enough money to build a building next door they should have enough. </p> (Laughing)</p> Building named after them.</p> (Laughing)</p> When you're thinking about it, they all have. I just think it's the buildings. And-</p> Yeah. (Laughs) </p> Who cares? I mean who really cares? If a building is named after you or not. If you're a dead person, they come around (Inaudible at 0:33:46.1). </p> They put up a nice little piece of sculpture outside of the building. </p> Yeah. I don't know what it's supposed to signify. (Inaudible) Weird.</p> Yeah. It really is. Isn't it for international studies?</p> I'm still interested in what happens to all these studies and all this research. I just wouldn't even know what happens to it. </p> Yeah. And that's it. Journals and books and that's it. </p> That get stuck on the shelves. </p> Right. In some of these boxes. And it doesn't really seem to do a hell of a lot of good. </p> It really doesn't. When you think about the thousands and thousands and millions and millions of dollars that are spent on research. </p> It does. Yeah.</p> Right. Right. I think there ought to be a little more practicality in the whole business. I think it has a note of prestige about the whole thing. Which a lot of people look for. </p> Yeah right. And you know the whole country wants to maintain this thing. And it's really sad. There just isn't enough. I mean if you aren't a scholar you're fine. But there is a hell of a lot more people than there are scholars. </p> This morning I really would've liked Tanya-I really had an urge to have sex. </p> And it really would've been nice if Tanya were here. And then I thought, ""Oh, you know, well I'll see her later on this week."" </p> And I'm thinking, ""Oh Christ. What's going to happen when she's going to be gone all summer?""</p> Like wow. (Laughs)</p> Right.</p> Yeah. And I thought I would just, if she's going to be pissed off (Inaudible at 0:37:31.0). Just go out and find some girl. Start taking other girls out. </p> Yeah. I would. Then I thought-because I wouldn't want to fall back into the homosexual activity stuff.</p> Right. Which would be the easiest way out. </p> And I just said, ""No."" </p> No. (Chuckles)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah right. To me, definitely.</p> Yeah right. Yeah that's true. She'd probably be pissed off about it more.</p> Yeah right. Really. Really.</p> I'm not going to sit around all summer.</p> Yeah right.</p> Yeah.</p> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. </p> Right. </p> No. It doesn't. </p> That's true too. I never really-no it doesn't. </p> Yeah right. Yeah. </p> Uh-huh. No it doesn't. It really doesn't. </p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Because I don't think it would really bother me. Like the thing is if I said something to a girl. </p> And if she said like go to hell or something like this or just immediate shut down, shot down; I don't think it would really bother me.</p> Right. Really. Really.</p> Uh-huh. </p> Yeah right. Really.</p> Truthfully. Truthfully. Yeah. I guess I just won't say anything to her about intentions of taking out other women while she's gone to Spain. I thought it was rather selfish on her part anyway. (Chuckles) [0:40:10.5]</p> She leaves the country what am I supposed to do?</p> Yeah right.</p> Stay there and don't go anywhere.</p> Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Really which is kind of impossible if you ask me.</p> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But she would probably-I don't know. They say women always do wait and all this stuff. Of course they don't. </p> Yeah. </p> Right. Some do. Some don't. But I don't know what her-if she does. She probably wouldn't say anything to be about it. So I wouldn't be concerned about if I didn't know anything about it. I'm not going to be worried about it. (Chuckles) I'm thinking about all the old college girls and if they're all married. (Laughs) </p> Right. Who's left? (Laughs)</p> Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah right. Really. </p> No I don't. In fact I think it may be kind of interesting to see what happens as far as I'm concerned. </p> Right.</p> Right. Presents a whole new outlook. (Laughs) Really. [0:42:30.2]</p> Uh-huh. </p> Yeah right. There was a man in school who was an exterminator. And he was exterminating all around and all this stuff. And I guess he was supposed-all the women thought he was really good looking. And they were just carrying on and so and all this stuff.</p> He was talking to this woman I work with, Kathleen-</p> Yeah she's, well she's nice looking yeah.</p> Oh no no no. No no no. This is another - Kathleen. </p> And she said-you know they were talking about it and he had talked to her. And he had noticed the whole teachers-we're all putting on this play like together. And he said that he had written some plays. And that he was a bachelor. And he was really interested in getting married. And he was even interested in getting married to someone who already had a family and all this stuff. </p> And they were talking about it. And they said, ""Well either, number one he's lying."" ""Or he's"", as they termed, ""a little funny."" And I thought to myself, ""Is that really true?"" Like that's the first thing they say if a man is like over 30.</p> And if he's anything halfway decent. Or if he's supposed to be looking so good. If he's anything over 30 they think something's really wrong with him. </p> Yeah the fact that he isn't married. You know something is really wrong with him. </p> Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah.</p> Yeah. And I just thought to myself it's possible. But I don't-maybe it isn't true. </p> Yeah right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. [0:44:36.3]</p> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</p> Yeah. But they just felt that like everybody should be married. (Chuckling) In fact this one woman said to me, ""What are you doing? How do you (inaudible at 0:44:53.7)? How are you still able to be single? Why haven't you been caught?"" As the old saying goes. What are you still doing around? (Chuckling) Free. (Laughs) And said, ""Like now I'm really getting-I really enjoy it."" And I really do now. Because it's really kind of nice. In fact I'm thinking there really isn't-well as far as marriage is concerned the only thing that I'm missing now would be the fact that if you really wanted someone to be there. They wouldn't be there. </p> But as far as anything else is concerned companionship would be the only thing that would be missing. </p> Which is important. But I was thinking to myself if I would really want to be with someone or not be with someone. Like if I would want to be alone more often than I would like to be with someone. </p> Then I was thinking as far as my day is concerned I'm really with someone most of the day.</p> But as far as the rest is concerned I don't know. Weekends would be the only problem that would really bother me. Would be the only time that it really would bother me. Would be weekends. Because the weekdays just the job and everything about it you're always doing something. But weekends I think would be the only time it would really bother me. </p> Okay. </p> Mm-hmm.

1004824723.txt,"I brought the letter today with me, but –</p> Okay.</p> Yeah.</p> So you subtract it after—?</p> Yeah, sure. I'll go back and look at it.</p> Okay.</p> Yeah, sure.</p> Yeah. They said it's not billable (ph).</p> Yeah, sure.</p> Um, okay. (laughs) But if I have any more questions, um, could be. (laughs) So I think last time you were saying something important and then we ran out of time. I was thinking—I was very curious about what you meant. I think you were talking about associations, um, and that kind of like a big deal for me, like I operate based on them, so I just wanted—I don't know if you remember what we were talking about. [00:2:04]</p> I think we were talking about expansiveness and I was making that list –</p> and you said something and I didn't quite understand what that was.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, and then you said something about associations as well. Like does it mean like your studies, of course, as well you may know about associations—does it mean if I associate certain qualities with one person or in one landscape, does that mean that all other people and landscapes are kind of removed from that association? Is that the danger of associations?</p> Like if I think, ""Oh, expansiveness can only be Victor's qualities,"" does that mean that no one else will—cause that's just my association?</p> Yeah. That's a big danger cause then I don't like give anyone else, you know, the time of day. It would be like, ""Oh, you can't possibly have those qualities that I want.""</p> Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) That's not a good idea, I suppose.</p> Yeah. There was that urgency a few months ago, um, (coughs) (pause for .08 seconds) yeah, I mean, I just feel that maybe that's part of the reason why I'm sad so often—that I don't look for (pause for .02 seconds) the things that I like, (pause for .02 seconds) and the people that I already have in my life are in the places that I occupy, you know?</p> Yeah. Um hmm. I don't know. (laughs) David said something about, ""Oh, do you want to do something in the December break? Do you want to go out (inaudible at 00:05:55) and I said, ""No!"" (laughs) Like very, very—I just had this really strong reaction cause I just remembered last December. [00:06:03]</p> Well just like the previous experiences of where I remember being not very satisfied or happy with that experience, and then using the memory of that to keep myself from (pause for .02 seconds) committing to such future experiences. (laughs)</p> Is that not association? What is that?</p> (pause for .03 seconds) I just wonder what I could do about it, you know? Like, what do I do? (laughs) </p> Yeah, like he says, ""Let's go,"" what do I do? Should I say 'no' (laughs) cause I want to say 'no', or should I (pause for .02 seconds) um, give it another chance (laughs) and then regret that decision. (pause for .34 seconds) [00:13:18]</p> Yeah, and this whole thing with my apartment. I've spent, like, six or seven days of the last week at David's place, and I feel like it's absurd for me to pay rent at the Square. I keep getting tempted to call this one girl; I asked her to come look at the place if she was interested, and I think she's still interested. She could take over my lease. [00:15:10]</p> I know that's not what you want but it—I think you said yesterday you could help me do something better than that, which is to trust my experience, right? (laughs) [00:16:09]</p> (laughs) No, you don't—I'm not forcing an answer out of you (inaudible at 00:16:33) It does help me to sift through all the noise and confusion in my head.</p> Um, (pause for .02 seconds) I don't know. (laughs) I don't know if you have an answer. I know that I'll only be happy with my own, you know, what I choose for myself.</p> So, yeah. (pause for .12 seconds) But I mean, like, for general things I wonder if you have answers. (laughs)</p> Well, how relationships work or how (laughs) what can a person expect from their partner? You know, what is too much and what is just enough, or something? (laughs)</p> Yeah. (pause for .08 seconds) I feel very, like I was thinking about (inaudible at 00:17:54 to [00:17:56) and so many things, and feeling like—I was remembering that I feel dissatisfied when I think that I'm just his blah, blah, blah—his girlfriend, or his wife, or whatever. I feel that, and I feel good when I think that I have an identity of my own. [00:18:21]</p> Yeah, I do. Um, (pause for .02 seconds) but there is a much deeper, much greater sense of loneliness that I feel like no one can begin to touch. I felt like with Victor I was beginning to share that, but maybe that was just the thrill of something new. I'm not sure. [00:22:16]</p> I just don't see him as being that emotional. Um (pause for .03 seconds) it's—(laughs) and I keep telling him this—it's stinging disappointment (ph) to realize you're not very emotional. And he's trying to be equally mean or something, and he's like, ""(inaudible at 00:23:05) me too, to realize you're not an intellectual."" (laughs) But um –</p> (laughs) Well, we were just making fun. I was being mean—that's how I am to him. I consider it part of my charm (laughs) to be a little mean. Um, I don't mean him ill or anything. I mean, you know, I buy him little things and so, I'm sweet, but mean. (laughs)</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. (laughs) (pause for .07 seconds) So I guess this is probably a good reason to be confused cause you feel like you're so emotional, and how great it would be to have someone emotional to share your life with. (pause for .03 seconds) There's so many other things you want to do with your life. You want to work and you want to be—you want to achieve something. You want to go to those book launches. (laughs) [00:30:06]</p> (laughs) Um, yeah. (laughs) </p> (laughs) Yeah, I mean pretty soon I'm going to be, you know, old, and I don't think –</p> (laughs) Next year? (laughs) </p> Yeah.</p> (laughs) Yeah, see—you know. (laughs) (pause for .05 seconds) But I think, cause I have tried that and maybe it was the wrong thing to do at the time, but yeah, I was dating. (laughs) I was totally weirded out because I've never gone on blind dates and I was doing that. [00:32:12]</p> (laughs) Well, this guy who I went out with turned out to be 25, or 24, and I totally went off on him when he told his age. But he was being sweet and stuff, but still, like, (pause for .03 seconds) yeah, I mean, it's hard for me to say 'no' I guess. No to like—""No, I don't want to go to this party with you."" </p> Well, again, you know, having low self-esteem, I suppose, and feeling like this is it. Not being able to stand up for yourself. Yeah, thinking too low about yourself. (laughs) [00:34:09]</p> My neighbor?</p> Oh, yeah. Sure, um, I feel like I put that behind me. </p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Yeah, no. I mean, I definitely will—I'm open to talking about it. (pause for .02 seconds) Do we have time? Yeah, I mean, (pause for .03 seconds) in what narrative should I put it? (laughs) I'm wondering because, yeah, it happened when I was very little. Um, (pause for .02 seconds) so when I told my mom, she stopped taking me there.</p> No, it's, um, I mean I realize that my suppressed sexuality probably has something to do with this, but I feel like I'm overcoming that a little bit, um, (pause for .04 seconds) (whispers) yeah (normal voice) I'm not really sure how that—I mean I'm sure it has affected me in some ways, but I've had boyfriends so it's not like (pause for .04 seconds)—I feel like things with my dad are far more, have been far more damaging to me than that. [00:36:47]</p> (pause for .04 seconds) Yeah, I mean, (pause for .04 seconds) I feel affectionate towards him and I feel it's nice to see him, but I feel like (pause for .03 seconds)—but it's also true that I did fall in love with (inaudible at 00:30:32) (laughs) I still found something new in him, and there were reasons why. It's not just the physical attraction, you know. The stuff that I was able to share with him (pause for .03 seconds) that meant so much to me; I guess that didn't mean as much to him.</p> Why? (laughs)</p> (pause for.04 seconds) I don't know. It's not possible?</p> Yeah.</p> That makes me very sad. (pause for .04 seconds) But can I live without that feeling?</p> Yeah. I mean, that's what I mean. Like, how can I know what I want? How can I know what is more important to me and what is not important to me? That's what I'm having a really difficult time figuring out. (pause for .04 seconds) I mean, people want to be excited (ph) all the time, right? (laughs)</p> Are people excited, like, some of the time? (laughs) How often is a person excited, a normal person excited? (laughs)</p> Huh?</p> When was I excited? [00:43:00]</p> Yeah, but he's gone. (laughs) (pause for .03 seconds) But maybe I was excited because it was something new, and the novelty value had not worn off. (laughs)</p> Who?</p> Oh, he is?</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> It's not all of it? (pause for .03 seconds) What's not—what's not all of it?</p> That's exactly what I've been trying to articulate and I haven't been able to until now. And again, I feel like is my—or Victor was like, ""You're crazy,"" or whatever, ""You have—you have this insatiable need."" Well ignoring that—I feel like that is important to me—someone to understand me emotionally. You know that's what I meant when I was saying being with David, is the daily disappointment to know that he's not.—</p> Yeah. That's like me all the time or that's me because of my neurosis or because of my depression. And it's temporary to be fixed and I don't need my partner to—I'm confused about that—what you said earlier, you said in very concrete terms that this is a basic need for me. [00:46:17]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> (laughs) Yeah, it really does.</p> Okay, alright.</p> 9:00?</p> Yeah. Have a good weekend. (laughs)</p> Thank you.</p>",2
1004824737.txt,"Doing all right. Doing all right. Crazy cultures. I don't understand how PR people . . . I've been going at this shit at least ten hours a day, at least. Even right here, I got here as early as the door opens, Tweeting, fucking Facebooking, e-mails. This is going to get done. There is no way this is not going to happen. I don't give a shit if I have to beg, borrow and steal, this shit's going to get done. [00:01:01] It just doesn't make sense. It's a lot of money for people like me, but it's really not a lot of money. We're at $1300. We have 15 days. That's plenty of time. I just need people to kick in bigger chunks and then I'll do whatever I have to do to make it be done. I've been on Twitter. I'm following over 1,000 people. I've got 200 people following us—or me; whatever. I'm good at this shit. I'm targeting places. I'm being pretty good; it's good. I'm directly appealing to people. Once they follow me I say ""thank you"" for following me.</p> Do you know how this stupid Twitter thing works? It's glorified text messaging, but I'm realizing it's actually pretty amazing because it's all real time. You're a psychologist and let's say you have a Twitter account and let's say every day you post a couple of things—articles or tips for the day or whatever—and I'm like, ""I'm interested in that,"" so I would follow you. It's as if you gave me your number, but I don't have your number. Do you know what I mean? I get to follow you. You'll see that I'm following you and you're like, ""This guy has a band and I like music. I'll check it out,"" and follow me if you want. Once two people are following each other, then they can send a private message to each other. Otherwise it's public. You can be like, ""Hey, man. If you can, share the link. It would really help out."" I am working this shit like a busy Croatian hooker. (both chuckle) [00:02:58]</p> It's pretty exhausting. Also, my friend made a good point. He was like, ""You're not a PR person. You're doing this out of personal investment. You're working your ass off for something you really care about."" I had a tension headache from Sunday until yesterday. I still have it a little bit just because I'm jittery and amped up. I'm excited one minute and I'm really worried the next minute. It's a vulnerable thing. Yesterday I wrote a really tight e-mail to a shitload of– all the churches. Any important church I could get the contact of, I just wrote a whole—I was like, ""This is who I am."" [00:03:54] I gave them the whole spiel and I was like, ""I was the copyright manager of the Assyrian Weekly. I've done my part for the community. We always talk a big game about how we have to help talented Assyrians and push them. I need the community's support. This means a lot to me and I wouldn't even ask if it wasn't important to me."" I'm able to influence others. Any chance I get I educate others about Assyrian stuff. It's a platform, so by helping me they're helping . . . I did a little thing about how the culture doesn't really have much of a future if it's not supporting artists and especially in a diaspora. What kind of future is the community going to have if we're all bankers and jewelers and shit. There has to be some kind of cultural production. So I don't know. I tried to make it as brief as possible, but also very direct and just like, ""Listen . . . "" So I don't know. [00:05:00]</p> Yeah. That's what I don't like. It's just like, ""You fucking moron. These fucking dipshits,"" especially among Assyrians. I hated writing that because I know a lot of them either aren't going to get it, they're not going to care, and that fucking drives me crazy. They're so unappreciative. The best example, two great examples are System of a Down. Do you know this band, System of a Down? They're kind of like a heavy metal band. They're huge. Huge. And they're all from L.A. They're huge and awesome. Good for them. They're very genuine and they talk about cultural stuff. [00:06:04] That's fucking fantastic. The issue that I have is that everyone now is like, ""Oh, yeah. System of a Down."" These are people that if System of a Down came to [ ] (inaudible at 00:06:15), or they saw them walking down the street. They're heavy metal, like mascara, weird. They're not particularly handsome dudes and people are like, ""Look at these fucking freaks,"" you know? But the minute they're accepted by everyone else and they're a big deal, they can't wait to fucking lick their ass. That fucking rubs me the wrong way. It really does, especially when I'm a local boy, like I have worked in the general public. I have published materials. People know me. Academically, whatever. Everything I've done, I've included my heritage in it. So it's like, ""Fuck you, man. Fuck you."" That really rubs me the wrong way. I also know it just is what it is. [00:07:06] There are other talented Assyrian artists like me, of Assyrian heritage. In Assyrian there's a great saying, ""Go die, come back, and I'll love you."" (chuckles)</p> Yeah. It's a great saying. In other words, (sniggers) when I can't take you for granted, then I'll take you seriously. </p> Yeah. What? The saying or just the . . ?</p> There are a lot of good sayings like that.</p> Can you believe that shit? There's no word for fate in my culture. There is, but you know what it is? It literally means ""the letters on your forehead"", like it's written on your forehead. That's some serious shit. Can you imagine? In a way it's beautiful. I love that.</p> Yeah, there's a lot of poetic shit like that. But, yeah, there's a lot of poetic shit like that.</p> Yeah. For example, good morning is not good morning. Good morning is ""kind light"". That's the literal translation. And good night is ""kind night"", so ""may you be treated kindly"". It's very beautiful, very beautiful. </p> That's right. The other example is Chris Bohjalian, the guy that wrote Midwives. He's Armenian. He has never wrote a god-damned thing about Assyrians, but he suddenly has awoken and now his new novel is about the genocide and his [own fucking broad sisters]. (inaudible at 00:09:02) Awesome. Good for him. That's great. First of all, he's a Johnny-come-lately. Second of all, people are salivating. He's everywhere. The Assyrian National Committee is using him, of course, as well, and he's a little naïve to even understand that because he certainly doesn't need them. It's just like, man. Really? Wow. Do that. I don't care. It's not just me. There are a couple of us who have been at this shit for—not just artists. I have some academic friends—people that are really worth some notice and there's nothing. Nothing. Because if you're not in their little circle and if you're not their little foot soldier, and also if they're jealous—there's a lot of that, too. That's just a fact. Once you're that big, you're already that big, so they can now just try to be your pal, do you know what I mean? [00:10:06] But when you're in that in-between, where you need the support and you're kind of getting somewhere, there's a lot of ""who the fuck does she think she is?"" Like, ""Look at me. I'm a psychologist."" It's just pathetic, it's just fucking pathetic. And I've already decided, whether I succeed at this or not, I think I'm going to write something about this. I don't know where I can possibly publish it, but it's not just for me. There are just a lot of us. My friend, Seth, barely made his goal. The guy just wanted $3,000 or something. This is a talented band, fucking eight people, classically trained. They're combining all these Eastern European jazz sounds and he's doing all these amazing renditions and it's like are you kidding me? Who are we supposed to support? Who are these talented, smart . . . it's just mind-numbing. [00:11:10] Seth has even more of a thing than I am. He volunteers. He's very in-the-community. I'm in the community in the sense that they totally know me and I've done stuff and I do my stuff through my own work, but Seth is very . . . It's like man. Wow. Anyway. </p> Absolutely. Absolutely.</p> This is why I was interested in this in grad school. I think this is all connected to collective trauma. It's a microscopic thing in the family, but it's really a community-based thing. It really is. It's also the reason why I love Assyrian guys' and girls' weirdness because we can't help it. There's like this weird thing. It's kind of like you're my cousin. I want that validation, you know? I think there are a lot of fucked-up things like that and I really think if I were a psychologist, I think there are incredible studies that either have been done or could be done about—especially this one, because it's not recognized. It's one thing if it's recognized. Then you somehow cobble together a healing process, but I can't imagine what the psychological backlash is generation after generation of, not only not being recognized, but just being toyed with. It becomes a political football. Yeah, what happens in our community also goes on, maybe not in all families, but in a lot of them. [00:13:13]</p> Right. And that the only way to matter is the constant validation from mainstream, non-Assyrian culture. (pause) The very newspaper I was the editor of hasn't written one word about my book. Nothing. Not one thing. The Assyrian section, he's a sweetheart, he had one of my poems translated and published. Yeah, that's awesome. That's a dwindling readership. It's very petty because, God forbid, they give me the attention because I'm the real deal. I'm not some hack. [00:14:27]</p> Because the editor now of that paper is a completely self-serving prick. Completely. This is across the board. Everyone knows this, so he's using the paper to just get his hands into everything. Now he's doing a PhD in genocide studies. He fashions himself this kind of intellectual, cultural, important dude, you know? I think he's my age and he's an ugly little prick and just a dry, boring personality. God forbid that someone else—and he's not from here—someone who is a local boy who, I think, people would be very happy if they . . . that's the other thing. Some of them would be very happy, maybe, to support—they don't even fucking know. I can't reach out to every single—I need a way to get to people. It's not just me. He does that to select—there are certain people he just won't give attention to. (pause) [00:15:47]</p> That's right. That's right. That's right. All you're going to do is kiss the ass of what's above you, right?</p> That's right. That's right. Absolutely. There's no question. There's no question. </p> Yeah. Yeah. So I'm right, right? I'm not an idiot. I know it's literature, but that's my sense. I think I intuited a lot of that, but from what I read as well, yeah, absolutely. I've said that before. It's like a weird combination of inferiority and superiority complex. There's no middle ground. </p> Yeah. Yeah. I've already decided down the road because I know it's going to happen, when they come to me and they want to interview me, I'm going to say no; or if I say yes I'm going to fucking let them have it. Not just them, but all of them. Be like, ""Let me ask you a question. What the fuck are you interviewing me now? I don't need you now. Who the fuck cares for your rinky-dink 3,000 readership or barely that you have? I needed you when I needed you."" [00:17:37] That being said, fuck that. Twitter, everything else, people are so awesome. I love London, I've got to say. Every single person that I've followed, people are like, ""Hey—I love your . . ."" They're so warm. Americans are cool, but British people are just very hardy. They're like, ""Oh, yeah, of course. I love the video."" I do miss that. They're very salt-of-the-earth, even the cool ones. They're just cool people. [00:18:19]</p> It's straightforward. They just appreciate. They're like, ""Ehh. Cool band. I love this."" Boom. They always have that. When I was there, I think I told you, random people that I met egged me on to do an open mike. They let me borrow their guitar. Like what the fuck? Who does that? They're just very, very sweet. I do miss that. (pause) So, yeah, I don't know. I'm even going to send an e-mail to my boss that's fucking loaded. It's weird. I don't want to go there, but that's how important this is. I don't give a shit. That' show important this is. I'm going to be like, ""You've asked me about my music. You've been curious. This is what I'm doing. I just want to share it with you."" She has a little crush on me or something. I don't care. Fine. If that works to help the effort a little bit, I'm down. (pause) [00:19:43] I was like, ""Maybe I should sell my car."" (chuckles) I won't do that, but I was like how to figure out ways, so . . . (pause) One of my academic friends, one of these guys I was saying gets ignored a lot, is the editor of the Assyrian Review, which is one of the only really across-the-board outside of Assyrian, good scholarly journal. It's based here. I decided I'm going to do a grant proposal for them. They're a non-profit, and that way it will give me experience. It will be great for them if I can get them some money. I think that's a good idea. [00:20:52]</p> No. He's one of my best friends. Remember I told you a friend of mine gave me $2,000 to fix my car? He's a sweetheart. No, no, no. I just said if we get some money out of it, if he can give me a little bit, whatever, I'm okay. It's more that I'll just cut my teeth on it.</p> And also it's something I care about. This is what real people do in a community. That's an amazing journal and it deserves to do well; and my friend deserves to do well. (pause) </p> Yeah, and the support he doesn't have. And the amazing thing about him is that he's one of them. He was in the Assyrian political party and he's born in Libya. He's hard core, but he won't kiss their ass so . . . (pause) I guess the long and short of it is that I feel pretty good, I guess, like I'm doing pretty good. [00:22:31]</p> Yeah. I think what it is, is now I have a more realistic—like this is going to get done. I've put my mind to it. If I have to humiliate myself and ask a bunch of people for $500 or whatever it is, that's going to happen. That's just going to happen. I'm not doing this shit all over again; and I shouldn't have to. That's the thing. There's no reason for this not to succeed. I'm not asking for $10,000 or whatever. I'm asking for something reasonable when it's a bunch of people, so this is going to fucking happen. So I think that's making me feel something. There's also that it's empowering. I feel like, you know what, I fucking believe in this and enough is enough. Every dumbass is doing some project and getting somewhere and are you kidding me? Fuck that, man. I think that's empowering, kind of. [00:23:40]</p> Going and getting it. That's it. No, no, no. I'm going and getting it. Absolutely. </p> I'm willing it to happen. Absolutely. Fuck that. (pause) Even in general, I had all these tension headaches. I didn't take Ativan. I was like, ""All right, my head hurts because I'm excited/stressed and I'm working my ass off."" It's hard to sit in front of a computer or on your iPhone 10-12 hours a day. It's dizzying. </p> Yeah. (long pause) [00:25:28]</p> Yeah. And I'm finally allowing what other people are telling me to be true. Everyone is like, ""Dude, the video is awesome. This is great. It's like you're pushing to make your goal."" It's not that I didn't believe that, it was because I was in that position of waiting for others to validate. It's like, yeah, I am going to make my goal. I demand to make my goal because there's no fucking reason not to here. (pause) This is making me plan more, too, a little bit. It's like, ""You know what? This time next year I want to go and play shows in Europe."" Why the fuck wouldn't I do that? What are you crazy? Plane ticket? I don't care. I'll sleep on people's floors. That's what you do. Whatever, because we'll do well there. I don't know if my whole band can do it or not, but it's going to get done. It's a solo project. It's making me finally really take control of how I want things to go instead of just letting things unfold in some random—you know, and then feeling like, ""Why am I not able to . . ."" Well, yeah, you're not able if you don't enact or try to enact your will onto things. If you let things just kind of willy-nilly happen then, of course, it feels like you're weak and ineffectual. (pause) [00:28:20]</p> Yeah, it's incredible. What I feel good about is that I've been working hard. I'm reaping the rewards now of fucking hard work. This is not like some epiphany. I think that's why it feels genuine. It's not like, ""This week I feel like this."" I'm having my ups and downs but, overall, even in those dark moments something is like, ""Okay. Today you feel like . . ."" Even when I was here last week or the week before, there was something when I left here that was like—I can't explain it. Do you know what I'm saying?</p> It wasn't like I wanted to curl up. Even before I came here I was out doing things and it's a very different way to be. You can have those moments. We all have those moments. It doesn't matter how much you better yourself or whatever. Some days you're going to feel defeatist or whatever the fuck you feel, but something in you is like, ""This is just part and parcel of having a week."" just part and parcel of having a week."" [00:30:25]</p> It's not like some random thing is happening to me that's out of my control.</p> That's right. That's right. I know for a fact the way that he did it. I have like 40 backers; he had like 12. So, clearly, he hobnobbed and some people gave big chunks, and that's exactly what I'm going to do if it comes down to that. There are still 15 days, so I'm hoping I might just have $500, hoping I can keep it going. You're totally right. People do all kinds of stuff. It's like starting a business. You do what you have to do. Even the show that we're going to play tonight, it's all very different. I'm not even thinking about it. After here I'm going to go about my day and around 7:00 I'm going to go to the center and play a show. I don't fucking care; whereas before, I would have either totally not have done the show, I would have found an excuse not to do it, or I would be stressing all fucking day worrying about things that are going to go wrong or be all nervous. [00:32:24]</p> Yeah. I just don't give a fuck. If I'm going to go and kick their fucking asses, (chuckles) I don't care. I don't give a shit. I have an awesome band, great songs—fuck it. And also, who cares? It's a little bar in the Square. I'm not playing Wembley Stadium. Even that feels very, very different. (pause) </p> Yeah, no. I mean the only thing riding on it is that it's moving forward. All of these things are steps, you know what I mean, and that's what's important. You have to keep your eye on the prize. (pause) [00:33:31] Even the woman thing, I think I'm turning the corner. The science chick might come to the show tonight and even the yoga girl—if they want to fool around and hang out, that's cool, but that's all I can do. Unless I'm falling in love or genuinely into somebody, I'm kind of tired. I just want to be honest like, ""Look, this is where I am in my life. I just want to be clear. As long as you don't expect anything, as long as we're just hanging out, it's fine."" [00:34:19]</p> Now I can have them around because it's fun. I do like them, but just be clear with them that I'm just not in a place where I can get serious and have expectations. If you're cool with that, cool. If not . . . </p> It's nice, but it's not all about that. (pause) [00:36:07] It is interesting, though, that the one thing that gives me tension headaches is there is that space of feeling like I'm kind of happy, do you know what I mean? I don't like the word, ""happy"". I don't like that word. I know you have moments of happiness, but I don't believe that you can just be a happy person. That kind of annoys me actually, just like you can't be sad every moment. I definitely feel like, ""Wow. I feel so content in a way and I actually feel kind of empowered,"" but it's a big adrenalin rush, so that's making me feel a little like it's causing tension in a way because my body and my mind doesn't know what to do with that. Is that possible? [00:37:07]</p> Is that above thou/below thou?</p> Is that a saying?</p> I'm going to name the next record . . . that's a great phrase. [00:37:44]</p> Above thou/below thou. I'll give you credit. I'll use a pseudonym for you. Wow, that's cool. I'm sorry.</p> Everything has come from the outside which, of course, is no way to be.</p> So now I think it's like my—like you can be with work, right? Send this pretty much like, ""I love what you've written. This is excellent,"" blah, blah, blah. ""Thanks."" So even that's like—wow. That's it? I have this nice job and people are nice and they like what I do. I think my body is almost like what the fuck is happening? (both chuckle) (pause) </p> I think all of it is really about being empowered, that a pill or some chick or your mom or your fucking boss or even a psychologist is not going to waive a wand or something. It's a simple thing, but it's not if you're someone that never had that. </p> That's the thing with these chicks, too. I've done away with that now. Even when I think of Samantha or Michelle, now when I think of them I don't think that anymore. They're humans. Sometimes they sweat, you know what I mean? When I think of the nitty-gritty of what it is to be a human, I'm like, ""Yeah, whatever."" Everyone's got their weird quirks. When you really take time to look closely, everyone's got something that you could be repelled by. Except Cecelia—she's an amazing cat. </p> Okay. 3:10?</p> 3:15 tomorrow. Thanks, then. See you tomorrow.</p>",0

[00:01:00]</p> Oh, okay. Yeah, I feel bad for canceling but it's probably better that I did that cause the train stopped in the afternoon, and I wouldn't have had a way to get back to work, so (laughs) but –</p> Yeah, it wasn't so bad here, I guess. Um, but, it's better to be safe, I guess. (laughs) (pause for .02 seconds) Let's see, I didn't take down notes from last time—I forgot. I should remember but this week's been a little busy for me. So, um, let's see (pause for .02 seconds) so, like, I'd like to talk about a couple of things that were on my mind. [00:02:08]</p> Um, I guess that was just brought home by this: (ph) so I was working, um, I was writing and I was—I just had this idea that David will come back and we will cook dinner together, or something. And I texted him and he's like, ""Oh, yeah, I'm on my way to a faculty dinner. I won't be back until like 8:30,"" and I was like, ""What?"" (laughs) I mean, he didn't know that I was, I had this plan. I didn't communicate that to him.</p> Yeah. I was just like, I mean I see the other side now, but if you give me just two seconds I will be right back in that zone feeling really hurt and mad and betrayed and left and abandoned. (laughs) I don't know why—I just felt so anxious. And so lonely, and like, ""Why can't I have this just one thing? You know, people probably do this every other night, or whenever they want to. Why don't I have that? Why can't I inspire—(pause for .02 seconds) I don't know—like friendship in people?"" [00:08:04]</p> Yeah, I was living with my dad's mom and father.</p> I don't know. They just sent me there. They were like, ""Oh, you need –"" I don't know. I'll have to ask my mom if there was something going on between them. Those were tense years—well, you know, all of my childhood was, you could say. (laughs) It was all crappy because of my dad. But, um (pause for .02 seconds) he, um (pause for .02 seconds) I guess they told me at the time that I needed exposure to other members of the family, which is probably true cause I was either with my mom or—when my dad came back—with my mom and dad. [00:10:58]</p> The marriage, yeah. </p> I don't know, yeah.</p> Yeah, no, there is not a connection.</p> But still she shouldn't have—she did say that, ""Yes. I was not a virgin before marrying,"" but she didn't say—cause that must have happened several months ago. Anyways, so they chucked her out and so—or she just leaves of her own accord. This is ridiculous and this is not just like: hey, you don't cook well, or you put too much salt, or this thing wasn't done well. This is like huge. So she just leaves. [00:14:26]</p> He was a scientist. He was—that was the only time of his life (laughs) that he actually made any money, and you know, (whispers) wasn't over here goofing off. (ph)</p> As to why –</p> Yeah.</p> Well, my parents were going through (coughs) you know, ridiculous things. My dad had married again (laughs) so when he came back and everyone was gone, his mom got him married. And that one turned out to be—his second wife turned out to be really awful. </p> Um hmm (laughs) well, only if you give good words to Islam. (ph)</p> Yeah, no. It was illegal. [00:17:59]</p> Yeah. And my mom now thinks that the reason he came back was just so she could save him from—like so she could divorce him or something, cause the second wife was like, ""I'm going to take you to court. This is illegal. I'm your second wife,"" and, ""This is not allowed.""</p> I have no idea. (laughs) I have no idea. I don't know. (pause for .05 seconds) That's was completely sub-conscious. I wasn't really consciously connecting the dots or anything. Just (sighs) why do you think –</p> No, I didn't. (pause for .33 seconds) Yeah, I mean I understand where, what they were going through but that doesn't mean that I don't—I'm not resentful if—you know—if I feel like cheated out of a nice time (laughs). (pause for .09 seconds) It's like I'm trying not—I don't know. (pause for .18 seconds) </p> I don't want to get too—I'm not sure. Sometimes I don't know if I don't want to get to that point. But I think maybe if I'm slightly happier I'd say, yeah maybe it's best not to get to that point. [00:24:05]</p> It's supposed to (laughs) but no, you know, we always compare ourselves to those who have more. (laughs) (pause for .47 seconds) Sometimes I think that I just have not forgiven my parents for all that mess. I don't know if I ever will or if I ever will want to forgive them. (pause for .09 seconds)</p> (laughs) Yeah.</p> No, no. I was thinking about it—I didn't spend too much time thinking about it, but I feel I know what you're trying to get me to understand is that I should, again, have my own standards. I should be generous enough to myself that (pause for .02 seconds) I don't have to constantly question if my behavior is normal or not. What's right for me is right for me, you know? I don't know—maybe that's what you're trying—</p> (laughs)</p> What's your –</p> Well, I see that as me yet again leaning (laughs) on other people, and not –just not having that backbone, that pillar, within myself. So, then I feel like. ""Oh, this is way too much."" I feel like a baby when I say this but I'm being asked to do everything on my own here. (laughs) </p> (laughs) </p> I feel like a baby though.</p> I want to be coddled and loved and (laughs) just taken around and like tossed in the air and then get caught in strong arms, and so (laughs) pathetic.</p> (laughs) It does sound way too nice. </p> Well you have to hit the ground and then you have to scrape your knee, and you have to go through that developmental (pause for .02 seconds) process, you know: where you become a toddler and break your teeth, and you break your knee, and then, la la la. Here you are—now, an adult. (laughs) (pause for .20 seconds)</p> My childhood.</p> Yeah. (pause for .06 seconds)</p> It's funny. I feel (pause for .04 seconds) I used to feel a lot of pride at having (pause .02 seconds) withstood stuff like that—I don't know if that's the right word or if I'm being accurate. But, you know, when I was standing by the window in Bombay I felt (pause for .02 seconds)—I mean, every time I've thought about that moment, that I felt strong and proud that my grandma wasn't coddling me like I hear a lot of my friend's grandmas doing. [00:32:14]</p> I have no idea. I mean, this sounds so maudlin like—ah! (laughs) But (pause for .02 seconds) I don't know. What do you think being happy means?</p> Yeah. For me, though—would you know? [00:36:00]</p> Yeah. (laughs) Right, cause I don't know. (pause for .10 seconds)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Yeah, you're right. (laughs) Um, I would say, yeah—all—yeah you said much more than I could've been able to articulate right now, but I would definitely say engaged. That is like a keen measure for me: if I'm not paying attention; if I'm not, like, attentive, like, um, withdrawn—that for me is bad. That to me is like, I'm not—I'm sad. My goal is to be engaged and like curious and having a few cylinders firing at the same time, you know? [00:37:59]</p> Yeah. (pause for .13 seconds) Yeah, but (pause for .02 seconds) I feel like David is all and all cerebral in a sense that he has ideas. I mean, he's content and he's happy and he's probably feeling it, but his expressing of it is not as loud or vocal or you know, motorized (laughs) as mine might be. [00:40:07]</p> (whispers) I'll have to think about that. (pause for .05 seconds) Is that—that's not—is that significant do you think, or—?</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I mean, it's new to me and I'm so close to it so I can't judge it properly. But if feels new, you know? And this feeling again of the moment that, until now I interpreted as me feeling strong and coming of age or whatever, felt—now I feel is sad, and devoid of that power that I initially inscribed to it. That feels new. [00:43:57]</p> Yeah, maybe. (pause for .04 seconds) Or, or—and here's the crazy part (laughs)—maybe I don't feel power because I see myself failing and falling. I've survived until now, but you know, I still feel very dubious about whether this was a survival or not, you know? Being sad so much, having been sad so much, I feel like, ""This is not survival, you know? What the hell?"" you know? (laughs) [00:44:57]</p> Yeah.</p> Um, Friday—should I just look at the e-mail?</p> Hmm.</p> Okay, sure.</p> Let me do that.</p> Okay. Yeah, I mean, I have the letter but it doesn't make sense.</p> Okay.</p> Thank you.</p>",2
1000094419.txt,"I....there...during our orientation for the law school. They passed out information about the clinic. </p> Well, I had a therapist in....when I was living in Boston and so I....it was....you know....feeling okay at that point, but I figured it would be a good thing to keep track of. (inaudible) just in case. </p> Well, when (inaudible) thing, I think it was probably about two years. But initially, you know, on a weekly basis for maybe three to six months and then after that, it was every couple of weeks; every other month; you know, it was more regular as needed basis. </p> I, you know, I was in a better place and was making the transition to move here and so I just wasn't seeing....I mean...it was just it faded away. </p> No, no, no. I'm sorry. I kept track of the phone number that we were passed out.... 0:01:31.3</p> Yeah, they handed us a pamphlet. I said, okay, I will keep this and I stuck it in a little folder. </p> ....come back. Yeah, pull it out. Well, I...as I went through....I did my first semester of law school over the summer and you know, getting into that and moving here seems to exacerbate a lot of anxiety kinds of issues that I had in the past and that particularly came to a head a couple of weeks before finals. I was in a relationship that ended kind of right around there too. And when I called here and found out that you guys didn't have any space, they sent me over to the (inaudible) and Psychological Services. So I went in there. I was really wanting to make sure that I had a relationship with somebody going into finals. That really freaked me out....to not have anybody handy so, I got in with them and I saw a social worker over there, I think three times or something like that and I just saw her the last week and I met with their psychiatrist....this therapist had suggested that she thought that maybe (inaudible) doing some kind of medication would be helpful so she got me in to see their psychiatrist, who I saw last week and she recommended....well, sort of.....she....we decided to do Fluoxetine Prozac. So I started that last Thursday. 0:03:01.5</p> No, they're the same medicine. </p> They're only short term.</p> So the therapist there had said that she'd be okay seeing me for, you know, six or eight sessions or something like that but you guys called and I wanted to get something long term. </p> And I got started on the medication and I got the impression...you know, I don't know....it was...I think it was maybe the shortness of the duration of how often...you know I only saw him three times. The first time I came in, you know, 20 minutes into the session she was saying she thought I needed medicine. I'd never done that before. I'd never done medication before. (inaudible) reservations about it. </p> So, we spent a big portion of that first session talking about that; got the appointment with the psychiatrist set up; spent the next session talking about some more like (inaudible) behavioral kinds of things, which I thought was a fairly good session and then the last session....so it was just three...was after I'd seen a psychiatrist. I was again having some reservations about the medication so we spent the whole time doing the medication....you know, talking about the medication there. And I don't know if it was...I don't know if I'm projecting my anxieties about taking medicine but I kind of felt like I was getting a big push from them. 0:04:29.7</p> To take stuff and that's fine. I think I probably needed it and I think it was an okay choice to do it but it was just sort of a funny conclusion because we had.....you know initially she had been all about the medication and then I expressed these reservations and she said well, we can do this kind of (inaudible) real stuff. You know, see you for six or eight sessions; see how things go. I said well, I'd be delighted to see the psychiatrist; let's do that too. so I don't know if we miscommunicated that once I was on the medicine then she didn't think I needed to see her anymore or....I don't' know. it was just sort of a (inaudible) whatever but regardless, I wanted something long term so it felt like I needed to explore that. </p> Well, no...the long term (inaudible) that I want to make sure that I have a relationship with somebody or with a place for a period of time because I'm going to be here for three years and my stuff has been going on for some time. What...it's interesting. I think over the last couple of weeks, having seen these folks over there and then you know, being so explicit about medicine, I've been sort of looking at things a little bit differently. The practitioners that I've seen in the past, I have chosen specifically because they had a philosophy that didn't go into doing medication. </p> Exactly. So I've never explored that before. I had never explored this really even, I don't think, within a like pathology construct per se. And so it....you know, looking at it that way, it sort of gave me a different vision on things. When I addressed it previously in Boston, it was more of a...maybe on a situational basis...on a...very much like a dynamic, like, how are we approaching this thing; what's it mean; what's it coming from; how do you approach it? And so I think that I have had periods of time, you know, maybe it's (inaudible) and maybe it's the mix of things where I....and I think what ends up happening is I get fairly...I think the main thing that happens is I get really judgmental or uptight or down on myself or you know, those kinds of things. Mandy over at Caps (ph) finally said...she said you just don't like yourself and I don't think that that's...that's not all the time. I think what happens is I have periods of that. </p> It's definitely...yeah. I mean it's definitely adjustment phased, I think. But so....yeah. I think that might be the main thing. I mean, you know, relationships ending, moving; those two things together is really bad. Those are the main ones and then sort of....then also I've had a couple of....I used to practice at (inaudible) of Life and the...there was a....what got me into therapy finally (inaudible) Boston is I [was dating a guy and fell through] (ph) (inaudible) for that, so that was another big time. So those kinds of ...I mean I don't know that it's specifically situational. I don't know that I could...like I know that at those times it was happening. I trusted it was happening at other times too but it's just hard to pin it down. </p> That was...it was three or four years ago and this has been going on since I was very small, I think. </p> Yeah. I can just think of....I'm just thinking of them now is sort of bad times when I know I wasn't okay. I wasn't feeling alright...yeah; you know, sort of bad years; bad periods. I guess. 0:08:21.8</p> No. I think the first one was probably sixth grade which was the onset of middle school. You know, feeling really alienated. I mean I don't...I think I'm spending...I may be spending too much time thinking about this too. I don't know how much of this is just over reaction stuff but.....</p> Yeah, exactly. Right. So, tenth grade I think was pretty bad too. Freshman year...I was here for undergrad...freshman year was bad. And then the rest of college I think was pretty much okay. Although this summer....there was one summer that was pretty bad. </p> And then my first year out of undergrad was probably okay and then my second year out of undergrad was that I had....I moved to Charleston and that was probably...I mean next to this last, you know, this last month or so, that's probably the worst it's been. </p> And that's sort of recent memory. You know, I was crying every day...going...driving home from work and that kind of stuff. I don't ever get dysfunctional. Like I can always work. I can always carry on. </p> Just this stress and the relationship ending and finals and everything else. </p> The 25th I was done so like the 22nd and 24th, I think...they were that weekend there. </p> Yeah, essentially...like a week, two weeks before that there was a big thing and then just the time leading up to finals. </p> Well, I was getting sort of chest tightness in class. I was crying every day. I was getting....having a lot of fairly irrational thoughts.</p> Oh, like, you know, the (inaudible) everybody's smarter than I am; I can't do this; I'm going to fail; that kind of thing. The relationship....the thing....what precipitated that, I mean and this is sort of going into the irrational...the irrational thought pattern stuff was starting almost as soon as I started here. My girlfriend was hearing that kind of stuff and that was hard for her to deal with. She wasn't dealing with it particularly well. She had been and this was sort of a funny relationship anyway.....she'd been in Thailand for like five and a half months which is almost the entire duration of the relationship. It started right before she left and then she was gone and then she came back. </p> And so she came back. She was in Boston but was here for a couple of weeks or whatever and so....coming back I think was bound to precipitate some problems too. 0:11:45.7</p> No, I mean it was great. It was wonderful. We had...we were talking over the IM; we were talking over Skype; we were on the phone; it was actually really good. It was nice and then her coming back was really good at first and then we just started seeing (ph) each other. So there was this...we had this like big thing where she was expressing something that she needed within the relationship and my reaction to that was that I couldn't provide what it was that she needed. And I just had this big melt down...that this is sort of evidence that I could never be in a relationship and you know, was never capable of loving anybody; nobody's ever capable of loving me; and that was it and the world was awful and everything's going to end. You know, it was just this big thing. And that was sort of...that was the big moment and then that kind of kept happening over the next couple of weeks. The idea of this relationship ending was like this horrible and awful thing, which is pretty much how I react to all of relationships ending and I haven't really ever had a relationship that lasted all that long and so.....</p> I dated this guy once for a year in like my freshman year of college. Julie was like six months but you know, she was gone for most of it so....</p> Yeah. 0:13:14.7</p> No, this is a totally new one. Yeah. No. I don't....the thing that happens...I mean the relationship...the pattern in the relationship is that I tend to find people who are unavailable one way or the other. Either they don't want to be in a relationship...they're in Thailand or, you know, somebody who's already in a relationship, you know, any of these kinds of things. And then.....or I'm not really all that interested in them; whatever. There's always this little something that's just not quite right. And then I tend to fall for people...I'm really hesitant at first; I find everything that's wrong with them; and then once I decide that I'm going to do it, I like....it's absolute, complete, without (inaudible) will end. And then I get...I think I get probably fairly clingy fairly quickly and then something comes up that they don't.........they can't be in the relationship...it always feels like it comes up very suddenly and out of the blue and then that's it and it's done and it's over. So that's sort of the relationship thing. I think that was probably the other reason that this relationship was frustrating was because I sort of possibly (ph) got all of that stuff and it still happened so..... </p> (overlapping voices) I'd rather not be crying everyday but that's not happening anymore. </p> I've had five good days in a row. </p> Well, I haven't talked....we haven't...she and I haven't been talking as much and we've touched base on the phone a couple of times. I've been sleeping; it's anew semester; it's easier; I've been exercising. And I think, you know, some of it has faded. I've been taking that Prozac. I can't imagine that within, you know, however many days it's made a difference but I suspect that there's a little bit of a placebo effect, like I know I have it there. So, yeah. </p> Yeah, I have a really....I have a very supportive group of friends. My...there's six girls...five others that we've been friends since high school. My closest...one of....my closest friend within that group, she and I have been, you know, bosom buddies since we were twelve. </p> Yeah. (laughs) We're really close and then...</p> That's Sarah. And then I have another friend, a male, Joshua; he and I have been...I mean the same thing since freshman year in college....my freshman year in college. 0:16:31.3</p> No. They're both in Boston. And the...well, there...I....a couple...three of the girls from my school are here in New York but they're in Ithaca. (inaudible) So I haven't seen them much and it sort of divvied up. There were three of us that went to Boston and three of us that stayed home and so....we're all still...you know, we went away for a girls weekend in July or whatever and all got together but they're...the three that are home are all married and have babies. And the three of us that have been in Boston have been sort of young and single and doing the...that world so I'm closer to them...I have more in common with them. 0:17:05.7</p> Yeah. I've made friend within the law school. </p> I have a friend who...another friend that I have known since middle school that's here finishing undergrad so he's around too. </p> Yeah...support...yeah. </p> They're here. They're in Ithaca. </p> They...you know, it's...they're...in some ways it's more stressful than not. Not as bad, it's just goofy. Growing up was really a problem (ph). It was fairly chaotic and, you know, fairly chaotic family life. My dad has a really nasty temper and he's very unpredictable. He works a lot. He would come home very crabby. My mom works a lot too. she...we never...I....she wasn't much in the way of mister (ph) protection from his thing and she was little unpredictable herself. I mean understandably they'd start fighting and I think they'd take it out on us a little bit. It's never...there were a couple of incidents in the high school...early high school, like my freshman year or something like that where my dad and I got into this fight kind of things. But that was the extent of any kind of physical stuff. But there were many, many more times than that....I think there was one time in February when I left the house in my slippers and walked to Sarah's house so it's just...it wasn't...the relationship has repaired quite a....well, you know, we don't fight like that anymore. But, yeah...it's still, you know....and I talk to them probably...I mean I talk to my mom a couple of times a week and probably my dad, you know, at least once every two weeks and it's congenial but there's this sort of underlying ick. 0:19:05.8</p> (inaudible) </p> Sure, it throws you off when you got a different time zone. Yeah, I hear you. (laughing) </p> Sure.</p> It's just tightness. </p> It's like I can't get a full breath is what happens. </p> It happened, you know, four or five times the week before finals. It hasn't happened since then. 0:19:59.0</p> Well, the entire month that all this was happening, I had really like nasty intestinal upset. But that has straightened back out again too. </p> Oh, no. I mean I have maybe three times. This was one of them where it went through my head that I could see why somebody would want to do that. I never made a plan. Like the thought is terrifying to me. If anything else, any time that comes it gets me back (inaudible) that's just so creepy and weird. But I definitely have...it just...it makes sense because it feels so awful. </p> I think it was probably before finals. I don't think it happened afterwards. </p> No. No, no, no...nothing, nothing like that. </p> I really don't think that....I just....I can't even fathom doing it. </p> Yeah, like I said, I mean that same exact like fleeting....I can get a ....it happened, you know, five years ago. </p> It was actually...I was...this Julie and I had sort of...she was getting out of a relationship; I had just come out; we were sort of toying with the idea of something happening and just it just got really weird and bizarre and it was sort of right after that. It was about four months after I had moved to Boston. 0:22:12.3</p> No (ph). </p> No. </p> (inaudible) </p> My mom's father was an alcoholic. </p> No. I don't think so. Julie and I would have this debate on occasion. A...if I go out and I start drinking, if I have more than two like glasses of wine or something like that, I don't have any tolerance and if I have a third, I will be drunk. And so since I've been in school I don't think I've even done that once so....five or six times...five or six months, excuse me. 0:23:10.2 </p> That's fine. I can't remember anything (overlapping voices) </p> Well, this is a...this is what Mandy and I got into at Caps (ph)...we were talking about like my dad's temper and her and with the alcoholism....like my mom's family...like all my...they're all really heavy drinkers. And so we were talking about whether that was just sort of a self medication kind of thing. I think my dad's stuff probably is something...anxiety, depression...my big sister, my older sister, has been on Wellbutrin (ph) for the last six months for ADD and depression. </p> No, no, no. She's in Manhattan, New York. They both are. I have two sisters. </p> Both older. </p> Yeah.</p> No. I mean I don't know what....Doctor...I saw Kathleen King...Dr. King over at the...at Caps (ph). I don't know what she eventually was calling it. We talked anxiety; we talked depression; we talked adjustment disorder; I don't know what she came up. </p> No. </p> I don't know. I mean I think that....I think there's....I know that a big piece of this is, you know, sort of coming up....you know, growing up in this, you know, my family and whatever and I....I guess what I'm looking for is to kind of....I think what keeps happening is I and maybe this is sort of a normal part of the process but I think I, you know, get to a point where I have some sort of a...either a realization...it's either good or maybe not so good and then you sort of fall back from the process a little bit. And I just...I'd like to get to a place where...I know that ups and downs are normal, I think I just swing a little bit down probably more than most folks do and I think that that's getting worse the older I get and that's frightening to me. I don't want to keep feeling like this. And so I think what I'd like to do is sort of figure out a way to mitigate that or to prevent that from happening; figure out a way....I need to...one of the big things that was going on with (inaudible) and I was her thought was that I was kind of disconnected, you know, sort of between what I was feeling and being able to talk about that. I know that that's an issue. I wonder, you know, out of the bulk of that whole thing if maybe that was more relationship specific. I don't know but this relationship thing makes me crazy and I don't...you know, since (inaudible) is that your sort of I am where I am, you know, I'm 28 and I have made a lot of good progress, I think, in terms of understanding myself and yet here I am...you know, sort of still in this place where I can't seem to maintain an intimate relationship and that's frustrating also. </p> Something that's sort of mutually fulfilling and committed and sustaining. I'd like to have children. I don't want to do that in the context of something that is, you know, casual or like (inaudible) 0:28:08.5</p> Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. </p> Well, I just figure it the way I approach, you know, my life and my relationships, you know, is all based in that. I know I get...you know, as much as there are a lot of different things that can sort of set me into this place where I'm feeling really hateful about everything, I joke around....I tell my...you know, when I'm talking to friends, it's like I sort of feel like the worlds a horrible place and I am horrible in it. I do the same the in relationship where I take a relationship and I just pick it apart. You know? These are all the things that are...sometimes, not always. I wasn't doing this with Julie. It's either one thing...either one thing is happening where I'm just picking apart; it's so not right; you know, any number of reasons or I'm...or I miss it altogether; like just something's just not...it's just not clicking, I guess. I don't know if I'm making much sense. I'm not making much sense to myself right now but....</p> Right.</p>",2

And -besides mathematicians, and he was just like, you know—it was interesting, because before I came, he had sort of moved on from chaos -</p> —which he had published so many works back in the days, and he had kind of done what was more fundable, what would get him money. But now I was the first one that I guess I brought chaos back into his life (laughs). And you know, now all the other new Ph. D students that are a year below me and a year below that, they're all doing works on chaos. And I don't know, I just thought it was -</p> —you know, I mean it's -</p> Yeah, I did. And I mean that (laughs)—you know, and he actually said—he's like, ""Well, I'm really going to miss you once you leave next year."" And I was like, ""Leave next year? He still thinks I'm going to leave next year? Maybe I am going to leave next year."" </p> Because I—my research, it's kind of hard to balance out everything and you know, sometimes when I have homework or stupid presentations for the class to work on, like I sort of shift my focus, and it's hard to like really, you know, just concentrate on my research.</p> But it was good to sort of get that interest back and it's—it's interesting, because now that I sort of like—I sort of realized that if I fall asleep, it's generally just because I'm tired or, you know, (coughs) it's not like anything's wrong with me. So I can actually stay awake more during reading papers like -</p> —like, I'll just like—</p> —I'll just take more breaks or like—and I'm actually doing a lot more work at home, like I'll split up the day. Like in the morning, after Jeremy leaves, I'll work for like an hour, take like an hour nap, and then I'll be up and working again and I won't take another nap. And then I'll usually go into school, which is why I was taking the bus in to get to you, because you were my midday split. </p> And so—yeah, it's actually—by breaking up the day like that, I just realized I can't sit by myself in an office all day. I mean, I need different variety.</p> And I like -</p> Yes (laughs).</p> Yeah, yeah, it was. And I mean, I realized that I do need—like last night I was just so happy about, you know, graduating in a year, I just couldn't get to sleep until like 4:00 A.M. I was just so happy.</p> Yeah (laughs). I mean, normally, I don't do that, but—but today, I'm tired. I took a nap, so I guess that equaled five hours of sleep, kind of. That's not bad. But -</p> No, I know. I know. I'm planning on going to bed early, but I mean, it's just—it was interesting like because like I didn't realize how stressed out I was getting by the whole presentation and my Ph. D., and like I was breaking out—I—like all over my body. And I -</p> —I mean, not serious, but normally, I don't break out say on my arms or -</p> —and you know, it's crazy because I just sort of—I sort of realized that anxiety is like something—it's really internal and like it really—I mean, even though I don't worry about stupid stuff -</p> —the anxiety is, you know—like I really see that it's good that I'm trying to learn how to manage it because it's—you know, it really affects my body -</p> —and it probably would affect most people's bodies. [00:06:32]</p> Well, as I was preparing the presentation, like every—anything that I put up on the slide, like, well, ""Do I really know this? And is that—let me go back to what this paper says."" And like, ""Oh, this paper says something, I don't really understand this."" And then you have to read other papers.</p> And then I would read other papers and then I'd just like, ""Ugh,"" and then I'd go back and—to see that point -</p> —and I was like—I would be like—you know, I would just keep on—every point was like a—it was kind of like re—setting something in stone. And like it—it—it was—it seemed like if it was going to go up there, it had to be -</p> —I had to try and disprove and improve because it was—it—it was like every—I mean, it was—you know, it's—it's—it's just—you know, giving a presentation, I guess in front of scholars and intellectuals, they're going to ask you questions, questions that you don't even know how to answer. And like, you know, you don't like—at least in our group meetings, like my advisor like when you're wrong, he'll say, ""Oh, well, you're being misleading. And I don't really like this slide, you know, because people are now confused. Let me tell you how it really is."" [00:07:57]</p> So in a sense, he does correct -</p> —he doesn't just call—call you out and say it's wrong, because you know the group legitimately was conflict—confused -</p> —on one slide. But I guess the week before there was another sort of visiting student. He gave his presentation and it was just very painful -</p> —because Edward would say like, ""Well, well, I don't know. Like, you're doing this wrong."" </p> Or like, you know, ""I don't understand. This—this—this doesn't make sense."" And like he would say that over and over and over.</p> And like people were getting restless and like—and like the guy went up to the board and he wrote stuff and it didn't make sense. </p> You know, and people were—it was just like I sort of—I guess everyone—like I didn't want to be like that, and I remembered -</p> —how my last presentation in the class went, which was not to the group, but to the actual quantum information class. And you know there—it—it wasn't as flawless, and I realized in hindsight what I should have done is taken notes while we were talking to the TF so that I could have captured -</p> —what is really the physical meaning and—because you know, when you're—you just can forget something when it's not very personal to your heart. [00:09:22]</p> And—and—but the quantum information class that I'm taking is kind of like a—like I want—like I really tried and wanted to like it, but it was—it's definitely not an introductory course. Like, I mean, I don't know—maybe I was—maybe I was stupid for thinking it was going to be—I don't know what I was thinking it would be. But I thought it -</p> —like I know what an introductory physics course is, but this is a graduate course. But still, introductory means that—like I mean, just the—the things he talks about and maybe like people—more—the people that are taking this class are more specialists, like people that have been in his research group, the professor's -</p> —research group for like two years are taking this class. And I was like I knew nothing about quantum information, and like the lectures I don't really get much from, and like while I could prepare (coughs) for each lecture, it just sort of seems that—like there's so much reading to go—because he moves so fast. [00:10:32]</p> And there's like—it was kind of like no way—I mean, I learned probably more from reading for the homework than—I mean, I go to his lectures -</p> —but I didn't go to his extra lecture that was on Friday because I was too tired.</p> But I don't know, I just get frustrated because it's kind of like you're—I mean, there is sort of a culture in some of—you know, in this place, to go out and impress your professor. </p> Like people aren't out to just—I mean, you share knowledge, but they're also there to look smart -</p> —or get the professor's attention and ask a good question.</p> And I don't know. Like I would just like to know what was going on (laughs). And like I mean, you know, the sort of—yeah, I mean, it's just—it's really interesting and it moves really fast paced. And it reminds me of like when I was interested in pursuing—another professor, when I first got to graduate school, and he's actually friends with this professor that I have now. They're like—</p> —they team up. But the one professor is an experimentalist and the other is a theorist. And I was originally taking the theorist's class many years ago. And you know, it was just sort of like—it was such a scary sort of thing. And like, you know, like half the time I just didn't know—I don't know—like I guess for graduate courses, you do have to do a lot of work. [00:12:05]</p> And since I'm not getting tested on the lectures, there's sort—you know, the homework, but a lot of the times, I just do lots of reading on my own for the homework. I guess, maybe that's what he realizes is sort of going to happen. He just feels that he should, you know, just sort of give a good overview. </p> That's why his notes are online, so it doesn't (laughs) I don't know, I guess—I feel kind of—I feel kind of guilty, but then I realize that I'd rather get my life in order, like order more contacts and -</p> —(laughs) and get some sleep, and clean up a little bit, because, I don't know. I guess it's making sort of choices and I'm sort of starting to see like—you know, I'm starting to talk more with my friends and Jeremy about politics and it's actually interesting, because I'm sort of starting to see that maybe now I'm not sort of siding with what my parents say. [00:13:02]</p> Maybe I'm trying to think about it. And you know, it actually—it feels kind of nice to just sort of think about what is important to me -</p> —like what—and—and you know, even though it sounds like, you know, stupid that I skipped lecture, I made the conscious sort of decision -</p> —based upon I was very exhausted, I'm kind of recovering over a cold, and I needed to get my life back together. </p> And I would not gain so much by going in at 12:00. </p> Especially because I'm going to be—I'm working late tonight. I have—I volunteered for a physics—it's, they do free textbooks for education.</p> Like free physics textbooks, so they're like having all volunteers come that are in the physics community—</p> —like from school, to help arrange like—create a book. And so I thought that would be really good to meet -</p> —like possibly other teachers in the area and talk—and you know, so I thought, you know, so I thought—that I thought I only have so much juice for the night in terms of like what I can actually accomplish. And you know, if I go in early, I'm just going to be exhausted by the time I get to this -</p> —networking thing. But I realized, you know, that because I was kind of slower getting—starting on my homework—I was like, I'm not going to go to the fabric store. I really—I just need one sort of thing, and that's the one thing. When I get going on something, I don't want to stop it. And I'm like, ""Well, I should really be doing my homework rather than having to do it during the weekend""—I mean, where I'm actually going for this, the physics textbook thing, it's actually near Downtown, where there is a fabric store. But I just sort of realized that, you know, that shouldn't be my primary focus -</p> —today, because I can just get it online, and sew the table runner before Thanksgiving.</p> It doesn't—you know, it doesn't need -</p> Yeah, it's -</p> Yeah, and that's actually—I mean, that's something like I'm sort of starting to realize like—and all this week, I didn't go to ballet because I—you know, I realized it well—at first, there was the presentation. And then when Jeremy got back and after the presentation, like, you know, I want to spend time with Jeremy since he was gone and -</p> —and I've just been so focused on my presentation and I want to spend time with him.</p> And it was just really nice because we were just laughing and like then I started sewing while he was watching ""The Daily Show"" and you know, it was just really nice to spend time. And it's just—I guess I'm starting to see that, you know, I can have it all, but maybe I'm just going to have prioritize based upon how I'm feeling. </p> Like it doesn't -</p> Yeah (laughs). And I was just getting—because I was—yeah, I was talking to my mom last night because she—she actually—she's—I think she's—I mean, of course she's very upset that my sister is not talking to her, and so you know, we sort of thought that Thursday is our date night with -</p> —when I had talked to my mom and that normally is after Jeremy goes to bed. And so I wound up talking to her until like 1:30 just because my sister also really wanted to talk to me. And I was really wanting to talk to my family because like and—you know, I did something good -</p> —I was feeling hopeful about the future. I was talking to my mom and she's like, ""No wonder you're tired, you're trying to do all these things. You have all these sewing projects."" She's like—and I just realized—it was like, ""Yeah, I do actually have a lot going on."" And -</p> —and it's—you know, it's good that Jeremy actually helps me manage because she was—it was really like the first time—because we were talking about, you know, how she—she's—like my mom was like, ""Well, you know, you're sounding a lot like me."" You know, just being really busy and on your feet, and getting so much done and accomplished. And I was like, ""Well, I guess I am."" I mean, it doesn't seem like it because it's never like a focus sort of thing. I mean, like—I mean, because there's other priorities that come up. Like if I had nothing to do, I'd just be like sewing all day -</p> —and maybe cooking and baking. But now that I sort of see that, ""Ok, well I have—I have work, I mean I can't just be a stay—stay at home blob right now (laughs)."" And so there's—you know, I—I sort of realized—I'm starting to realize how to sort of manage these things and not feel burned out. [00:18:03]</p> And sort of know like—and also actually with my eating, too, I've been figuring that out, too, because for a long time I've been working on this. Like I just sort of gorge when I see a dessert or like—you know, and then like I feel—I just -</p> Eating until my stomach hurts and I feel like I'm going to throw up. </p> And I do that at parties because it was there -</p> —and I don't know. Because it used to be I didn't go to parties very often, so if there was a party then, you know, ""Whohoo, something to celebrate."" But if you're going out like once a weekend, and, you know, going out to like restaurants a lot -</p> —like you can't do that because they give you obviously more food than what you can eat, because that's what people like. And I am starting—or like, for instance, when we have Women of Physics events and it's catered by Flower Bakery, like there's cookies and yeah, I take a little sliver of cake. And maybe just not have dessert later that night. [00:19:07]</p> And that's what I did last night. You know, because I ate at least of spoonful of straight frosting on—on top of a little sliver of cake.</p> And I was like, ""You know, I'm full. I don't really need a dessert. Maybe I'll have a little bite of your ice cream, Jeremy, but I don't need a dessert right now. I'm not feeling""—</p> —you know, and it was kind of interesting, because I was like, you know, I guess I'm starting to learn like when I'm like hungry, when I'm not. And before it was just sort of like I just ate all the time because I didn't know there was like -</p> —I mean, I don't know. I guess and also—like, you know, Jeremy was making lunches that were too big and it always made me really hungry and like so now I'm just sort of eating smaller lunches and maybe -</p> —you know, I don't ever feel like oddly full but hungry very soon. </p> Because I guess he has like he would pack—he would do these like really big salads, and like my stomach would feel big -</p> —not like physically big, but it was just feel like there's lots of stuff and fiber and I guess I don't like that feeling in the middle of the day. I like that at the end of the night. [00:20:27]</p> I mean, I guess it's sort of a preference. He likes bigger lunches, I like bigger dinners. And so I guess switching back to more what I prefer, I'm starting to get back into the feel of what -</p> —you know, what is the right amount, based upon how hungry I'm feeling.</p> And it—it's just interesting, because I—for the first—I don't know how this is happening, why I'm starting to make like decisions. Like I don't know why—you know, and -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, and -</p> Yeah, and if I—I—it seems like I'm a lot more productive like when I like actually want to do something. I mean -</p> Yeah (laughs). </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And I mean, there's sometimes, like instead of going to review sessions, because I mean, maybe it's—yeah, maybe it's going to sort of help out on the homework -</p> —but then I'm going to have to stay a long time, then I'm going to have to, you know, just sit there waiting to ask my specific question and then I sort of -</p> —you know, it sort of makes me anxious sort of just sitting and waiting. And then like sort of—yeah, I'd rather just sort of duke through it myself -</p> —and I think I learn more that way. I mean, maybe I don't. Maybe I just see the trees. But anyway, I'm able to answer the homework, and you know, working with other people is sort of—it's kind of a chaotic experience because like—you know, if everyone's tossing around ideas, and—you know, it's harder for me to think -</p> —when the other people are there. I guess I think slower or maybe I—but anyway, but yeah—I mean, and then I found like I'm just a lot happier if I'm, you know, at home doing the homework like looking at my laptop. [00:22:44]</p> Or like if I'm in my office and—it's just—it's—it's just really interesting. Just—yeah, I guess, I mean—and Jeremy is actually being understanding, too, because like, you know, the fact that he doesn't mind that I work at home. </p> But -</p> Well, you know, maybe he thinks that I'm being a lazy bum or (laughs) not getting out of my jammies -</p> —but, you know, he—he's actually done it once himself, like worked at home and then went later to work. And he's like, ""Hey, I actually—I like this."" He's like, ""It really breaks up the day. I can have lunch where there's kitchen"" -</p> —""and then go, you know, go do""—you know, because he was working from home on his laptop, so -</p> —but—but anyway, I mean—I don't know. I think Jeremy's just very routine oriented and sort of like trying to need to fit in—it's really good that I'm surrounded by routine. And my mom even said that Jeremy was a really good, stable influence on me. [00:23:49]</p> Which is true, he really was. Without him—I mean, that's one thing I realized was that when the hurricane was coming and -</p> —Jeremy was gone, like I was just sleeping odd hours -</p> —and God knows what, not showering, probably eating too much candy (laughs). But you know, I—in a sense it was sort of a good sort of like—I guess I got it out of my system, two days of living like a college student and I realized that, ""Ok, maybe I'll live like a more responsible-to-my -health college student.""</p> But—but yeah, so I—I'm really happy that that's happening and like my mom—it—I was actually—I was really happy that she realized how good Jeremy is for me.</p> Like she's like, ""You know, that boy holds it—holds everything to his word."" She's like, ""You know, I don't know if I""—she's like, ""I don't agree with everything that guy says"" -</p> —""but, you know I know that at least he's going to fulfill what he says.""</p> And then she's like—respectable. </p> And -</p> Yeah. I mean, yeah, it was actually really nice. And so I told Jeremy and Jeremy was like, ""Oh, well, why is she saying this now?"" </p> And so—and Jeremy was like really kind of confused and he was getting kind of irritable, and I was like, ""Oh, you know, my mom is saying how good you are for me."" And I was like well—I told him that—I was like mostly I try and keep my life pretty private because you know -</p> —when you tell people stuff, they can either—if—they'll give you advice and you can either take it or leave it, but family is a little bit more pushy on giving their advice -</p> —you know, and want you to take it, not leave it. Or at least I feel that they're pushy.</p> I mean, my family is pushy and I have a hard time saying no. I think that would be the more correct statement. But—what it is—but—but yeah, so—but I mean, he understood that you know, I—I said that—you know, I was just telling my mom how much, you know—how I'm able to accomplish so much and how Jeremy is such a really good influence on me. And she was just so—you know, so surprised about like what I do -</p> —and like what I do do in life, and I guess it—yeah, it made her really happy. And one thing that made me—I don't know, it kind of—I don't know why it made me mad, but like when Jeremy got back from his conference and he was talking to a lot of the guys in the insurance industries, they're—they're not very—well, I guess they're not very—they're kind of your old sort of skeazy business dudes, you're stereotypical -</p> —they sort of fulfill that and like this one guy—and you know, Jeremy said he seemed like a really nice guy at first, but then he was saying how he—how he like—he was—Jeremy was saying, ""Oh, you know, I have a girlfriend and you know, we're soon to be engaged or we're thinking about getting engaged, you know, within a few years or a year or so."" And he was like—you know, Jeremy was just trying to make conversation and say, ""Oh, do you have any advice?"" And he was like, ""Yeah, don't do it."" He's like, ""I married—before I met my wife, I was churn and burn in college.""</p> Which is really graphic.</p> And then he saying that you know, ""I just—she gave me an ultimatum and you know, it's just kids this and you know, life is so miserable."" And there was another lady who works in the insurance industry who's Jewish, very like kosher Jewish -</p> —which means she's probably pretty orthodox, and she was saying—like Jeremy described—told her that I was a Christian and then she—she was like, ""Oh, well, there's a problem, you should have seen that problem from the very beginning."" And it's like -</p> No, because I celebrate Jewish holidays and I want to bring that to my kids because it's part of his heritage and I love the food.</p> And I love any party. I love any reason to make a cake and justify it. And I -you know, he said he was also raised Christian. He was—his mom put him in like camps like Jews for Jesus, so (laughs) -</p> —and Jeremy says his mom was hedging bets. But you know, he said that if he could raise his children up any religion, it probably would be the Christian one. But you know, just keep the Jewish holidays. And I think the Jewish holidays -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. But you know, I guess I was sort of feeling sort of insecure about whether we were actually going to get married and whether it was just going to continue on, and like whether graduate school—it was like I'm tired of things of getting held off for graduate school -</p> Well, I had talked to my sister earlier that day and she was like well—she was like—because I was talking about, you know, sometimes you just need to do what you need to do. And, you know, mom's not—wasn't happy with my decision, but it was the best thing. And she's like, ""Well, I personally don't agree with it, but you know""—and then she was -</p> —you know, she was being sort of fair about it. She was like, ""Well, if you and Jeremy do eventually do get married""—and I was like, ""What do you mean?"" </p> ""Do eventually like"" -</p> Yeah, like -</p> Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Like—no, no, no. I was like—I mean, I was just sort of well—well there is—you know there is nothing set in stone, I mean, you know?</p> And it is kind of scary in that sense. [00:29:41]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah (laughs). I mean, he could get -</p> Yeah. And he could get even in a car accident and—I think about that. That would be horrible.</p> But yeah, I guess there is a sort of trust and that's sort of like—that's interesting because he said that—you know, he had told my mom like, ""Oh, I could—I don't see the point in getting a promise ring, because that's sort of a material thing that sort of takes away from my word."" </p> You know? Because he gave a promise and I guess -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah, and I guess—I mean, that's one thing that my mom and I were laughing about because I—I said—because I was upset. I really wanted cats and I was tired of just like waiting until I finished my Ph. D. because I was really wondering or upset because I didn't think about—that's going to happen anytime soon.</p> It wasn't going to happen—apparently—I mean, my advisor thinks I'm going to graduate in a year, so I have more hope.</p> And just sort of a refound enthusiasm, but it—yeah, I was just like tired, like why do we have to put on a—put off engagement, put off cats, and put off everything and like put off getting decent sleep. And Jeremy was just like, ""You know""—he's like, ""I believe in you. You've just got to keep on working.""</p> And he's like (laughs)—he's like, ""You've just got to keep on keeping on."" (laughs) Which is kind of a joke because I think it's a cute thing and I don't—I think it's that's a cute sort of thing -</p> —to say and I think at the time when Obama had said it—it's a Bob Dylan line, but Jeremy keeps on like—I mean, I like the line. I thought it was kind of cute. And I was like I—if I told my parents—if I ever said that I think I'd be like not allowed in the house for a day or something, or like (coughs) set to watch Fox News all day or all night. </p> Until I was—but I think it's a cute saying. ""Keep on keeping on."" And you know -</p> —and you know, that's sort of like when I was like, ""Ok."" But I guess—he was like, you know—like my dad always says, you have to finish one stage of life before you get to the next. And you know Jeremy is right about that, because I realized, ""Oh, well, if I'm going to graduate, you know I—I don't have time to focus on cats."" </p> Because, you know, they do occupy your space and mind. [00:32:18]</p> And if they're destroying your furniture and being cute and adorable. And I sort of realized that is something that, yeah, I just have to wait for. It's something that is out there, but, you know, just because it's there doesn't mean I need to buy it or -</p> —you know—and I guess that sort of—I guess I'm starting to learn slowly what control is.</p> It's hard. It's really hard for me. And the other day I went into this CVS, I was really tired. I don't know, I wanted to buy something. I just waste—I—I'm frivolous purchaser. I was like, ""Oh, is there some nail polish?"" And I was like, ""No, I'm just going to grab a water and go home."" And I was like, ""Wait, I do need something."" And then I grabbed—oh, it was like razor blades. </p> I haven't bought those in a year (laughs). And it was like I really do need those. </p> And so -</p> (laughs) I don't know. It's kind of like a—I mean, it's just this sort of like I've had a long day and—there's just sort of—kind of like a happy moment when I buy something. [00:33:30]</p> Yes, a reward. And I think after -</p> —and I think I realized that, you know, there are rewards -</p> —but you just can't keep on buying them.</p> Like there's other rewards in life, like -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah (laughs). And that's why this month I'm really like trying to, you know, sort of figure it out.</p> And sort of like tell myself no, like, you know, ""If I'm going to get this, then I can't get that.""</p> Probably like some activity. Like bake something or sew, like that's what I did last night is I sewed -</p> Yeah, it felt really good -</p> —because I was just like I got all excited and -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, because I—especially because I got this fabric for—like I bought some fabric from eBay to make pillows, and she gave me a sample fabric—a sample to go along with it. And it's this beautiful fabric and I realized that it—I was like rather than buying a table cloth or table runner, why don't you just use this sample fabric, because it's free. [00:35:20]</p> And like Jeremy like, he was like, ""Ok."" But then like—you know, I got really excited about it and I was cutting it and I was like, ""We're saving so much money.""</p> ""We're saving $70."" And it's very perfect for fall and I think being resourceful actually makes me happy in the long run.</p> I don't have that tinge of feeling guilty. </p> Yeah (laughs).</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, it is. I think I just need to go back on that and I—you know, and it's hard—and I talk to my sister and she's like always buying these little things and, you know—but I sort of realized that—you know, Jeremy—like sometimes—like I can do a frowny face and he'll buy cookies at Trader Joe's, but I think he's a good one, like if I—he knows how to control his impulse purchases.</p> But I need to sort of look for something to replace that excitement. </p> But I do get excited and I was like—the first of the month I was so excited because I got to—I mean, I was—you know, because every first of the month I get like an allowance to spend. [00:36:40]</p> And I was like, ""Yeah, I can buy nail polish."" And you know, but then I sort of—that's when I bought the nail polish and then like, ""Oh, I guess I have to wait on them, and that's it for the month."" And I was like, ""Oooh."" I guess I sort of realized—I mean, it was crazy how excited I got at the first of the month because these were nail polishes that the pigment is no longer available, or at least affordable. So these are like exclusive Indie nail polish (laughs). So I guess—yeah, I guess I sort of realized I have to start finishing my projects -</p> —and using my purchases.</p> And I think that's where sort of the prolonged joy comes from -</p> —is not just buying things but you know -</p> Yeah. [00:37:26]</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> (laughs)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> All right.</p> Oh, that's so long. I was actually really happy that I had therapy today because I—I—I don't know. It felt like a nice sort of—a nice way to end the week. I really enjoy it. [00:38:25]</p> Yeah, it is. It's—it's been really good for me and that's one thing. </p> My mom, she was like, ""Well, if I was—if I could be there, I would thank your therapist for helping you,"" and I was like, ""Well, I will thank her for you.""</p> And for me.</p> (laughs)</p> Yeah.</p>",1
1000133856.txt,"(Chuckle)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Kids are always starting to do (inaudible at 0:00:16.5) going to be tornado and it be a tornado. Go home. (Chuckle) I don't care. (inaudible at 0:00:26.2)</p> No. We had a tornado warning or something - that someone heard something and the word spread and they said, ""Oh, is there going to be a tornado?""</p> Uh-hm. Right. Once I ran and saw we can't go home in the rain. Luckily it died down (Laughter) just in time for them to leave the building. (Laughter). Oh wow. How have you been? (Chuckles) 0:00:58.8</p> (Chuckles) that's good. I've been fine. It's still kind of awkward for me to get started I don't know why. It shouldn't be at this point.</p> Yeah right. It really does. I don't know why it should. It really shouldn't (Chuckles)</p> Yeah that's - I think it's, there again, afraid to take the initiative, afraid to speak up and (Crosstalk) Yeah, just to get started.</p> Yeah right. I shouldn't be like �wow!' I don't think I should be at this point, but anyway. Oh, it was a nice weekend.</p> Well no. (inaudible at 0:01:58.3) I admit there is nothing going on (inaudible at 0:02:02.2). (Chuckles). I (inaudible at 0:02:08.3) we went, oh, we went (inaudible at 0:02:09.1) real good idea he was a friend of Sara's and he was a Baptist minister.</p> But he's Jewish (Chuckles) but he was really a character for leaving the ministry (Chuckles). It was kind of interesting (inaudible at 0:02:30.1) and then Saturday night then (inaudible at 0:02:34.8) Tanya and I went to the show and Tanya came back up to the apartment which is nice (Chuckles). 0:02:40.5</p> Well we made out and all that stuff. It was nice (Chuckles). One thing that is kind of concerning well she says we're making love and all this stuff and she says something like, ""Don't you want to?"" And I said, ""Yes I want to"" and she says, ""Well why not?"" and I said something like ""I'll still have to overcome my fear that something like that and she says, ""Oh! Well what are you worried about?"" I said, ""I don't know, I just don't know."" and she was, ""What's (inaudible at 0:03:22.1) and I said, ""Oh sometimes if I start thinking, if I start worrying about heading (ph) the erection it go and I don't have an erection and all the stuff and she seemed to be very sympathetic about the whole thing (Crosstalk)</p> Yeah. Right.</p> Yeah. Right. I was - which is kind of nice she just said, ""You worry too much."" (Chuckles)</p> So you know.</p> Yeah. Right. She was. I said, ""Yes. You're right."" I said, ""You're right."" So we're talking about it and she said (inaudible at 0:03:57.2) and she says, ""You really want to?"" And I said, ""Yes."" I say I think about her all the time and all that stuff and I say I said that, ""Just I don't know if it's going to take me more time or whatever because I don't know what it is.""</p> And she says she really didn't have much to say about it and but at any rate she knows. (Chuckles).</p> I called her. Yeah.</p> Oh, yeah.</p> It really was. It was really kind of nice. It was really nice. I did a dance of taking her blouse off (Chuckles)</p> What choice - I'm progressively getting better (Chuckles) at any rate (Chuckles). But I enjoyed it much more, in fact, I wasn't - I didn't - I wasn't worried about having an erection as much as I was before. Like it was getting to be easier and easier like -</p> Just too even start making love it's not an awkward feeling.</p> Yeah. Like it's natural. It's kind of - everything is kind of (Crosstalk) -</p> Really. It's - and then it gets better.</p> Yeah. It gets better and instead of like from - it really gets better as you go on (Chuckles). But it was not - it was kind of nice. It really was. And then I said something like, ""I love you."" and she said, ""It's the first time you ever said that."" and I thought, �Wow!' (Chuckles). It was too.</p> Yeah it was. It really was. It was nice to say it and I never realized that I never said it.</p> Oh. Yeah. She does.</p> Uh hmm. Alright.</p> Right. So I just I keep on telling myself ""Well you just can't"" — I just - I keep on saying to myself, ""Why don't I?"" and then I say to myself, ""Well I really want to. Well why don't I?"" Well then I kind of rationalize or something kind of expect everything at once and all this stuff and you have to take things as they come and all this stuff. But still - 0:06:40.7</p> Yeah. Right. Why don't I? Well I really want to -</p> No it doesn't. No.</p> Yeah. Right .</p> Yeah that's it (Crosstalk) yeah, right. That's it (Chuckles) what's stopping me if I really want to? That's (Crosstalk)</p> Uh-huh. Right.</p> I don't know what it is. I really do not know what it is. You know something like - I really don't know what it is. I - maybe something that is (inaudible at 0:07:32.1) (Chuckles) I keep on saying to myself, ""Well of course I'd never really made love to woman before as much as I made love to Tanya now."" and I (inaudible at 0:07:47.4) well I've done that - why should I be afraid of this and I - it's really weird. I don't know why. I really don't know why. (inaudible at 0:08:01.1)</p> Yeah. Maybe .</p> Yeah. I don't know if it's all there or not. I said to myself, ""Well, if she hadn't said anything I might have."" (Chuckles)</p> Like -</p> Yeah. Right (inaudible at 0:08:38.1)</p> Yeah. Right. If she hadn't said anything like �why don't you?' and then maybe I wouldn't have even thought about it I would have just kept on.</p> Yeah. Right. 0:08:49.1</p> Yeah. Right .</p> Yeah. Right (Chuckles)</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Right.</p> Right. Yeah.</p> Uh-huh.</p> That demand. Yeah.</p> Uh-huh. Right. (inaudible at 0:09:22.7) she had mentioned about this guy (inaudible at 0:09:48.8) and she said that she was supposed to - this summer, I guess (inaudible at 0:09:55.0) he wanted her to meet him in Dallas and she was going to and then she changed her mind and she said that's one of the reasons why she's going to stay and so she won't go to Dallas. I didn't actually really give (ph). And why do you have to go to Spain and not go to Dallas?</p> Yeah. Right.</p> No I never really did. I never - I didn't think about that at that time but later on.</p> You know if - just didn't seem to make that much sense; why are you going to Spain not to go to Dallas? Well she probably just really wants to go to Spain but (Chuckles). Which is really kind of weird and I did tell her I said, ""Well when you go I'll miss you."" and all that and she says, ""Well I'm not really sure if I'm going to go or not yet."" At any rate, but she does - she really seems genuinely excited about (inaudible at 0:10:54.5) so maybe she just wants to go to Spain. She says, ""Well she's not going to go to Dallas.""</p> Yeah. Maybe that's — yeah. Right.</p> Uh-huh. That's true. And she would - she was talking about everything else which we had never discussed before. And she said that how he was and what type of a person that he was and very sure and very cocky of himself and (inaudible at 0:11:32.3) everything and all that stuff.</p> Well I - and then she says, ""Well he's a lot like you in many ways."" (Chuckles) and then, ""Oh yeah?"" She says, ""Yeah. He really is like (inaudible at 0:11:47.5)."" But it didn't - knowing, like I said, knowing that he's a 1,000 miles away.</p> Yeah. Right. I don't even know the man.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah. And she says - well she said that when she was down there and her sister was there and he wasn't really the same around her sister and she says well after her sister left and she stayed that extra day that's when he was kind of like himself. But she said - she just - she really didn't - she really - she said she wasn't - she's in love with him too. But she was very honest about it and she does. She said her sister, when her sister was down there, I think he just felt very uncomfortable around her and all that stuff and she says he's kind of black but he's not. She has a feeling that he doesn't want to be black and he says, like, when she looks at him he says you're looking at a (inaudible at 0:13:23.6) man and she, and he's, she says he has all white friends and stuff like that. He has a feeling that she feels sorry he doesn't really want to be black or doesn't like to be black.</p> I was kind of happy she told me. It's kind of nice.</p> Yeah. Well I just I - something we had never really talked about it. She said, ""You never really brought it up."" or something like this.</p> Said it. Yeah. Right. Like she really came out and said how she felt about him and at least you know what you're up against if nothing else.</p> Yeah. Right. Really.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah. Right.</p> Yeah it was right uh-huh. We sat and talked until about 5:00. It was nice. It really was. (inaudible at 0:14:50.9). I saw Jen again this weekend. Remember that girl that - who I've been in and had that experience in bed before? Her name was Jen.</p> Yeah. Right. Her name was Jen and her father had died and so we had gone up to the wake and I haven't seen her in, God, since the Christmas holidays we hadn't seen each other. Tanya really dislikes her and I don't know why. I think to myself, ""Well, I like Jen. I think she's really a nice person."" I'd never go back to bed with her or anything but I really genuinely enjoyed being with her. She's a lot of fun. She's - you can really sit down and have a really nice conversation with her. And she has a thing, and it's interesting, but she knows she's the type of a woman that knows how to deal with men and she knows when to say something and when not to say something and stuff like that. She really genuinely knows; I believe this. And they have a feeling that Jen was a slut, Jen will sleep with anybody and all this stuff and meeting Tanya, and Jean has this feeling, and afterward when we were driving back and I said to Sheila I said oh something about, ""Oh hon, what did you think about seeing Jen again?"" and she said, ""Well"" and I said, ""Well, would you consider going out and seeing her again?"" and she was, ""No, I wouldn't."" She wouldn't go out and I said, ""I would"" and she said, ""Well go right ahead"" (Chuckles). But it was a very sarcastic thing, I think, the way she said it (inaudible at 0:16:54.1).</p> Yeah. Right. (Chuckles) That's the whole thing. I do. I intend to call Jen and keep in contact with her. I mean I'm not just to drop it right there. I really - I enjoyed talking to her. But I'm sure Tanya's thinking, �After what she pulled with you, how could you possibly?' (Chuckle) and I think, ""Well I don't know but I just like the person."" I think she's really nice - really nice being there. (inaudible at 0:17:29.8) I said, ""Well God damn why would go to her father's wake if you didn't intend on seeing her again?"" You didn't come to see her father; he's dead. (Chuckles). The only reason you would come is because you felt something toward her and you would want to see her and express your sorrow to her at least make her feel better about it. Give her company or something else I thought to myself, �Why would you go?' and I didn't ask her (Chuckles) and I should have. I don't know why I didn't ask her but I didn't ask her. I knew her reaction would have been instantaneously like; she'd blowed up right there. (Chuckles). There have been half (inaudible at 0:18:11.5) I should have - it really crossed my mind that, ""What the hell is your problem? Why would you go?""</p> It did.</p> Yeah it was really wrong. It didn't feel anything towards Jen because -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. There was - there really was.</p> It's not like her - she's doesn't feel anything as far as anybody or anything (inaudible at 0:18:46.5) well go to hell she wouldn't go with (inaudible at 0:18:48.3); but it's really not like her. I thought, well she - I knew she didn't like Jen but I thought Jen is still her friend. She's not even in the half (ph) you know.' She doesn't want to see her again.</p> Yeah, but not for Tanya. Well I guess she would (Crosstalk) of course I'm not real social. Yeah. Right.</p> Yeah. That's true. Maybe she felt that Jen probably would do it for her in her situation but (inaudible at 0:19:35.1) that's true. I don't know. It really bugged me think that she'd go. She doesn't even want to see her again (Chuckles). I'll have to ask Jean the same question when I see her again. She went too - she was there. I'll have to ask her the same question it would be interesting to see her reaction. On the way by my folks house afterwards and they - my mother had a shower for my cousin and it was everything - everybody was practically had gone home and we stopped by. But my cousin was there; one of my cousins whose really kind of an ass she really is but - and her husband whose really kind of an ass too but - and her husband has - he really - Tanya said — she was like he's got - he seems to be mentally deficient and he does but - and Tanya couldn't control herself and -</p> No! You know like -</p> Yeah she was kind of laughing and -</p> But he said something; well of course I know him — I don't know him but I've been around him before and I know what he's like and I've never experienced it first time maybe. I don't know. But she was just (Chuckle) she — a couple of cracks that she came out with were really uncalled for and she said she was sorry about it but she said it like — she said it was really funny but I thought to myself -</p> Yeah. Right. I said, ""Didn't - it is my cousin and he just -</p> Yeah. It really -</p> Uh-huh.</p> Right. It really is. I mean, I'm not going to go around and laugh at her cousin or something if they're a little weird. I'm not going to say anything and just for the fact that you're in someone else's home and you don't know who they are or you've never met them before. But it was really - it was kind of - I really didn't like it at all.</p> Yeah. It really did (Crosstalk) and I don't like the law but uh-huh.</p> Yeah. Right. But you have to - well when we sat down and they had left, my cousins, I thought - and my - with just my parents and I and Tanya who were there. And she was very polite and, of course, she would never offend my parents (inaudible at 0:23:04.0)</p> (inaudible at 0:23:05.5) of course you know she knows my parents; she likes them. So (inaudible at 0:23:12.0) and then I'd said my parents and I we had planned to go to California and all that stuff this summer and I was talking to - I called my cousin while I was there and she said she had this [cute thingy] (ph) we might have this six-bedroom place and on the beach and I said, ""Tanya why don't you come out (inaudible at 0:23:35.5) ?"" and she says, "" Well (inaudible at 0:23:37.8)"" We were going to leave on the 14th and she gets back on the back of the 16th or 17th."" Something like that — August. Yeah. But she would - I really like her to come -</p> Yeah. I would like her to come. I don't know if she will or not. At least I extended the invitation (inaudible at 0:23:57.7). At least she knows now that I would want her to come if nothing else.</p> Yeah. Right.</p> Yeah. Right.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah. Right. (Chuckles). I was going to, of course, I wouldn't say anything to her about her when she pisses me off about - when her attitudes -</p> Yeah. I don't say anything then, no, I feel like I should.</p> Yeah. Right.</p> That's true too. (inaudible at 0:24:56.8). Everything's going so well I should keep my mouth shut. Why start a hassle now? But I really thought that I should especially about Jen.</p> Yeah. Especially about Jen.</p> Yeah. That really did irk me. But every time that I know of the last time we talked about her it ended up in a big fight.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah . Right, right about what is your attitude towards her. Of course, at that time, when we had discussed it before she thought Jen was more of a - like she was jealous of Jen. But now I don't know why she would be. She knows that I love her and everything and I told her everything now but- I don't know why she would be now but - and the discussion the topic of marriage is coming up again.</p> Oh, she wants to get married like now. (Chuckles)</p> Yeah. Like now.</p> I said, ""No, I'm sorry I'm just not ready."" and she says, ""Well why not?"" And I said, ""Well I don't feel that I'm really ready. It really frightens me if you want to know the truth"" Well it frightens everybody. Anybody who's ever even thought about it — it's a very frightening thing and she really kind of understood how I felt but she feels kind of the same way. When you really think about it and then she says something about well I said, ""When you think about living with this person for the rest of your life."" Well she goes, ""Well you know for the rest of your life may be tomorrow who knows."" And I said, ""Well maybe but chances are it's probably longer than you've already lived so I'm taking it there.""</p> Um, no. I didn't ask her.</p> (Chuckles). Really. I don't know. Because it's true. I could see why she would want to get married. I guess I just presumed that all women want to get married.</p> Yeah. Right. Maybe I never really - it never really entered my mind, well, why do you want to get married?</p> Yeah. Right. It just -</p> (Chuckles) Yeah. Right. That they just want to get married. (Chuckle)</p> Really. And when I saw Jen and it was really - I really wanted to say - tell Jen that I was involved with Tanya and all this stuff and she says to me, and Tanya and Sara were sitting there so she couldn't talk, (Chuckles). And she said something, ""Why didn't you call?"" ""Gee Jen I don't know."" And it was an awkward situation, her father's dead, and why didn't I call? And so, ""Gee Jen, I really don't know."" She says, ""Did you get tied up? And I said, ""Yeah Jen, I got tied up."" and she goes, ""Really tied up, huh?"" and I said, ""Yeah Jen I did."" And this is the type of a person that Jen is; she knows.</p> She knows what's happening. She's very observant and she knows what's happening and she kind of looked at me with this like a, I don't know if she was really happy about the whole thing, and she says, ""Well that's nice.""</p> Yeah. Right. She really did and that's the type of person she is.</p> She's really perceptive and a very understanding person and I (inaudible at 0:29:32.7) ""Okay Jen, lets step out I want to talk to you."" But then (Chuckle) and that would have been it right then and there.</p> Oh I really would have liked to have talked to her.</p> Yeah, just don't say anything around -</p> Uh-huh. I think right away �there she goes again' as far as Jen is concerned; again off with some man that's the first thing they think of, you know, slut. (Chuckle). I didn't - I know Jen has slept with men and I just that's her business.</p> No. I'm not going to say; ""Well so this is the way she is"" I'm not going to say anything. She is really is observant.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Right. Really. She could - she's the type of person you could really talk to. Sit down and talk to and she'd really understand she really would no matter what. And she kind of really gets that feeling when you're with her.</p> Like I said maybe this is the only way she reacts towards men; she turns women off. I don't know. And I thought this weekend, also, about as far as the question of marriage is concerned I thought if I marry Tanya I have to tell her about my homosexual activities and all that stuff and the more I get involved in everything the less I want to tell her I -</p> Yeah. Really. It doesn't but then I think it would be only right for me to tell her.</p> Yeah. Right to tell her but then I think how would I tell her? Walking up the aisle are you going to say, (Chuckles) ""Well guess what, you know.""</p> No. I can't. I really can't. No.</p> Uh-huh. Yeah. Maybe I've been reading too many Ann Landers or something (Chuckle) I don't know.</p> Yeah. Right. You have to say it all. Everything is based on trust and you don't keep anything from your wife or your husband or whoever. You should just say it all. I don't know if - (Crosstalk)</p> Yeah.</p> Uh-huh. 0:32:39.3</p> That's true too. Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Uh-huh.</p> Right.</p> Yeah. One way I think I should and another way I think I shouldn't. So if she does know or what she knows just leave it at that and say okay just forget it and then in another way I just think well I really should. I don't know.</p> Because I'm - it's something that I am ashamed of and -</p> Yeah. Right.</p> Throw it out. Right.</p> Uh-huh. I don't know if anything like marriage being such an important step that everything is - you're supposed to know everything about everybody and everything about their past and all this stuff. I don't know. If somebody were to tell me, ""Yes, you should"" I probably would.</p> Yeah. Probably.</p> Yes, you should tell her, yeah, and I probably would but -</p> No I don't. I'm afraid to.</p> Yeah. Right. I'm and I'm afraid what her reaction might be and all those stuff.</p> Uh-huh.</p> Yeah. Right. And it's like even when a subject is brought up I just kind of go like, �Oh God!' and maybe - I don't know if she notices my reaction or - we were sitting, the other night in a restaurant, and a couple booths over something like that you know there's three guys and one guy she says, ""He really did look like (inaudible at 0:35:06.2) there's three gay birds"" and all this stuff and I just felt like -</p> Yeah. I just felt like �oh. So what' I just probably felt like telling her �so what?'</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Right. Oh, and there's another guy and she goes and he stood up and she goes, ""Well you couldn't tell with about him but it wouldn't take long"" or something like this. I thought �Oh wow!' (Chuckle). Really.</p> That's why I feel if she knew.</p> If she knew that I'd -</p> Yeah. If — no - if she knew that if she had any kind of inkling that I had had some homosexual activity, why would she say something like that if she knew that it was going to hit me?</p> She doesn't know she doesn't even have any idea because if she did I don't think she'd say anything about them.</p> Really.</p> That's true too (Chuckle). I don't know.</p> Right. Alright then I thought to myself if she does know she's pointing out the fact that would you look at them how queer they are.</p> Yeah. Right. (Chuckle). I thought about it and, no, I don't think she'd say that. I don't know.</p> Yeah. Right. Saying that �look at them you don't want to be like them' or something like that. But I think she's really -</p> That's right. (Chuckle)</p> Yeah.</p> I guess that's another reason why I just couldn't tell her (inaudible at 0:37:52.4) I don't know, but then I think to myself well what if she saw somebody who I at one time, some guy, who I one time had been in bed with or something like this (Crosstalk)</p> Yeah. Right .</p> Yeah. Right of her finding out from (Crosstalk) oh it is; they're very slim. Right.</p> Yeah. Uh-huh. Really.</p> That's the truth and the truth. On Sunday morning I walked over to mass. it was really, I don't know why I went or anything. It was alright and then when it came time when everyone was going up and receiving communion and stuff like that I really I thought to myself I could really confess now and what I did and really be going in and saying the whole situation. And then I'm just I really could - I go back. It's really a good feeling like I had a choice now. Nothing that I could be afraid of because I was doing something about it.</p> Right.</p> Uh-huh. Right.</p> Uh-huh. I really thought about it too and I said, ""Well, hell, I can go and confess it now"" and no bones about it because I'm never going to do it again so it really would be -</p> Over and done with. I really - it wouldn't be like you're going to go and you're going to say it and you're going to go back and do the same thing again. So it was kind of a nice feeling to know that (Chuckle) I at least realized at that point.</p> Yeah. Right. It wasn't all that. Well it was all that; it wasn't all that terrific.</p> (Laughter) it was really not that terrific. It does make some kind of people (inaudible at 0:40:29.4). (Chuckle) (inaudible at 0:40:35.3) the one thing you listen for to go - well the most important thing going, for me, is listening to the sermon; what the man has to say. (inaudible at 0:40:47.5) show (inaudible at 0:40:48.5) to listen to what he has to say is kind of nice. The one priest he was spouting something off he just said so much of the stuff and so little that it was unbelievable. (Chuckle) and oh, God! It was so idealistic and all the world is new and oh, Christ! (Chuckle) It was really unbelievable. I felt like saying, ""Oh, buddy where have you been?"" (Chuckle) I mean he was young and ordained three years and I thought oh, God! Expounding on how beautiful everything was and -</p> Yeah. Right. Just look around you and this - but he said how, oh, the living in the [naked war] (ph) and all this stuff and blah, blah, blah but still -</p> Right. I said, ""Oh Christ!"" It was just unbelievable, unreal (inaudible at 0:41:56.9) and I thought you really can't be that na�ve you really have to you have to get to know the past too (Chuckle).</p> Or maybe he didn't. I don't know. Me being very (inaudible at 0:42:14.1) philosophical (Chuckle) how all these kept on referring to the, how did he put it, was one of the five - the omega the land slider (ph) and the alpha and the omega (inaudible at 0:42:35.4) something about the last (inaudible at 0:42:37.6) but he was at his alpha. (Chuckle) so, wow! I just don't realize how they can come out and say something like this.</p> Yeah. It was a lot of gold shifting. it really was.</p> Well I liked this with this Baptist minister, the other day who I met, and he really seemed like — and it was sad that he was quitting. He's a very funny person, funny about how - he got up and, I don't know, if he meant it to be derogatory but he did a sermon as if he were a homosexual. Like and this is the type of thing - at least he'd have an audience (Chuckle) would be captive and going up and following - he was up in the hierarchy (ph) he pretended that he fell asleep at the pulpit. Something like this and then you can really get the peoples reaction. The least they'd be there and he offered them something.</p> Right.</p> Right. He'd have to go off course. He does want to go into acting, which is kind of sad. Going be up on stage every Sunday morning and people would really listen to him.</p> He would. He really would be good at it and it's sad that he's not doing like he - Sara said that he really freaked the pastor out. He went to the Catholic (ph) church and he went up and received communion and he looks so really Jewish (Laughter) and he got up to the communion rail and refused to be near the baby on its back and he just really psyched this man out - and this was this was a type of a person that they need someone whose really has something to offer.</p> Yeah. He really is. He's very alive person, in fact, I was mentioned to Sara that I'd like to, some Sunday, I would like to go out and listen to one of his sermons and see what they're like before he quits. Of course they stuck him in he's in the (inaudible at 0:44:58.9) area too he's got like 50 parishioners and (Chuckle)</p> Yeah. At one time it was a really a large parish and then the neighborhood changed and no one comes to the church anymore. So and it's really sad that they would stick him in a place like this where he's reaching no one and he's - that's why one of the reasons, I believe, he's leaving is because there's nothing to do. Well there is, I know, (inaudible at 0:45:30.5) what do you mean there's nothing to do? There's so much to do, but I guess in his line of work, I don't know, what there is to do (inaudible at 0:45:38.8) Sara said she was with him the other day and he stopped on the highway to help this girl change her tire from the save one soul (ph) (Laughter). He didn't even know how to change a tire (Laughter) and he has no idea that some guy on a motorcycle stopped and he let him change the tire and he took the girls red jacket and waving down (Laughter) (inaudible at 0:46:02.7).</p> Okay.</p> Yeah.</p>",2
1000013238.txt,"[See, I've had a vacation] (ph). It's two weeks now.</p> Not really. Kind of getting used to not working.</p> At first, the boredom was tremendous. I just kind of accept it.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I just kind of stay in bed. What makes it better is that you can stay up late the night before and you don't feel like getting up until like 11:00, then half the day is gone, so you don't have too much to ...too much time to fight that.</p> There's (ph) not really too much of a drive for it because I don't really need the money that bad.

[0:02:11]</p> [Kind of, yeah] (ph) It doesn't really make that much difference whether I'm working or whether I'm not working. Of course (inaudible at 0:02:29). That was kind of an exception.</p> Yeah. Because most of them ... seems like a dead end, really, working, because most of the jobs that I CAN get are the kind that are boring and that are just kind of menial and any 14-year-old could do this stuff. I've had jobs ...</p> I was thinking what it would be like to be a truck driver. I've been thinking about that for about a week. And a couple of days ago, no, a bit longer than a couple days ago ... but in that time, there was one day where I was very intent on calling this one man, he's a truck driver, he has his own cab and everything. And he's very accomplished at it. He's a good driver, and he has all kinds of contacts with different trucking firms and docking facilities and people that rent things, and anything about driving a truck, or any contacts, he would know something about how to get into it. And he's a fairly good friend, so I was thinking of calling him. And I was driving down this road near our house and all that was on it ... there's a main highway about two blocks from our house, and all that was on it was semis. And right in the middle of about four semis that were all spitting out their exhaust and the air was kind of ... (coughs to illustrate) you know, like when you're following a bus. I just [want to go] (ph), ""Am I going to start adding to that now?""</p> Adding to that. It just doesn't seem to fit me. I like driving. I love being around machines that I can control and that are kind of ... I don't know, I guess I can just kind of feel with the machine.</p> Not ""with,"" but I can know exactly what's happening in that machine. Like my friend's Barracuda, which he totaled out, used to have four speed transmission and a very good engine. And I liked driving it. It would take five miles an hour in first gear, another five in second ... [it was killing that car] (ph).</p> I'm not used to driving a four-speed. In fact, I have an automatic, but still kind of car (inaudible at 0:05:43) I learned on a stick two years ago, three years ago. But then I've long since forgotten that. I mean, not forgotten ... been out of practice. And driving about four blocks in this guy's car, just driving around the block, I got so that I could shift it better than he could, and he's driving for four months.</p> And I could just kind of feel, he didn't have a tachometer in his car, and I could just kind of feel when the engine wouldn't go any faster without (inaudible). And he thinks he has a real (inaudible) for a car and it's not that bad (ph).</p> Yeah. I could ... in his car ... he has a 273 Barracuda, and I think it would be very easy to beat a (inaudible) 86 (ph) Chevelle in that car. And he can't even take on a VW! Well, I shouldn't go that far, but he has a little trouble between shifts, he'll take a lot of time between shifts.</p> (inaudible at 0:07:00)</p> I like to take his ... I used to like to take his car. It's no longer running (ph). Somebody hit him. The car is totaled now, which is a shame. But anyway ...I almost wiped his car out once going around a corner. I wasn't really wiping out, I was just out of control kind of, but it never seemed to really get out of control. It just looked kind of [going out] (ph). It was fish tailing and going down the street sideways and I suppose it looked kind of wild. It felt kind of wild but it's instinct for me.</p> Getting out of hairy situations driving.</p> Well I put myself into them. It's almost suicidal the way I do that sometimes. [0:08:13]</p> Yeah. Not so much with the car I have now, that's kind of a pig (ph) doesn't do anything. But with other cars that go a little faster. I'm kind of the opinion where ...</p> I have kind of a theory about how people get really good at something. How you practice it until it becomes unconscious. And if you do it and you're conscious of what you're doing, you're going to blow it. But if you do it when you're UNCONSCIOUS in doing it, like if it's just, it happens so fast that it's automatic, then it comes out right. And the army has proof that they have these people who site for gun ranges for flying missiles, for flying targets. I don't know really what it is, but there's this one person that does the job of calling out the range and the bearing of the target. And they found that if you can do it within three- or four-tenths of a second from the time that's expected of him, from the time he sees it, if he can get on a bearing in that time, it will be more accurate than if he waits one or two seconds. Which, to me, is amazing. Like the way people play pool sometimes. They have to kind of get into a trance before they really get good. [0:10:08]</p> Yeah. Driving. I just ... I don't even bother thinking about what I'm doing, I just do it. I wish I could do that all the time. I was wondering whether I have too much time to think, just staying at home [like that] (ph).</p> [And again] (ph). Well maybe it was too much time. Maybe I overdid it. I started thinking of things to do that were destructive rather than constructive. Well, I don't know. Maybe it just seems like [they were] (ph).</p> Yeah, like in the past week, [I broke up kind of with my girl] (ph), I almost wrecked my friendship with the girl in the hospital (ph), become kind of generally intolerant of people.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I wondered what it was like to [be dead] (ph).</p> Again, I wondered what it was like to [be dead] (ph).</p> Yeah, it's just kind of a general negative feeling. All I can see is the bad.</p> Yeah. Like it's just the whole way I view things is coming out negative rather than positive.</p> Like now, and for the past couple days or weeks.</p> Just kind of ... not so much worried about other people just ... maybe angry at myself sometimes. Like this morning, I was driving down the street. It's a four-lane highway. And I ... I guess you could consider it cutting this guy off but he was [only doing 10 miles an hour] (ph) I was doing about 15 (ph), so I didn't really cut him off, but I went between him and a truck and I should have known better because I couldn't see what was on the other side of the truck. And I get on the other side of this truck into the opposite lane where I could have passed the truck, but there's a car (inaudible at 0:13:25). Stupid.</p> Yeah. I've been thinking of all the ... not now, but (inaudible at 0:14:02) after the moment, after the past week, I've been kind of thinking of all the different reasons for breaking up with my girlfriend. (inaudible) Monday night.</p> It didn't do what I expected. I expected it would give me kind of ... I don't know if you could call it ""freedom"" or not, but I wouldn't be so dependent on her. And it hasn't done that.</p> A little bit, yeah. But it's more like I expected her to stop being dependent on me along [with that] (ph), and it didn't happen [at all] (ph).</p> No, I didn't expect that. But I expected kind of a change in the kind of relationship we would have.</p> Yeah. [0:16:19]</p> Yeah, except my mother's always screaming at me. And that makes it a rather unpleasant experience.</p> And if not yelling ... yeah, intruding. Always running [in the room to put clothes away] (ph) or banging doors or slamming the doors down or just kind of stomping about, making noise. She makes more noise than three people I know, any three people.</p> Yeah, although I wouldn't mind something happening, but not that.</p> And then she expects me to talk to her all the time. Like today, she [called me out for being a poor conversationalist] (ph), and I didn't even answer, which I (inaudible). [0:18:09]</p> (inaudible) There's no desire to talk.</p> Yeah. And I tried to sell my engine last weekend. Had ads in two newspapers, two ads in each newspaper and I got two calls and I wasn't home for either of them. When they called me back, I wasn't (inaudible at 0:18:43).</p> I'm going to try again this weekend. Just one ad this time in two papers. Maybe I can raise that money to pay (inaudible). Anyway, it will get this stuff out of the garage.</p> It will get this stuff out of the garage without throwing it out. I couldn't stand throwing out ... I'd give it away, but I wouldn't throw it out.</p> I never ... I don't know why, but it seemed to be valuable to me but to nobody else. In their present form, they're not really valuable. They could be more valuable except I don't have any money to put into them. And it takes a lot of money to (inaudible). [0:20:07]</p> It's quite impossible.</p> Yeah. I suppose if it gets bad enough, I'll decide to get a job. [Like I even] (ph) feel kind of trapped sometimes (inaudible).</p> Kind of like ... [I don't know] (ph) ... she wants to have someone who is very close to her, to really appreciate her all the time, that makes her feel good. And just knowing that, I feel like it's kind of expected of me. And it seems like kind of a demand that sometimes I really don't care about.</p> Yeah. I think that's what I was trying to get out of by giving back the ring.</p> It's kind of like I wanted to ... to be just as close to her but not all the time.</p> [And then] (ph) sex keeps coming up too, which kind of confuses everything.</p> I don't know, it's kind of ... it's a different ... it's different, it's ... sometimes, because it's so frustrating to be so close to her and yet so far away. And I'm very tempted to go out with other girls and I know I couldn't ... I couldn't justify that to myself when I still had her ring. So I gave back her ring and I still can't justify it to myself. It's kind of like a block in my mind that says no.</p> Yeah, a little bit. I just don't feel right about it somehow.</p> Mmm. And then it's ... on top of it, that kind of seals the trap, you know? Because it's very frustrating. It seals the feeling of being trapped to Mary because she doesn't really satisfy me at all.</p> Yeah. And she doesn't even try. That's what's really bad.</p> Yeah. It's a dead end.</p> Yeah, because [there's no place to go] (ph).</p> Mmm hmm. [0:28:19]</p> Having sex. And coming out with the ... my friend in the hospital Sunday and that's how it was. That's all I could think about. And ...</p> Yeah, and she's not really interested in that at all.</p> And to know that if I just say one thing that isn't new [with that] (ph).</p> If I just ... like if I just would say to her anything having to do with a personal sexual relation with me, that I think it would completely ruin our friendship.</p> Yeah. [0:30:05]</p> No, it's a desire to kind of get rid of everything that's [bugging me] (ph).</p> Yeah. I always did like getting drunk. I usually (inaudible) alone or with someone that I would really feel close to. And I usually had a ball (ph). Just in my own way, kind of. Sometimes (inaudible).</p> Yeah. I can get real happy when I'm drunk. Most people get mad or belligerent or depressed. I get (inaudible). [I can kind of] (ph) see sometimes how thinking about things winds me up in the circles and then I kind of lose all perspective on everything. [0:32:36]</p> Yeah. A little bit.</p> It's like not being able to understand what's going on from any point of view just because of chaos and confusion.</p> Yeah, like I was trying to read Bertrand Russell this morning, and normally anything with abstract logic in it is just kind of child's play. It's very easy. I just kind of breeze through it. In fact, I can skim the page and get more out of it than somebody who studies it for an hour. Well not everybody, but some of them. I've known people that I can do that to. And this morning, I couldn't understand it at all. Like I would read it, I would see the words but nothing together. I didn't even see the point he was trying to make sometimes, let alone the logic behind it.</p> Yeah, it leaves you kind of lost.</p> Yeah. And I did get a couple points out of it, and I tried to compare that to some of my own thoughts that I think are fairly (ph) original sometimes. And I couldn't do it at all because I couldn't even remember my own thoughts. Things that I had worked out in my own mind I couldn't remember.</p> Yeah, when they were straight in previous times.</p> Yeah. That little cabin at the top of the hill in the middle of Montana somewhere is looking pretty good again.</p> Yeah. I completely stopped listening to AM radio. [0:36:26]</p> Next to none.</p> When I stop listening to FM, next after that would be records.</p> Yeah.</p> Like selling my engine was a major decision to me. Not because I thought I'm going to sell them and might even get some money out of it. It wasn't like that at all. It was kind of like ... cleaning up your estate before you commit suicide. [That's what it felt like] (ph).</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. My parents are planning on moving (ph). They have this lot all picked out and the bid has been accepted on it and it's about 10 miles from ... farther from the city. And they're planning on building a house on it. Supposedly everyone's going to have their own rooms and it's going to be all cozy. I just wonder what it would be like to have [to have a room of my own] (ph).</p> [Yeah, then I could lock my door.] (ph)</p> I took my brother for a ride, well he drove actually, [he drove me in] (ph) my car, and before we went, my dad wanted to know the exact route we were taking driving. [0:40:22]</p> And on top of that ... well, that I'm kind of used to. He does that all the time. But then he holed (ph) my brother up for about half and hour. I'm just standing there waiting, and he's yelling at my brother and [my brother] (ph) (inaudible) sitting there thinking how stupid my father is.</p> No, I can see that he was doing that. Because I felt that way when I get yelled at. He's a lot like me. [I think we can understand each other] (ph)</p> The point that ... the main point they were arguing is about ... my father makes up all kinds of little arguments about coming home late and leaving without previous notice. He wants to be notified of everything three hours in advance, but he's not home more than a half hour [in advance] (ph).</p> And then he wants to know the exact route and he wants to have it timed so that he knows the exact minute we're supposed to get back. The thing that he was concerned about is my brother going out with me because I'm such a bad influence. And he won't say that. He'll never admit that.</p> Yeah. It's so obvious.</p> And then ...</p> He doesn't like my brother to go anywhere. He'd rather just have him sit home. But yet he complains when I sit home. I (inaudible at 0:42:10) but ...</p> It just ... that wasn't the point I wanted to make.</p> I just threw that in. But see my brother, he would rather have sit home because if he doesn't go out, he can't get into trouble. And so anytime he goes out, he gets this hassle. He gets it doubly much when he goes out with me, which has only been, like, twice. (inaudible) never taken him driving.</p> And then what makes it even worse, is that my father has a suspicion that my brother might end up driving. (sarcastically) ""And oh, that would be awful! My brother driving. Oh dear, he's only 16."" And he's so afraid that kid is going to get out of the house and actually see somebody that's alive. That is pitiful.</p> Yeah, well I kind of think that our family is dead.</p> Yeah.</p> And when we went out to see this lot ... was it two nights ago, that he had picked out and everything, and we were surveying it and doing this little test (inaudible) with it, to make sure that we had the proper septic system to go in there. And when we got all done, we were driving home and he gives me this little lecture about how I shouldn't take my brother out without his express permission and all that garbage. And it was so ridiculous. I just helped him for three hours, probably if he would have had it done, it would have cost him a small fortune, but yet because he had help, he can do it. But if I wouldn't have helped him, he couldn't have done it because you need somebody to hold the pole (ph) when you're surveying it. [0:44:56]</p> Yeah. So he comes on with this lecture about how I was pulling stunts on him, you know, like that. It's the only thing I do is try and sneak him out behind his back and that I'm just bringing my brother to corrupt him. It was so ridiculous.</p> Yeah, I did, I laughed in his face. It was so ridiculous. How ... it almost seemed like ... like people yell ""communism,"" you know? It's like a big bogeyman, and that's the way he looks at everything.</p> Yeah. I can see the same pattern is forming what I found in my kind of ... well I think it's kind of a fight to get out and be independent. It only took me from 16 to 19 and I didn't really start until I was 17. Well he's only 16, and he's already starting the patterns and he's well advanced on any stage that I was at when I was his age. In fact, he's beating me by about a year-and-a-half in progression on things.</p> Only faster.</p> And my parents are making the same stupid mistakes. They never learn.</p> Yeah. My brother went on this island (ph) last week for the whole week. I guess it was seven or eight days. And when he went, I know he took along at least three or four pints of alcohol and I don't know how much his buddy took along and then his girlfriend [went with too] (ph). It was like a church retreat. And it was pretty nice up there. (inaudible at 0:48:08) and I guess he had pretty much of a good time. And it was a big plus having his girlfriend along too. (inaudible) And he came home with ... he was unpacking and he's throwing out all this assorted contraband that he either brought with him or picked up at this (inaudible). It's evil in our family to smoke, so he comes back with two packs of cigarettes and a lighter. And it makes it fairly obvious. It doesn't matter to me. He knows it doesn't matter to me. So it doesn't matter to him (inaudible). And so he piles all of this stuff in the drawer (ph) and (inaudible). He shot off all these firecrackers. He had (inaudible) and cherry bombs that he was blowing up [all over the place] (ph). And he was telling me about some of the stuff they were doing up there and how he and his girlfriend just didn't bother to go to these activities that they had all planned. And how he kind of ... he just used his brain and he just pretty well did what he wanted to and no one (inaudible) difference the whole week.</p> Yeah, except a little bit more intelligent.</p> Yeah. And then he came home with the ... he threw this pack of cigarettes at me, I'm sitting on their bed and he said ""Here, have one."" And I said, ""No thanks, I don't smoke."" He says, ""Oh, why not?"" [There's a roll of joints and papers.] (ph) And I just looked at it and I said, ""You've got to be kidding. Any different than alcohol?"" And he said, ""No, it's all the same. It doesn't make any difference."" [So I don't know really what's going to happen to him then. I hope he doesn't get too deeply involved] (ph). [0:50:35]</p> Yeah. But it's something that he's going to have to figure out that I really can't do anything about.</p> I just keep waiting until this (inaudible) over. Maybe I'll be allowed to [go somewhere] (ph).</p> Yeah.</p> Allowed to just be ... just do what I want. I think the first thing I'd do if I had any money, would be to get in my car and start driving west.</p> Yeah, maybe [up to Canada] (ph) or Montana. [Or I] (ph) would just drive all over.</p> Yeah. I wonder what it would be like to sleep in my car.</p> I wonder what it would be like to sleep in the car.</p> Yeah. That would be pretty [lonely too] (ph).</p> There's not that many people I can talk to here (inaudible).</p> I'm just afraid to talk to people now. I think there was only a couple people I could talk to.</p> Well yeah, like I'll say something and it would be kind of unacceptable. [I know] (ph). Like I've made a few friends, you know, and I have my girlfriend who I can talk to sometimes. Like while I was making these friendships, I could just talk about what I felt. And it seemed that they liked me for it. Now I feel kind of guilty because I can't really say what I think.</p> I feel kind of guilty about what I'm thinking.</p> Like, sometimes when I'm thinking about sex, or just getting away from everything including the person I'm talking to, and I don't feel like I can say that to a person right to his face.</p> Yeah.</p> I can't say to my girlfriend, ""All I can think about is sex tonight."" It doesn't make any difference. It doesn't help.</p> I could say it, yes, but it wouldn't help. It doesn't make any difference. It would still be the same.</p> I feel like I'm kind of closing in and all I can talk about now is things that seemed important to me that maybe I'm missing something that is really important.</p> No, I know what you mean. Like there's something behind all of this.</p> Something bigger that ... I don't really see.</p> Yeah, that's why I wouldn't talk about it. I can't talk about ...</p> Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. That's kind of, kind of goes along with the same line where I don't really feel like ... I don't really feel like talking about some things or that I don't think it will help by just talking about them.</p> I don't think it would help change anything by talking about things sometimes.</p> Mmm hmm.</p> No. [And we probably won't either.] (ph) We talked a little bit about that too. And it just kind of ... I don't know. It just ... it doesn't seem to satisfy her at all to even think about it. Like she just has no desire for it. And ...</p> Yeah.</p> See the reason she really has no desire is just ... she just doesn't feel right about it.</p> Yeah. And so I can't really be disappointed, because that's just the way she is. I don't feel right about feeling disappointed.</p> Because it would be like expecting something that she can't possibly do.</p> No, I think it would show through.</p> And it would make her feel bad. And ...</p> No, just the opposite. I'd rather just kind of try and forget ...</p> Well, not really feel bad. I'd rather just try and forget it. And I don't know, maybe I'm just forcing myself to do something that isn't going to happen.</p> To forget.</p> Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes I think how stupid I am and then I go the opposite and I become very intolerant and cold, kind of nasty.</p> Yeah.</p>",0

But again I don't know how I-how the whole thing would come about. Turn out, how the whole thing would turn out. I really have no idea. </p> I don't think so. </p> The thing is that-if I had had a sexual relationship with a woman, it wouldn't be like-I wouldn't like to have any commitment toward this woman as far as the relationship is concerned. So if I had a sexual relationship with a woman I'd just like to be able to (inaudible at 0:06:44.6). And just walk away and forget the whole thing. </p> Yeah right. That's what-you know. Yeah right. You got it. That's about it. </p> I-I'm - the way that I have been brought up, and I was brought up in a Catholic school and parochial school. And you always respect a woman. You don't ever touch a woman or anything like this. You know this is (inaudible at 0:07:40.4). It's just something that isn't done. And, you know this is what had been pounded into my head. (inaudible at 0:07:50.7) You always respect a lady (inaudible at 0:07:57.6). </p> Yeah, more or less. But it was like you just don't, unless of course you're married. By that time, who knows what may come about.</p> Yeah I think that why-definitely why I'd be afraid of a -</p> Well you know like-(inaudible at 0:09:01.2). So like a person-if you had been a virgin. And you find that most people are wilder (inaudible at 0:09:12.9). For you it's more when you're drinking. And if you're not-I probably don't. A hell of a lot more comfortable here, drunk, something I don't know. High or something. And this is probably-you know this is probably you know, what it's like. </p> Yeah right. </p> Right. You just don't-you don't feel-really drunk but just kind of drunk. </p> Yeah. That's (inaudible at 0:09:57.6). It's not a very comfortable feeling. I should get drunk more often. I don't know. </p> (inaudible at 0:10:18.6)</p> My nervousness? </p> Yeah. I've actually done some though and experienced something. It's not a nervousness anymore. It's just kind of a first crack at it, like I needing help (ph). Besides I'm really kind of... more or less a-you're not really-</p> Yeah you're relaxed (ph)! Yeah they used to have these-the first time in anything that I found myself I would be nervous. The first time in anything. I... (inaudible at 0:11:06.7). Stuff like that. I found myself getting better-(inaudible at 0:11:10.6). It really didn't bother me. I really wasn't apprehensive-like I was before. I (inaudible at 0:11:18.6) and stuff like. I could barely open up my mouth. </p> I don't know. Maybe it's because you're afraid of failure. Because whatever you do you're afraid you're going to do... more or less shot down. </p> Not-sometimes that's how I feel. Maybe-like this thing here, I probably-maybe-the more experience and my knowledge more or less is at the bottom of my experiences. And maybe the... (inaudible at 0:12:11.3). I'd rather feel like... (inaudible at 0:12:16.1). </p> Yeah right. ""Let's just do the same old stuff."" </p> No I don't think so. I really don't. Because you know-there, in that type of (inaudible 0:12:45.0) situation would arise, I would be apprehensive about, more or less, even going with the situation. And it wouldn't be a sense of failure. Not until I realized that I had failed, if I couldn't fail.</p> Yeah. That's it. </p> Yeah. That's it. (nervous laugh)</p> The problem is finding a woman. I mean you know like I said, I don't think that I know-I'd be very apprehensive about having sex, now, with a woman who I'm very familiar with, with no commitment at all. But with someone else I think it would be very much, less, apprehensive or something? </p> Yeah. See, the woman-she'd would have to name, set the game. (inaudible at 0:14:08.5)</p> Uh-uh. No. (laughs)</p> Maybe that's it. Maybe nervousness and not knowing what to do. (laughs) I don't know.</p> Not pulled in... you know. Yeah I just do that. But other wise, it's good enough to a (inaudible at 0:14:46.5). And, I don't know maybe I don't have that much respect for it, getting back to the idea of respecting all women. Maybe that's a woman who I didn't have that much respect for. I really didn't feel like I'm doing anything dirty. </p> Right, right. </p> Yeah you know like, afterwards, there are guilt complexes and things like that. But (inaudible at 0:15:50.9). Not at the time. </p> No, no. Yeah right. I try to stifle it. And-</p> Right. From the sex and toward, sex within myself, I try to stifle it. </p> Yeah.</p> And you know more or less, yeah. And (inaudible at 0:16:30.5) in wars and things like that. All sorts of stuff. </p> Right. </p> Yeah but it's-kind of hard. (laughs) Silence. (laughs)</p> Yeah it does. Yeah it makes me nervous. Except for after the game (ph). </p> Pardon me?</p> Oh well I mean-I teach school. On Friday afternoons it's always (inaudible at 0:17:18.7). so that's why, after I haven't experienced silence for all afternoon. </p> Uh-huh. </p> Yeah. Right. (laughs) I never did understand it. You know. With someone. I can experience silence by myself, and just kind of relax and fall out. But with someone it's kind of nervous. I tend to fill in silence with someone else sitting right. I feel like, ""Wow, I better say something."" </p> Right. </p> Talking? Yeah, it doesn't make me more nervous. But, I don't know what to say. And that makes me nervous. And I don't know-if I don't have anything to say, then I get nervous. (inaudible at 0:18:46.6)</p> Yeah, that's true. If you'd ask me a question I'd answer it. (inaudible at 0:19:25.2)</p> Yeah that's true. But I mean it doesn't do me a whole lot of good just to talk about them. </p> Yeah, I could-I could go to the confessional, and talk there. I don't know. It's just one of those things. I've done that before, too. Didn't do me a whole lot of good either. </p> Yeah. Yeah right. I don't even know, as far as a psychiatrist's role is supposed to be. </p> What your role is supposed to be. </p> Yeah. What you're supposed to do. </p> I said it all to myself, many many many times. </p> And so, ultimately I would just go further. And wouldn't I going further solve the problem? </p> I don't see how it's separate. </p> God I hope not. No. If I did I wouldn't be here, that's it. No, that's why-well-I just hope not. Maybe I'll be able to answer your question after we're all through. If it is unsolvable, we'll know. I don't know. </p> Yeah. Frustrated. </p> Yeah, at least the way it could be. As far as I-I'd like to get married and all this stuff. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. And I'd like to share feelings with someone and do things and all that sort of stuff. Of course sometimes, I'd like to be alone too. </p> No I don't want a whole lot-you know like when... everything's contained, if I want something, if I want it to be there. </p> Yeah. </p> Right. I don't want to keep anybody out. The whole thing.</p> Say for instance if I did get married. And then you know, I did get married. And I had found out that I really feel - that I'm gay. I don't have a sexual identity. And it'd be-I don't want to cheat anybody out. (inaudible at 0:23:52.5) That's why. That's why I'd be apprehensive about getting married. And knowing whether I enjoy it. </p> Right. That's the whole thing. Maybe when I have - - when I run up with this woman, who isn't-doesn't have any commitment, it'll solve my problem. </p> I don't know. I said maybe. (laughs)</p> I don't know how to say I'm (inaudible at 0:24:40.4). </p> I - they just-you-they just, you meet a man. I can meet him in a john or anywhere. They're always willing to take the initiative, that's all. But like I said, a woman won't. Or doesn't. Or I haven't run up with any, that do, more or less, if you want to call them a prostitute or a whore or whatever. But I haven't run up with. One-well-I know a girl who-we had been to bed together and all that stuff. I'd never been real nervous or anything. And then I said, ""Okay"" and she said, ""No."" And that just blew that [whole thing] (ph). </p> Yeah we had been -  we were in bed together and making love and all this stuff. And you're ready to experience intercourse and she said, ""No."" </p> You know shot me right down. I said, ""Okay. Goodbye."" </p> Yeah right! It's like, ""Well why'd you go this far?"" That was the whole thing. Well what, you know, why? </p> Yeah right. That was like-that was it, then and there. I was like, ""Okay, goodbye."" You know that was it. </p> No, about... two years back. </p> Oh it was nice. I enjoyed it. I really did. I was aroused and everything else. And it was nice. </p> Oh no. No, it's not that. </p> Most women. </p> Oh yeah. I do, yeah.</p> That was it. </p> Oh! It was more-she again was that type of a woman. Who more or less said, ""Okay, let's-we can go to bed together."" I said, ""Fine."" And then we went to bed together. And then-she just said, ""No."" And then I said to myself, ""What were you trying to prove?"" And I knew her-I knew her quite well. But... I knew her quite well but I also knew that-she sleeps with other men and all this stuff. So I wasn't like-I wasn't going to be the first or anything as far as that was concerned. So I wasn't going to have even have that commitment or anything else like that. One of those-cheats (ph), I don't know. </p> Yeah it did. Yeah it did. But still-I saw her after that, and I still talk to her once in a while and stuff like that. It isn't like I don't talk to her or anything like that. </p> Oh... she had me (inaudible at 0:28:33.3). She couldn't take this and all this stuff. And she (inaudible at 0:28:37.5) birth control pills and all confused and concerned that she might become pregnant, all be all (inaudible at 0:28:44.6). </p> And I, like I said, I felt that, ""Well, if you had known this before, then why did you even start?"" As far as this was concerned. </p> No. No I didn't. Actually she was enjoying herself too. I think she was. She sure acted like it -  yeah right. She told me it wasn't that (ph). </p> Yeah. Right. That was it. </p> No, no. </p> Yep. </p> And why I don't take the initiative. (laughs) That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe it's because, like I said, the way that I was brought up. ""You'd better take the initiative."" </p> Mm-hm. I know. At this point I should've outgrown it. </p> Oh yeah. </p> Yeah. Uh-huh. That's good. Maybe if I (inaudible at 0:30:31.3) one, and found out that I really enjoyed it. Then I would have enough to know that I really enjoyed it. And then I'd know, if I enjoy it this much, it at least gives me the incentive to take the initiative.</p> Yeah right. It did. Because then-</p> It was never really completed. It was like it was just, half-there. And that was it. It was really kind of bad. </p> No. I don't think so. Because the last time she took the initiative too. I don't think so no. I mean that's not-I mean you know like I said, if someone-if a woman approached me and said 'Okay, let's go to bed."" I wouldn't-I would be happy to answer because (inaudible at 0:31:47.1). But no. I would. </p> Yeah. I would. (inaudible at 0:31:58.7) You know what I mean. As far as-like I said I'd really like to know, what the ultimate outcome would be. </p> Right, right. I understand. Really I do. </p> Yeah that's true. That's true. Have a regular affair then. (laughs)</p> I don't really -  really that's the whole thing. What's keeping me from taking the initiative. I don't know. My own head maybe. Particularly the way I was brought up. Saying I don't (inaudible0:32:55.6) sex with women. Play with her. Don't ever. It's just like-she's the one who guides the way. She's the one who says, ""Yes."" She's the one who says, ""No."" And what she says, you do. You just - </p> Yeah, she calls the shots. </p> Suppose she says, ""Okay."" And she's just going to go and approach me off the street. Not the way our society is (inaudible at 0:33:42.6). At least a society that has (inaudible at 0:33:46.9). </p> Yeah I-I. I don't know if I want to or not. The only way I would take an initiative or any sort of initiative, if I had a sign from her. It's the only way. </p> If I didn't have a sign and I took the initiative. That would mean that she would, flat (ph) down that she would say, ""Yes."" </p> (inaudible at 0:34:58.7) I'm just afraid of doing-(inaudible at 0:35:02.1). I can - </p> Yeah you finally-yeah and you finally get enough nerve to stop and then you say, ""No."" Yeah, that might be it. And you say, ""No"" too. </p> Yeah, right. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> That's true. I (inaudible at 0:36:02.5) a big fat ""No"" to. I'm the type of person that really takes this-really personally. And something else-you really-okay, hell with you. You know but I did take it personally. </p> Right. I know. Yeah right. Even I-I want to feel close to her. At (ph) a dance. And she would say, ""No."" I'd kind of take as a rejection. </p> Oh yeah. When we-when I was in high school. Of course it didn't-it didn't stop me from asking any others to dance, but I did, have a feeling of you know, (inaudible at 0:37:01.4). I may have sulked for a minute or two. </p> Yeah. [Not a whole lot] (ph) but they were all-I've come to the conclusion, just to, now it really wasn't anything. You know, but at that point it was something, asking a girl to dance in high school and then she said, ""No.""</p> Oh yeah it was. It really was. </p> Yeah. Of course I wouldn't even ask the girl if she would like to go to bed with me. I couldn't. It would be like-I wouldn't ask her if she wanted to go to bed. I don't think I could. I really don't. </p> Yeah right. That's true. That's true. But I-</p> No I couldn't. I really-I don't have that (inaudible at 0:38:12.1). [Really ask her] (ph) if she really wanted to go to bed with me.</p> Yeah.</p> That's right. You don't even kiss a girl unless you have respect for her. That's the way it was. You don't even kiss a girl unless you really have respect for her. You really like this person, but you don't even kiss a girl. And that's the way it was. You don't-it was like you just don't. </p> (inaudible at 0:39:07.4) I just-I just think back to the things that, being brought up the way I was. Look back at the things that had been said. It was just like, (inaudible at 0:39:22.5) it really wasn't. </p> Oh yeah, you know- going to grammar school. You just don't-you don't go near a girl. You don't have any girl-boy things. And stuff like that. Oh, I remember, in grammar school, I'd [go on] (ph) a retreat and all the girls would leave and the boys would stay. It was just one, retreat. That was pretty-it was very exciting. But they said, oh God. ""Never masturbate. And if you ever experience an erection, make the sign of the cross and it will just go away."" </p> Oh yeah, it's bad. You really had to say the prayer and it would just go away. And then, they'd show, Walt Disney movies and shows like that. It was like, ""And don't you dare laugh."" It was like-yeah, but you know, brainwashed children like this. (inaudible at 0:40:46.2) Chicago. </p> In a way you could do it too. </p> Oh yeah-I can-I'm, yeah. </p> Yeah. I felt that I had been brainwashed. And I still think that it wasn't good. </p> Even if I was, (inaudible at 0:41:10.9) everybody else is concerned, I-my body (inaudible at 0:41:13.1) every day. But, now I don't though. But I still-I say to myself I'll go back one day. I'd love to (inaudible at 0:41:23.5). It's part of me and I believe in it. I don't know if I-yeah, I believe in it. I believe in it. And it's part of me. (inaudible at 0:41:35.9) </p> Feels kind of nice. It wasn't-things have changed a little bit, as far as, everything else was concerned. It was kind of nice. It was - I think I may go back and take it up again. (inaudible at 0:41:58.1) But you know it's like, I can't really be a part of it because living in sin, I could never-I could never receive holy communion and I could never really fulfill the whole bit unless I confess. And, that's what's, (inaudible at 0:42:16.8). </p> It wasn't worth up to the sense that I was afraid to go, no. And go up and tell them and afraid of being balled out probably. </p> Telling them about my-you know, myself and my sex life and everything else. </p> Yeah, right. Oh God, yeah. </p> Oh yeah. Right. I really am afraid to go and tell them, what it was. Which I -  which they say I shouldn't be. We were always -  that's the way I'd been, the way I was brought up. And I didn't have too many-there was a couple of times (inaudible at 0:42:59.4), you were balled out in the confessional. But nothing really, terribly [would go down] (ph). You were always afraid to (inaudible at 0:43:05.8) because you were afraid of what you might experience inside the confessional.</p> Oh yeah, I do. </p> Yeah. Yeah. Not as much-</p> Yeah, not as much-like I said I just kind of tried to block the whole thing out of my mind. But it always came up. Yeah, I had the feeling that I had been doing something wrong. (inaudible at 0:43:42.9). </p> Yeah right, yeah. (inaudible at 0:43:48.7) terrible. Yet you know you'd (inaudible at 0:43:51.8) and you had all these flames (inaudible at 0:43:53.9)-all these flames and the skeleton and all that stuff. </p> Yeah, it was really something else. It was really-Oh God. And then he showed us-he showed us his impression of heaven. And the glorious clouds and music. And, Mary standing up there. Oh it was-it was really really (inaudible at 0:44:13.4). You were sitting there crying and caring. You know but I mean at that age, anything that's something like that, wow. </p> I do. I'm convinced of it really. </p> Yeah. (laughs)</p> Yeah right. It-yeah right. And I feel-unless of course-and then going back, and it really sounds silly. And I know it sounds silly. But you know if I just (inaudible at 0:44:49.6) get away from it and then, just kind of let the whole thing-never have another homosexual relationship, with anybody. And confess everything that I had done. And then, everything would be fine. And end up in heaven again. </p> Right. </p> Right, right. Yeah, that's it. That's what [we were] (ph) taught. (inaudible at 0:45:11.0) Cleansed. (inaudible at 0:45:14.3). </p> No no. I don't. </p> I was at up my parents' house and (inaudible at 0:45:24.2) came up and he was like, ""Are you going to heaven? Do you think you're going to heaven?"" And I said, ""No."" (laughs) You know I think that-God (ph), I shouldn't have said that. If I had been someone who said, ""Well probably. I don't know."" Or something like this. Yeah something like that. I told him really frank, I just said, ""No."" And I thought, ""Oh wow. He must think I'm really crazy."" (inaudible at 0:45:48.5) Then he said, ""Oh would you like to go."" And I said, ""Oh, sure."" (inaudible at 0:45:52.6) something at his church. It was really something else. It was funny. I had to laugh. Though, it was funny. It really broke her up. </p> A fear.</p> A fear.</p> A fear of God, a fear of burning in hell. (inaudible at 0:46:17.0).</p> Yeah. I feel kind of bad. </p> Yeah right. (inaudible at 0:46:29.6) they will come. </p> Oh yeah. </p> Yeah right. I mean (ph) like I said, (inaudible at 0:46:48.2) and things like that. Yeah right. </p> Yeah. (inaudible at 0:47:01.0)</p> Right. And with their own (inaudible at 0:47:07.6), not even married. I'm really, ready to, you know, get married, right. And just to feel like a (inaudible at 0:47:15.6) right. And then you know, I'll take [that chance] (ph) my number, (inaudible at 0:47:19.9).</p> That would really-that would make them feel bad as, living a homosexual way of life.</p> Yeah, yes yes yes. It's not really bad. </p> Yeah right. It did. It's really not that bad at all. But you know. It is sad, words (ph) like sinner, I mean I did confess it. They didn't say something. And I thought to myself, ""Well why didn't they say something."" Why didn't they say, ""Well, do this or do that."" Instead of saying, ""Oh no you shouldn't' do that. Seven 'Hail Marys' and Seven 'Our Fathers' and your sins will be forgiven."" And that point, you really couldn't say you were repenting because you really couldn't say, you weren't going to go and do the same thing again. In order to really repent, you just have to really have it on your mind you aren't going to do that again. And you're never going to do it again. Of course I tried, to-</p> Oh yeah when I was, in high school. No-I wasn't in high school. (inaudible at 0:48:48.0). Yeah. Oh-well when I was in high school, it was masturbation and things like that. And that was a 'no' too. Don't do that either. </p> Yeah right.</p> Yeah right. You know they said, ""No."" It was something wrong. And pray to the Blessed Mary for, guidance and that stuff. (inaudible at 0:49:14.8) That was, really kind of rotten when you think about it. You know they just have an opportunity to really help people and don't, even- and yet (inaudible at 0:49:29.1) nothing goes further. </p> Yeah.</p> What I do.</p> Yeah right. </p> Yeah right.</p> That right. I wouldn't have been there, if I didn't feel bad about-I would never have said anything if I didn't feel bad about it. And-they'd know it. So why didn't they do anything about it. I don't know. Yeah that's - . (inaudible at 0:49:55.4) They tell you all these 'don'ts' but when you do it they don't tell you how not to. </p> Yeah. Tell you you're bad. No. But you'll be good after you say these two prayers. (inaudible at 0:50:11.2).</p> Never lied to myself and say, ""Oh God.""</p> No-yeah, I don't think anybody did to tell you the truth. I find it very very [hard to believe] (ph). </p> No I can't. Now I often wonder, (inaudible at 0:50:58.0) think I'm pretty-the ultimate, that had been brought up in the Catholic religion. (inaudible at 0:51:03.5) How do they find their way around heterosexual relationships. It's beyond me. But everybody's different. That's the thing. </p> Yeah right. That's it. That's it. Can't find your way.</p> No. </p> No. I wouldn't do-well. Yeah there's a sense of hopelessness but there's still hope. Because as long as I, you know, as I keep on trying, maybe. </p> Kind of (inaudible at 0:51:57.7) right. (inaudible at 0:51:59.3). </p> Yeah but that's a different-that's a whole different thing. </p> Yeah right. (inaudible at 0:52:12.6). </p> Yeah that's true. That's true. Maybe, (inaudible at 0:52:24.5). </p> Yeah. And I thought that maybe, if I were to take the initiative, I'd still wouldn't take the initiative to someone who I didn't feel committed to, a commitment to. Even I would take the initiative. </p> That, and the feeling that, ""Okay if I did take the initiative, this person might feel that I am feeling committed. That I am committing myself at that point too.""</p> Yeah right. You said, ""Okay. Okay you don't know [if you] (ph) could get married to something like this."" And you know, I said I don't feel that I could put myself in that type of a situation, at the place where I am now. The sexual thing I have now, I couldn't put myself into that kind of position. For this person's sake, and my sake. For that matter I couldn't.</p> Right. Yeah. I want to make sure. Marriage is a-a life thing for me. It's not really-I think that's it's really-that's it. Of course someone was talking about this concept where they (inaudible at 10:53:19.0). And kind of an agreement with that also. Not-not because of sex. Sex within (ph) a marriage, but-</p> I said to them, ""And if you were married and you're going to stay (ph) up to five years, you don't think you could live with this person. You just say, ""Okay."" (inaudible at 0:54:26.3) There isn't really a big divorce or anything. You just don't sign the next contract. But, I just think that-I think I'm kind of in agreement with that. Not just because of sex, because of the situation that I'm in. But I think it's very difficult for any two people to live with one another. And, if you've signed that is going to-(inaudible at 0:54:51.1) for five years. You really stand a chance of doing it. It's really, kind of hard to get out of it. That's why I'd be in kind of agreement with that. But it's still a big commitment, especially when you (inaudible at 0:55:02.9) and things like that. </p> Yeah. That's true. Not-a kind of life that's, good. A life that's sharing things and doing things, just together a lot. </p> Yeah that's right. Just, talking, you know stuff like that. It's kind of life that I lived, with all this really crud-you know this is it. </p> God, yeah right. It's always, well, you're going to get married and have kids some day. And the whole society is geared toward that life. All of society is geared toward that life today. It's like they look down on someone who isn't. </p> Especially a girl, my God. </p> Yeah I would. Yeah. That's it.</p> Oh yeah right. </p> Yeah right. Right. </p> Being in this one or the next one too. Sounds like a big deal.</p> Okay. </p> Okay times yeah. </p> Right, right. So...</p>",1

As in like I won't be thinking about it and then somebody will like ask me and I'm like oh fuck.</p> But it doesn't seem to have been very bad because you know, I left and went to work, but like I thought I was going to have a blister there.</p> You know. Yeah, there's this whole thing with like, if it looks, if it seems like I'm having a bad day, that makes, that means my customers don't have a good day or you know. I guess it's just like throwing in to sharp relief, the ways in which I work anyway of you know, if I am having a bad day then that brings down the people I care about and so like I just try not to. Then I'll be starting at 11:30 (ph) tomorrow. I really would like to be with her and like at a huge party and I didn't. [00:04:50]</p> I think like eight or something or ten.</p> Yeah and I'm not looking forward to it and I have to clean it which is also kind of shitty. I'm not looking forward to it, but—. I just want it to be over, but it's not going to be over until I do that. [00:05:50]</p> Whether, you know, it's like remarkably like every other choice of job that I've had. (laughter) You either burn out fast or you find some way to do less than you can be doing in each moment and be okay with that. Or be okay with the fact that even if you are working flat out the entire time you are there, you're not going to get everything done. You're not going to get everybody's order on time. You're not going to have everything clean all the time, etc., and that's hard for me. [00:07:50]</p> Yeah. Yeah. But, everyone higher than you will tell you that you ought to be able to get enough done.</p> Get everything done. Yeah. You know, so the store manager is telling us that we ought to be able to do all of these things and, you know, be on top of everything. Brew a hot pot of coffee every eight minutes.</p> God. These beepers go off when it's time to brew coffee. Every eight minutes all day and when you're working the register, you're supposed to also be brewing the coffee, but you can't do it because there's people in line all day.</p> All day. I mean—</p> There's like a maybe an hour or two in the early afternoon when you have a little bit of down time, maybe. And then sometimes like there's a floater and you're supposed to be like filling orders for you and bringing coffee and stuff, but like you just can't do it and they just, the fucking beeper just drives me insane.</p> So she's working all this fucking unpaid overtime which I think, you know, it's not my business to tell her don't do that. Like, it's like adjuncting. It just plays in to the system, but—yeah, it just like breaks my heart. [00:10:05]</p> Yesterday I was reading the, a description of the mother in this book. It's talking about the style of parenting that's like, you know, lavishing affection and very loving and refuses to believe that your child could lie or, you know, or could do any of these bad things and is clearly working really, really hard to show the child that the child is loved and ends up with, you know, and all of her kids grow up hating themselves, (laughter) and yeah, that, that feels like my mom. [00:12:40]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> That makes sense. Thanks.</p> Although, when you put it like that, I'm not sure that is not happening with my mother. His descriptions of depression are pretty good also. Not—you know, I think he draws lines where there are spectra, stuff like that, but—. [00:19:25]</p> Okay. Just wondering. You know, next time you have like a hundred hours to spare. (laughter)</p> Because I think you would like it. Although, now I can't think of any specific reason, but I think you would like it. I just think you would. So, you know, maybe you should read it because I like it. (laughter)</p> Yeah, I know.</p> Yeah. And I don't think maybe you shouldn't read it. I, I just tend to—interesting. So, I, I sort of like to talk about books, but I only really like to talk about books with some people. So, I guess I'm worried that you wouldn't be somebody that I wouldn't like to talk about books with. Interesting.</p> I feel bad saying that, but, you know, basically I like to talk books, about book with Amanda.</p> Yeah and that's about it. I'm just good at them.</p> Oh, yeah. [00:22:45]</p> Yeah.</p> —that I would be a bit color blind somehow and that then you'd be disappointed and feel guilty?</p> Something like that. Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah. You know, it feels like I, I get trapped in to expecting things out of people that it's not reasonable for them to be able to do and yes, that does apply pretty broadly also. (laughter) I'm thinking that this is more or less like minor thing or a harmless thing. [00:23:50]</p> Why would they do that?</p> Yeah.</p> Prefer that to the guilt of blaming other people?</p> Well, nothing comes to mind. [00:27:00]</p> Yeah, like I'm, like I'm trying to hit bottom at some point or hit something solid, but, yeah. I didn't go to church on Sunday. I was tired. I had stuff to do, so I just stayed home. You know, then the last couple of weeks have been painful in one way or another. I don't think I'm really that happy there which is too bad.</p> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That whole thing is we don't share. That's very important to me and Jessup. You know, and he is glad that it's a good place for me, but I think doesn't understand why and—. Or yeah, doesn't, he can't quite wrap his head around it and so that makes me worried.</p> He doesn't—he tends to pay a lot more attention to the sermons than I do which I guess I kind of. That's the part of the service where the priest stands up and kind of speaks for that community or speaks to that community and for that community. He's kind of representing that community. And, you know, I grew up listening to papa preach and knowing that he had woken up at 6:30 in the morning to write that sermon. Or like having had him like run ideas by me and like tweaked it with him or just not listening, because you know, kids. I, you know like, Amanda or my siblings and I, like we would go to church alone. Like we wouldn't have anybody to sit with, but like sometimes we'd sit with friends, but we kind of preferred to sit alone because then you didn't have to pay.</p> Yeah, it's good. Always late to church. Every single day, year, week. But, you know, so I guess I'm more used to the idea that like the ceremony is just is not actually that important. If it's good, that's awesome. That's something really special. That's a gift, but there are, there are not that many good preachers out there and I don't, yeah, and so—. And James also doesn't, doesn't have the same sense of kind of—. The liturgy is not important to him. [00:31:42]</p> It's just. You know.</p> It kind of—it's sort of like, like a Pentecostal service. So, like speaking in tongue.</p> Like, shit like that. Which I—</p> He's kind of cult actually. It actually was classified as a cult in the 70's but I don't think it is anymore. It's called The International which is like hilarious. Like seriously? (laughter) You know, basically people who, founded by some people who were, felt really alienated by the churches that they grew up in and tried to like basically redo the reformation and like go back to the text and like study the real text without, you know, anybody getting in the way. And they did some good things and then kind of got stuck and, you know. So, now it's like they know three words of Greek and so it's hard for me to take them seriously because like come on dudes.</p> Like, there is this whole field called physical scholarship that like does linguistic studies. Like there's stuff you could, like there's other stuff.</p> Yeah. Yeah. And once you actually do it then you start to realize that there are problems inherent going back to the text, but there is no more text. So, yeah, so I have a hard time not being disdainful of a group that was actually very, very important to the whole family, to their way of thinking. You know, his parents were basically religious leaders within that community, and are really wise and good people and so I've got to respect that. But at the same time when they start talking about like what they actually believe, I'm like, this is, let's talk about something else now. (laughter) [00:34:40]</p> When I really, I, I find the liturgy very, very important and powerful and it—yeah. Like being at church in a church service worshipping with other people is what it's about for me.</p> Yeah, yeah, yeah. But— [00:37:07]</p> No, you didn't say anything.</p> You really didn't.</p> You kind of said something like ""oh, I don't really know anything about that"".</p> I think just like religion in general. It might have been Christianity, but I think it was just religion in general.</p> Yeah, I don't know. But, there's also like, so there is that and then there is this, I—. Like, I feel like religion and psychology are both completely inseparable and really probably shouldn't mix that much. [00:38:08]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> Well, there just aren't that many people who are—. There just aren't that many people who could can both keep up with me intellectually and are okay with the things that I'm thinking and believing.</p> Right. Why do I want to?</p> I'm very lonely. I, in that I feel like the any question of God is, you know, my relationship with God is pretty central to my life. Pretty, pretty much the thing that is going on or one of the, the big things, but it's like nobody else is speaking the some language as you or nobody else that I actually meet and talk to and so I, but then also I—</p> It's not like whether there is a God. That doesn't, that's not very important. It's more like where is God in my life? Or is God in my life? But—.</p> But everybody who seems to find that question important and feel like they have an answer or feel like they know God to be in their lives in an important way. Yeah. I know they can't keep up or they're not interested in talking to me. It's probably not true, but it's what it seems like.</p> Yeah. Although I'm sure, you know, I know much of that is I don't know how to ask, but not all of it. You know. Intellectual giants don't really go in to the priesthood. They go in to academic theology I mean as a general rule. Which is, I can't believe that just came out of my mouth, but it did, so, oh well. Or they don't tend, maybe they go in to the priesthood, but they don't go in to ministry.</p> No, they, they do. It's just that—</p> No, they do. They write about it. It's just like they're not going to sit down with you and talk.</p> You know.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Well, I'm not a theologian, so they're also not going to talk to me in the same way.</p> Thanks</p>",2
1004564997.txt,"What's that?</p> Great.</p> Um, [clucks] well, I started a blog again.</p> Um, yeah, I think it'll be good. I blogged — I had a blog of some kind, basically, from my start of college through...</p> ...To pretty recently, actually, um, like maybe eight months ago.</p> Um, various, different kind of formats and places (ph), things I was talking about.</p> [Clucks] I had stopped because of, like, ""OK, I'm a grown-up now. I'm getting into the academics. I really can't have this much of a public Internet presence."" So I stopped my personal blog, and I had had a — started a blog with a friend that was going to be kind of more anonymous but talking more about our work. Um, she was a woman I roomed with my second year. Her name's Candace. I've probably talked about her. One of my best friends. [00:01:11]</p> She's a — uh, I guess I haven't talked about her much, but she's a — um, she teaches ...</p> ...At a private school, um, and so, basically, we — when we lived together, you know, she would come home and tell me about, like, you know, Archbishop Romero and social justice, and I would come home, and I would tell her about, like, laws about canal-digging in ancient Mesopotamia.</p> And that was something that was fun, and I thought we were kind of — like, we missed that and wanted to kind of get that up again. But it didn't really take off because we both developed really serious health crises at the same time. [Chuckles]</p> So I was hospitalized for depression...</p> ...And she got something that's not rheumatoid arthritis but is pretty similar.</p> You know, like, woke up one day, and her legs were so swollen that she couldn't get out of bed.</p> Like, I was actually there the weekend that she first had to go to the hospital for abdominal (ph) pain, and it was, like, [slaps surface] — so, basically, we dropped that.</p> Um, also, she's not — she's just not as into it as I am. I think she doesn't have the same — she doesn't have confidence in her own writing, so she's not — she never really feels like people will want to read what she writes...</p> ...And I kind of don't care. [Chuckles]</p> I'm, like, ""You don't have to read it."" [Chuckles]</p> Um, so, I'm writing again, which is good. Um, it is going to be a private blog, so — because I want to be able to talk about what I really want to talk about.</p> But, nominally, it is about the things that I knit, and so — so [chuckles]...</p> {Sniffles]...There'll be a lot of that. [00:03:01]</p> Yeah, I think it is kind of a — I don't know — way to get myself back out into the world and back out into the things I like to do.</p> So...</p> Yeah, yeah. It has been a long time since I've really wanted to...</p> ...Write again, and kind of been confident enough to write again.</p> Um, yeah. And, I mean, still, like, there's a lot of days I feel like I just don't have anything to say. Um, so [trailing off] we'll see how this goes. [Pauses] Um, yeah. And I know I just don't keep a personal journal, but, for some reason, I like blogging much better.</p> Um, it is easier for me to think when I type, when — instead of when I write things by hand at this point... [00:04:00]</p> ...Which I never thought would happen, but it did, um...</p> ...And I find it easier to write when I have an audience in mind.</p> Um, like, I know. [Pauses] Yeah, it is a pretty self-indulgent thing, but nobody has to read it if they don't want to, so, you know, I'm OK with that. And, you know, James and Amanda and Candace really like reading my writing, so that's good enough.</p> I invited my mom to read it, which was a really big step because I did not tell her that I had a blog before...</p> ...Ever. [Chuckles]</p> So...</p> [Chuckles] I'm feeling very virtuous today. [Chuckles] [00:05:00]</p> Thank you. Um, it was just funny because I was — I was so angry at myself all yesterday. Um, like I — I mean, I was just so angry at myself. Um, [pauses]...</p> Um, I think mostly the thing with Franco and Sascha, and that kind of spiraled.</p> Um, and — and I — I didn't do very much yesterday. You know, I did end up applying for a job, eventually, but I — after my appointment with you yesterday, I basically went straight home and got back into my pajamas, and got into bed, and just... [chuckles] [00:06:06]</p> I was just like, ""This is all I want to do right now."" [Chuckles]</p> [Shifts in seat] Um, so, I — yeah. [Pauses for seven seconds] You know, it wasn't like a crying sort of day; it was more like a staring-into-space sort of day. Um, [pauses] but this morning's going pretty well so far. I've got my tea (ph).</p> [Sighs] [clucks] I think it is just the talking about them, and that I feel so helpless, and that I feel helpless but I feel as though I should not be helpless, that, you know, [shifts in seat] I just [pauses] — I can't not think that this is all my fault that my life is this way right now, that I feel this way right now, um, and that, you know, I've had to kind of completely reorder my life because I can't do the things that I want to, really.</p> Um — [exhales], [pauses for ten seconds] yeah, I mean, you know, we kind of talked through the whole situation yesterday, and that the reasonable conclusion was, ""Yes, like, that wasn't my fault,"" [chuckles] and yet [chuckles], in my mind, it is always my fault.</p> Or, at least, I should be able to fix it. Um, [pauses for five seconds] yeah, and then [sighs] having said, ""OK, I'm not going to hurt myself anymore,"" um, then it was a real struggle because, eh, hurting myself helps me deal with being angry at myself, helps me get that out, and it doesn't — but [sighs] so it is kind of a test of will, sort of — you know, can I just deal with being this angry at myself, you know, kind of just there. [00:09:18]</p> Um, and I did, which is good. Um, but [pauses for five seconds] my roommate has a friend staying for the week - um, two of them I know from school, also. Um, and — and, frankly, with — but it has been this weird — sort of weird situation that, like, Kirsten just got out of the hospital...</p> ...Is still, I think, really worried about her health. Um, and I think, more than that, like, this was the first time that she has been hospitalized, and so it was really dealing with, like — I think she's having real trouble with kind of the loss of dignity that comes with hospitalization. [00:10:04]</p> Um, and, in some ways, I was, like, ""Oh, God, I know exactly what you mean."" You know, like, ""The first thing you do when you go into a psych ward is you have to take all your clothes off; like, that's the first thing that happens."" [Chuckles] Like, what — I didn't see that coming. [Chuckles]</p> [Chuckles] Um....</p> ...And so I was kind of like, I — I want to say, ""Yeah, I understand that."" But Kirsten's not close enough to me to be able to kind of let down that dignity in front of me...</p> ...So I can't really be there for her.</p> Um, you know, and she's — she and I haven't really been talking much recently, and Casey, her friend, is really, really shy, and so...</p> ...When I'm around shy people, I become really, really shy, and so the conversation is always kind of awkward.</p> And so it is like we've been like two camps kind of avoiding each other... [00:11:04]</p> ...But being really nice to each other, but also kind of...</p> ...Not acknowledging the fact that we're avoiding each other.</p> Um, yeah, yeah. And it is like a — I really want — I want to help Kirsten with what she's going through now, because I think she's really scared. Um, but, A, I'm not letting her help me with what I'm going through; B, I'm not up for putting myself out there much for people, um, and, you know — you know, I offer and just say, ""Anything you need, I will do,"" and that's all I can do.</p> I'm a little — a little relieved that she [speaks softly] hasn't taken me up on it. [Chuckles]</p> Um, yeah, but so I kind of go home and hide in my room, and [sighs] [pauses] I don't know. [Sighs] But I — half the time, I think that all of these things that I'm doing to kind of — to make myself — that are things that are good for me — you know, I'm doing it [slaps surface]: keeping a reading group with some of the students in my department; and have to keep up with my language skills and also keep in touch with them over the summer, um, because, otherwise, I'm going to lose touch entirely...</p> Um, and, you know, starting a blog and, like, learning how to sew, and these projects that, half the time, I think that they are actually going to be good for me...</p> ...And about half the time, I think, ""Well, I don't think any of this is going to help at all. I don't think any of it is helping at all. I don't think anything I'm doing is helping me at all, but I don't really know what to do other than pretend that I believe that this will help."" Um, [slaps surface] So here I am. [00:13:10]</p> [Shifts in seat]</p> I did look up — I did [chuckles] look up suicide on Wikipedia and kind of scrolled through, and that was actually a good thing, um, because I came to the conclusion that any suicide method that I could be sure would work [shifts in seat] — I mean, reading some of the statistics, like, people have slit their wrists; that doesn't work! [Chuckles] They end up in the hospital; they don't end up dead. [Chuckles]</p> So, um, the only thing that I could be sure that would work, and that wouldn't be too horrible for everybody else around me would require several days' preparation.</p> So that's good.</p> I can kind of take that off the table...</p> ...In that I — I — you know, I'm — it is like part of my commitment in being married to James is to be with him. Um, you know, I'm committed to that, um, so what has been scaring me is the — the thought that — you know, the specific mood I am in will precipitate something.</p> Um, but...</p> Yeah, but, now, I know that it seems like the things that people do impulsively don't actually work very well, so... [00:15:04]</p> ...That will help. [Chuckles]</p> [Chuckles] Um, I told James this. He also was reassured, eventually. [Chuckles]</p> Eventually. [Chuckles]</p> Um, [pauses for six seconds] but [pauses for five seconds] — so then a lot of time, I think, ""Well, I guess this is my life now,"" [pauses] and that's hard.</p> But I'm easily distractible, for a while anyway. You know, good things happen.</p> And I just have to try to hold onto them.</p> Yeah, that seems like it. I try not to think about them when I'm not in a bad mood. Um, [pauses] but, you know, it seems counterproductive, um, to kind of seek out all the bad things in my life when they're not directly in front of me.</p> Um, [pauses] but, yeah, I mean, I really have just kind of been — kind of going from one thought to the next, and it really has been kind of [chuckles] going downhill. [Chuckles]</p> Um, [chuckles] so I don't know what to say about that. [Chuckles] [00:18:56]</p> [Chuckles] [sniffles] That's a — strangely reassuring. [Chuckles]</p> You know, the drawback of having a private blog is that — that I know who's reading it. Um, I actually don't like that very much. [00:20:00]</p> Um, [pauses for 10 seconds] I guess I don't want [exhales] people to read what I write in order to indulge me. You know? The hope is that it is something that they like; if it is not, I'd rather them not read it.</p> You know? Yeah. Um, because, at the same time, it is there as much as for me; I mean, I'm writing something that I like.</p> Um, and I don't — I'm pretty OK if — I mean, not that many people are into knitting; it is just a fact. [Chuckles]</p> Um, [chuckles] more than you would think, but not that many. [00:21:07]</p> Also, a lot of the people who are into it are, like, scary into it and...</p> ...And a few kind of back out of that community.</p> Um, [pauses for 15 seconds] yeah, I don't know where I would go with that.</p> I'm thinking.</p> Part of me is thinking, like, more like things to talk about. I mean, really, I — I'm trying to come up with a thought that is coherent enough to be a sentence.</p> Yeah.</p> Uh, [contemplating] yeah.</p> I mean, I feel pretty comfortable just saying, like, the what-comes-to-mind-thing...</p> ...Um, but I — I think I — [pauses] I don't know — maybe I shut things off before they get into sentence form, if I don't think they're going to be useful.</p> Um — uh, I drive James nuts, and he's driving me nuts... [00:23:03]</p> ...Because they way I have a conversation, is I figure out what I'm going to say as I'm saying it. Like, by talking, I am forming my argument.</p> The way James has a conversation is...</p> ...Is he sits down and he's silent, and he forms what he's going to say, and then he comes out with it, meaning that I have had to learn to be patient with very long silences in conversation. But it is not easy for me. [Chuckles]</p> Um, and he has had to learn to be patient with me saying one thing and then saying, ""Actually, no, I don't mean that at all."" [Chuckles]</p> The things that come out of my mouth — I realize, ""No, that's not OK.""</p> ""That's not what I wanted to say.""</p> I'm kind of revising as I go. [Shifts in seat] Um, strangely enough, very similar to the way we write... [00:24:01]</p> ...In that I write more fluently and then revise more, and..</p> ...By the time he writes a first draft, it is a pretty good first draft.</p> I'm a better writer than he is. [Speaks softly] It is just one of those things. But I, eh, [pauses] I mean, I'm also — have come to believe that the writing fluently and then revising is actually a more effective way to write for almost anybody.</p> But I know a lot of people that don't agree with me because [won't my mom] (ph) write like that? [My God] (ph).</p> There was a day when I realized that both Candace and Kirsten — this is — we were in our second year, and I learned that neither of them ever revises papers, or revised papers. And I was [emphasizes the word] furious with them, [chuckles] just saying, ""What?! How do you live?"" [Chuckles] Like, ""You're in a master's program!"" [Chuckles] Um, [exhales in exasperation] ah — so, of course, I tried to convince them that their lives would be much easier if they would revise their papers... [00:25:19]</p> ...And that their writing would be better. Because I'd been listening to both of them bitch about how they weren't good writers, for the last year...</p> [Chuckles] But — ""Well, there are things you can do about this."" [Chuckles] Um, [chuckles]...</p> [Chuckles]</p> I'm like, ""You could tie them!"" [Chuckles]</p> Um, [pauses] yeah, yeah. For Candace, at least, I think that it was she's so terrified that everything she's written is terrible, that when she's written it down, she can't — she cannot look at it again. [00:26:04]</p> But that means she doesn't even proofread! Like, she proofreads each sentence as she goes.</p> And then she has to proofread — Ah! [exasperated] I'm sorry. [Chuckles]</p> [Chuckles] This is one of the more unreasonable things about me, [chuckles] I think. But, um, that's what I get for teaching English; I have [speaks softly] opinions about them.</p> Um, when Candace — when — I was there when Candace was first hospitalized, and there was, um, this — her gall bladder was inflamed, and I think she ended up having surgery to remove it, um, as part of this thing that is not rheumatoid arthritis but is the...</p> ...One of those weird things that just...</p> ...But just your body shuts down for no apparent reason.</p> Um, so I — I knitted her a gall bladder and sent it to her in the mail. [Chuckles]</p> [Chuckles] It may be my favorite thing I've ever made. [Chuckles]</p> It had a mustache on it.</p> [Chuckles]</p> Yeah, she did. She loved it.</p> It was a little bigger than actual size, but, otherwise, pretty anatomically accurate.</p> Um... [00:28:00]</p> That's true. [Chuckles] Yeah [pauses for 12 seconds], my only problem is with liking to make things is that I think — you know, I like to make things for people.</p> I mean, I don't have to give them gifts, but I don't want to give them something that they don't like. And it takes a long time to do, and so [pauses] yeah, I'm...</p> ...Trying to work for other people's tastes as well as my own is hard. [Pauses] But, you know, that's — then I can give them something of myself, [so to speak] (ph). [00:29:05]</p> And it helps keep me going a lot.</p> I've knitted a lot [chuckles] in the last year and a half.</p> Um, [pauses for 17 seconds]</p> [Chuckles]</p> Yeah, that's kind of a side note.</p> [Chuckles] Um, yeah, I mean, I have — it is — I am kind of trying — yeah, trying to figure out what you think is more useful to talk about, um, as well as trying to bring up what I think is going to be more useful to talk about. Um, [pauses] yeah, I mean, you know, like I said, I like plans. I — eh — [chuckles] I find free association a difficult concept.</p> You were, like, I'm actually really onboard with it; it is just difficult for me, personally. [00:31:00]</p> Um, [pauses] so, you know, yeah, I did ask, trying to free-associate. [Chuckles]</p> [Chuckles]</p> Um, [pauses for 10 second] yeah, I mean, [exhales] you know, I trust that you know what you're doing. Um, but I also recognize that a huge portion of knowing what you're doing is realizing that you don't actually know what you're doing. [Chuckles] So [chuckles], um, [pauses for 14 seconds] yeah, and there's always the kind of impulse for me to, like... [00:32:08]</p> ...Try to present a picture of myself that you will like. And, like, [slaps surface] that's the way I deal with people; like, I just really want people to like me.</p> Really want people to like me. Um, [shifts in seat] and so that's something that is definitely also at play, that I'm very much aware of and very much, like, kind of trying to be real as it happens.</p> Was — was [drops arms] it a success? [Chuckles]</p> So I don't know to what extent I'm kind of curating what I say...</p> ...In order to try to say things that will make you like me.</p> Um, [sighs] it — it is so engrained that I kind of can't tell.</p> Um, [pauses] but I also, I mean, have a habit of honesty, as well, with most people.</p> Um, you know, so...</p> ...If I can't say anything that they will like to hear, I usually just keep my mouth shut.</p> Yeah, because my first impulse is always to sell myself out and just be whoever the person wants me to be, um, and that hasn't worked well for me in the past... [00:34:07]</p> ...And I don't want to be that person. So, yeah, I work on it. Um, [pauses] yeah. [Pauses] You know, like, when I'm — my first year in college when...</p> ...[As bad as I] (ph) was willing to have a whole lot of friends, and it — and that happened, and I had a whole lot of friends, and I realized that I wasn't really being myself; I wasn't saying what I thought. I was...</p> ...Responding to what they wanted me to be, and...</p> ...As a result, I was becoming somebody that I didn't like very much. Um, you know, so I took [full credit] (ph) I was about to — shortly after I broke up with Bryan, because, you know, I modeled so much of who I was into what he was with OK with me being and what he wanted me to be. [00:35:09]</p> You know, we were together in the first place because we shared a lot of things that were really important to us, you know, because we both loved plays and literature, and art, um, and ideas, and we both loved conversations. Um, you know, eh, my high school — my — in my senior year, we were in an English class together, um, with probably the best teacher I had all during high school.</p> Um, and we walked in one day, and we were arguing, like, vociferously about something, and he just said, ""Ah! Here come the Bickersons.""</p> Um, and I took that as a huge compliment. [Chuckles] Um, but the fact was, like, I couldn't be [exhales] a lot of the things that I was because that was threatening to Bryan. Um, [pauses] and, in some ways, it wasn't until after I broke up with him that I realized that, ""Oh, I can stretch out now."" [00:36:16]</p> Um, but I said, ""I'm not going to do that anymore.""</p> And I try not to.</p> But, at the same time, like, when I got my umbrella back from Franco the day before yesterday, I said, you know, ""I'm OK. Don't worry about me. You know, it is OK,"" because he was clearly concerned about me, and I...</p> ...[Slaps surface] [shifts in seat] So my impulse was — you know, reassure him, ""You don't need to worry about me. You know, take care of your own life; I'm fine.""</p> Which is not true. [Chuckles] [becomes emotional] Um, [pauses] you know, it is true that I can do without [becomes emotional] him right now, but [pauses] that was a case where my impulse to — to be who we wanted me to be was much stronger than — or who I — what — to be what I thought he needed won over what I actually needed. [00:37:21]</p> Um, [clucks] I think this is why the — and my — my mother is the person for whom this is most difficult for me, in that I just cannot — I just can't unwire that — that impulse to kind of like reflect back the daughter that she wants.</p> Um, which isn't fair to anybody. I mean, it is not — it is not good for either of us in the long run. Um — well, I don't know whether it is good for her or not. [Sighs] You know, she keeps trying to have me tell her that I'm angry with her, and I keep saying, ""That's not your — that's — you don't get to dictate that,"" you know. [Chuckles] ""That's what you need; that's not what I need. And maybe it is what I need, but it is not what I'm ready for, and [pauses] you're still trying to coerce me in some ways."" [00:38:31]</p> Or at least - I feel like that, but maybe I'm just bitter. Um, [pauses for nine seconds] I don't even know what it is I'm doing yet until the conversation's over, and then it is like...</p> ...I wake up and I go, ""That's not who I am."" [00:38:58]</p> Uh, not in a way that bothers me. Um, no.</p> Yeah, I — I find you somebody very easy to be who I am with, if that makes sense.</p> Um, and I find it easy to talk about what it is important for me to talk about at that moment.</p> So, I mean, we are getting away from it, but...</p> ...In some sense, I — it is kind of I'm ready to let go of that right now...</p> ...Or [judge what is] (ph) more important to talk about.</p> Uh-huh, thanks.</p> I ended up calling James, and I was just — it was a huge mess.</p> [Shifts in seat] So he told me about an article that he'd read yesterday, about whales having a unique sense organ that allows them to [door closes] the — like, the way that baleen whales feed is just crazy, and people are figuring it out. And then he told me something about whales. I'm reading <i>Moby Dick</i> [slaps surface] right now, so... [Chuckles]</p> Yeah, yeah. And I always thought that they just kind of wandered around with their mouths open, but...</p> ...It is like only in the last couple, three years, they've figured out that they lunge forward... [00:41:05]</p> ...Their jaws open, like, 90 degrees; their lower jaw rotates in three dimensions so that they can take in, like, a huge amount of water...</p> ....And then they filter it out. So...</p> But, like...</p> Yeah, and that — the idea is, when they sense that they're in, like, plankton-rich water.</p> [Exhales] No, I — I forget. I think it is for, like, when the water hits their mouths, that that allows them to kind of [slaps surface] open up their jaws.</p> It is not like — more like a snake's jaw than a human jaw.</p> Whales are awesome. Then we had a long conversation about whether it was acceptable to eat whales, whether it would be acceptable to eat dolphins, monkeys, humans. [Chuckles] He's a little strange. [Chuckles] [00:42:08]</p> [Sniffles] Um, yeah. [Pauses for 15 seconds] Yeah, that was nice. It — that was a conversation in which talking with James really, really helped me...</p> ...Which doesn't happen very often.</p> Um, [shifts in seat] it is not often that talking with people will — can get me out of where I am.</p> Um, but I was able to go to sleep after that, so that's good.</p> Yeah, I'm still borrowing hope, but here I am.</p> Mm.</p> I think we did.</p> I think we scheduled for Friday?</p> Yeah, Friday at 4:30.</p> OK.</p> OK.</p>",0
1004564983.txt,"I don't know. I feel like I've been on this sort of crazy emotional roller coaster for the past 48 hours because yesterday I had the most amazingly great day not because of anything that happened, but I woke up feeling relatively rested. I'm not talking like energetic jumping out of my skin but rested and in moderate amounts of pain but not like anything I couldn't deal with. And it was like the best day ever.</p> Yeah, it was literally the best day I've had in two years. And it's weird because I was trying to explain to people it wasn't anything specific that happened. It wasn't like I was feeling especially (pause) physically above and beyond like elated or this, or that in terms of (pause) the way I was feeling. It was just gone for a while or mostly gone. Like when you're taking pain medicines that are narcotics the lack of pain is a different feeling. [00:01:21]</p> Like it usually has sort of like a...</p> Yeah.</p> It's a different type of lack of pain and also, just like I said, not feeling super hyperactive or anything like that but just feeling like wow it's not that bad. I'm not that sleepy. I'm doing okay which was absolutely fascinating seeing as that I spent most of the weekend sleeping including Friday to Saturday where I spent like 15 hours maybe. So normally when I do that I get more sleepy. So pardon me for just a moment. I just need to make sure this isn't anything. [00:02:18]</p> It'd be a different world. I really had to keep myself from doing things like saying this is the time I want to reorganize my house and all that kind of stuff. It wasn't like I had energy to burn but you still kind of want to take advantage of it. [00:03:02]</p> Yeah. And so it was really nice. And then today I was feeling really, really crummy, and then I walked into the world's biggest disaster trap at work. And so at first I got really, really defensive and I realized that I'm almost always when I am presented with something that something goes wrong, I immediately assume the worst and always backpedaling trying to deal with something. But then I'm like wait a second this isn't my fault. Screw this. Finally I'm like you know what I did nothing to deserve this. And then having to get this resolved and then explaining to my boss that for a while it was simpler. It's very hard to actually get them to believe you at this that it is easier to accept blame and say I'm sorry and just get it over and done with than to actually scramble for the no it's not my fault and let me prove to you why. [00:04:09]</p> Yeah, but maybe I'm just taking it badly like you get a cold snap out of somewhere and you're used to warm weather. It feels a lot colder that kind of thing. But this is more than weather. And so (pause) I am just exhausted from being on this up down, up down kind of thing. And so I don't really know why yesterday things worked out. I haven't had that happen in many, many years and I guess that made me... [00:06:27]</p> Well the thing is it depends on what kind of pain it is because I'm able to bear other things better than others. Somewhere between a seven or eight every day.</p> Five, four, something like that; much, much lower. I mean probably lower than that even. It was enough that I was noticing silly things in terms of that.</p> Things like when I skinned myself in certain places; that kind of stuff. I don't notice bruises when I do that because normally I have so much intense pain that I don't notice little things. Oh, I guess I got a blister walking home; that kind of stuff.</p> Yeah. That kind of stuff. But (pause) it is very difficult for me right now because of trying to stand up for myself, having done things wrong at work in the past and having decided to take the path of least resistance was saying... And quite frankly there's no reason in the world they should've ever believed me anyway so it was just not worth fighting on this. If a customer says you did something that you didn't do and you have done it in the past, therefore, it's easier just to say yeah maybe I promised them more than I could although I didn't. [00:09:19]</p> Like once you screw up at work sometimes it takes a long time to live it down. And having this much doubt cast was very hard. It makes me very bitter and unwilling to stick my neck out for anybody right now because it only comes back to haunt you. [00:10:06]</p> Well I mean but I have done it... Like say I screwed up something in the past something like oh yeah I told a customer that we could do this for them but we cannot.</p> Yeah.</p> Well sometimes I have to track this down. I'm being told oh well your name was on this piece of paper in your handwriting. And I look at this and this isn't my handwriting. At first when I hear your name is on something with your handwriting I'm thinking oh my God I must have flaked out and really said something. Then I look at this, this isn't my handwriting. My name isn't even spelled right in this. You see where I'm coming from? But I just take the benefit of the doubt sometimes. At first and then it became like... It's very hard. [00:11:30]</p> Very much so.</p> Yeah.</p> Because I am wrong almost all the time lately at least...</p> Like when it comes to piddly things like who's in charge of scheduling now or whatever it is, I'm wrong. Who's in charge of this, who is responsible for that, and what drawer we keep something in yeah I'm wrong. When it comes to knowing what can and cannot be done I'm right. But because I've lost my sense of... [00:14:54]</p> Yeah. I feel like if I do not keep vigilant all the time on this kind of stuff that it's coming back to haunt me and that's exhausting. (Pause) It's really exhausting. And this is going to seem like the world's most random thing in the world, (inaudible at 00:15:32) thing like (pause) - Oh God I don't even know how to start this. This has nothing to do with work and it's going to seem like the world's most random thing to bring up. [00:15:43]</p> Or others sometimes either. Like one of the moves I had people were like relax, sit down, everything's going to be fine, we're going to help you move. I still haven't found half the stuff in that move like literally haven't found the stuff. Don't know where it went to at all. You know I feel like... It isn't even just trusting myself. It is trusting everything trusting people, trusting this. I mean I feel like I have to keep records of what's in what box, what's happening. I feel like I'm really just unable to relax anymore because if I don't constantly be checking around me to make sure everything's okay, then it all goes to hell. [00:19:01]</p> I'm making the joke about the OCD because I knew people who were like that. But it's not like that at all. I don't feel like...</p> Yeah.</p> I just feel like right now and sometimes it's just the active of managing the task is helpful. Like I scan in a lot of things that way at least I know that I can find it. But I don't have to keep checking to make sure they're there. I don't feel like... Okay, with my job I do because that could change but that's just because there's an external force that's changing it. I don't have anyone going to my computer and rearranging my files. But (pause) it's constantly like that and I feel like I'm just very unable to cope with the changes that are happening. It isn't just that I'm forgetting. It's also that things are changing and I'm not - either I'm not noticing. But I'm actually really to suspect that I'm being kept out of the loop. Pardon me for a second. I need to make sure this isn't - because I have to go to work tomorrow. [00:22:12]</p> Shows okay but that just told me that a second ago. Why does it keep telling me that? Oh well. But it's like (pause) I feel like I'm really out of the loop on certain things and I've just not noticed. And part of it's the fact that I've been working for Microsoft too long so if someone asks me how something's done I'm like okay I can tell you all the ways it's been done over the years. I have no idea what the current way is to do something. That's part of it.</p> I hate doubting myself. It isn't just the medication though. I know that I'm doubting myself too because of the fact that I have been around people who have gone out of their way to make me feel like I'm insignificant and, therefore, I'm doubt myself. I mean (pause) just being told by - Even from the beginning of meeting my in-laws of the oh just be yourself. Stop being so fake. I am being myself. I'm not being fake. I mean that's just the beginning of the indoctrination of down is up, up is down, and getting all mixed up. [00:25:21]</p> No. No (pause) and I don't like that. I keep hoping that maybe, maybe, maybe I can start repairing, regenerating some of these neurons that I killed when I didn't realize that I wasn't getting the B12 I needed, but I don't know.</p> I'm actually feeling like right now I can. Before I was overwhelmed with too many things. Now I can finally do that. Now May is an insane month for me, but I really feel like if I call now I can talk to somebody in June or July and that would be fine. [00:27:27]</p> And do so at least I have it. There was too much going on all at once. I'm only finally now getting around to doing all the things that were just - and it sounds stupid to say that they were overwhelming, but yeah it was overwhelming for me. To get to the orthodontist was more than I could really handle. That meant that I had to figure out where the hell this one place was (inaudible at 00:28:02). Like I said, is it north, south, east, west? And so it seemed like it was a stupid amount of tasks, but the thing that kills me is that I know other towns or other things like that well enough that it doesn't bother me. I don't know why it's so exhausting right now here, and I think it's maybe because I'm making it to be that way. I don't know. [00:28:29]</p> Yeah. I didn't dare to think that it was going to be like the next day, but I wasn't dreading it either. I don't know. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I had a customer drop me off something that's supposed to help me with my life. They apparently saw me at one point with my cane and all this stuff. I have I kid you not I think it is some sort of psychological reinterpretation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. I'm not really sure if I'm going to burn, or I'm going to have friends over to drink and laugh at it. I don't know. But it has to do with bardo and transitions and how one side give up the ego of my pain and things will be fine. It's like some sort of Jung/pain management/hippie sparkle and Tibetan Book of the Dead book. And they bought it for me and they dropped it off. I don't even know who it is and put my name on it. And it's really kind of disturbing. [00:30:14]</p> Yeah, I know. Like apparently I need to accept this and, therefore, my soul can transition onto the next part of my life. I'm like what the fuck? Please excuse my swearing but I've never seen anything so completely weird and contrived in my life. I mean I understand there's a lot of very vague... It's almost like saying that it's a blender and a vacuum cleaner at the same time. These things are very valid but when you shove everything together it's kind of creepy. It was so bizarre. I don't know why in the world... I mean it's weird because it isn't just me but the kind of relationship we have with the people we teach they have this desire to either fix us or do stuff like that. Occasionally they drop off food which is sometimes okay. I mean it's not all useless stuff, but it's just so strange. [00:31:12]</p> Oh he flew in this weekend.</p> I attempted to bail, but I'm not going to be able to. So they'll be in town. We'll see what happens from then. (Pause) I have a lot of worries and fears about that. Some of them I can control, some of them I can't. Some of them just has to do with the fact that my house is a mess. In my thoughts it's a mess. And some of them have to do with the fact that I am concerned they're going to want to more than I can physically do, or they are hoping that I have figured out what they want to do. And I'm really not good at that because well - whatever is in the city I haven't done it. I'm sure that they're like oh well whatever you want. Whatever it is I haven't done it. But I also don't really know them well enough to be able to suggest too many activities. They're passive enough to say oh we're easy. Don't worry. Just pick something out. Great. [00:37:34]</p> Well I mean we could be just staring at each other. Then there's my personal favorite where I just get so nervous I make an ass out of myself. (Pause) I won't know what to do, therefore, I won't know what to do or say to entertain them properly at least to [inaudible] belief and, therefore, I could be accused later on of being sullen and being standoffish. I've got some scenarios here. [00:39:26]</p> So I don't know whether or not they're just going to leave and do things without me. If I should encourage Mike to go... He wasn't going for anything back then because it was things like yeah you're bleeding and stuff. I'm not leaving you by yourself; that kind of thing. But this time encourage him to go off and do things, try to muddle through it and just keep trying, yet if I'm not feeling well am I going to be criticized for being sullen or whatever. You know it's just a lot to have to deal with. [00:41:22]</p> Yeah. But unfortunately the period of time in which they are there is a period of time where he is not going to be able to visit.</p> Yeah, that's the period of time where he is teaching some massive conference or something so he won't actually be available. He's available right now if I wanted to go see him. So I have to wait and find out if I have some stupid brat children showing up tomorrow and get wore out and take care of them. The children are not brats. I'm sorry. The teacher's a brat. I don't know anything about the children.</p> I will see you Thursday.</p>",1
1004798799.txt,"I apologize. I started having some—a bunch of allergies, so I'm already—it's hard to understand. I'm starting to get the decongestant out, but everything's still very, very cheap. Oh, gosh. I've just been—I am pretty much physically exhausted again. </p> I—we sold our car last week.</p> And therefore—I am running back and forth to do all these errands and stuff, and all that, and I'm just not feeling very well. And just, you know, all this other stuff going on that just has made it extremely tiring, you know? (pause) I—Saturday was just such a complete and total, like—I don't even know how to explain it. It just turned into an overwhelming disaster, so I—I can't even not really do much of the grocery shopping myself or go with my husband to do it. That's sort of like the division of labor here. Like I said, because we just sold the car and we had—ow, ow, ow—we just had a rental for a little bit, temporarily, I wanted to make sure we were really stocked up on the stuff, so I sent him out—into Target. And it was—it was Saturday afternoon and I think that subconsciously the reason why I try not to—I mean, part of it is just physical exhaustion -</p> —but also part of the reason I want to not do it is—I mean, because he doesn't react well in crowds.</p> And instead of kind of trying to spare him from that, I just would rather not have be around him when I have to deal with like around crowds.</p> He's just—and because he was just—there's so many people at the Target on a Saturday night period, it would just drive him crazy and then there's sort of like a communication breakdown based upon that and—it sort of turned into this—I don't know how to explain it. It really could—it could have been worse, but it was definitely not great. And I had mentioned to him that I was trying to—to get a bike, so we could just stop over, and actually try to do this—and I do these things before I come in—before I decide I want to do something I knew I was like feeling overwhelmed, I came out with a compromise, like, ""Why don't you go do this. This is something that you like to do and I'm going to go look at bikes and we can meet back up."" [00:03:22]</p> Yeah.</p> Or at least look at the bike. I mean, I wasn't certain—like -</p> —I don't know that I'm going to get it, I'm looking at this, right? And he'd be like, ""No, I don't want to do that."" And you know what—I already—I knew this was something he didn't really want to look at bikes, so why in the world would I, you know—and I already knew this and I came out with this compromise. And so he looked at this and I was talking to him about this, and he's like, ""Yeah, it's not going to fit in the rental car."" I'm like, ""Well, this and that."" And he said, ""I'm not going to do it."" And I can tell he's getting grumpy about the whole thing and this and that. And</p> —and the fact that I—he really hates it when I call my mom while he's driving, but I wanted to call my mother really quickly and let her know what the prices of bikes were at Target, because she was talking about helping me out by buying a bike for me, blah, blah, blah. The anxiety of that makes him drive faster, and he got pulled over for an exceptionally high speeding ticket, which, of course, made things even worse.</p> Well, apparently there is this area right like near where it goes down to like 20 miles an hour -</p> And he was like 65.</p> Yeah, yeah. So—and blah, blah, blah, and it just—you know, everything started to evolve from there.</p> And finally, I just like—I was really upset.</p> I mean, I really tried to talk this out, because I explained it, like, ""I come—you know, I can tell you're really upset,"" but I also knew this is the last time we're going to have a car, so it's much—it's much larger than the one we have even by far, because it has a backseat, you know. You know, I was trying to get as much stuff, this and that, and I said, ""You weren't even really all that interested in trying to figure out to fit—how we could fit a bike in there, or looking into this kind of thing so we could get a bike—</p> —and this and that. And basically, he talked to me like, ""I'm really trying to do this and that"" and basically he talked like, ""I'm really trying to do all this stuff."" And I even said, ""Hey, I you—I know you really like the new star wars Legos. Why don't you go look at these while I do this and"" -</p> —and this and that, and then he came out with these things, and it just—like it took most of several hours to try and work this whole thing out, because it's like there's so many things going on at this point, but mostly it was the fact that it—he wasn't really in a good mood and every single thing I was doing was making him more upset. You know? And (pause) I was just really, really—got really upset about the whole thing and this and that, and it just took a long time to like get around to having this conversation. </p> But mostly about the fact that, quite frankly, sometimes because he's so upset about so many things, it's not really all that pleasant to want to be around him. You know? Like in public right now, sometimes. Usually I like to be around with him in public because he's the perfect husband in the world, as opposed to—but when he's over in crowds, he just totally shuts down.</p> And you know, I've been really trying to do a lot of things that were independent and all that stuff, but it's just, you know—and part of that was getting a bike. You know, I was calling my mother because—it wasn't like I was calling my mother to gab about something, or like to annoy him, just to gossip and see what like our husbands were doing. I was calling her because I was trying to get her to give me money to buy something. You know? It wasn't like I was doing it to be annoying. I was trying to do it as soon as I left Target. </p> Just in case she said, ""Well, figure it out and buy it."" You know, I don't know. ""I'll drop it off and charge it and we'll see something"" -</p> I don't know. It just evolved from there. Well, thank God—and I didn't tell me mom what really happened -</p> —at all, because she knew that he—we were being pulled over because the phone—or well, the—being pulled over. I'm not driving, mind you.</p> He's driving. [00:07:33]</p> No, I would never do that.</p> And so she explained to Dave that it—if (inaudible) on—on—on—you know, was working on Sunday, that it would be really in my best interest to go and buy a bike, and have it at the house. And she looked at me—and she's tried to tell him,—she's like, ""I'll tell you what. I'll pay for it. Go get a bike, and you know, more or less, take responsibility. You're the one who's going to be like the hero if you do this.""</p> You come home and there's a bike there.</p> And so you get—that would be good.</p> And you know, this and that—and the biggest of why I was really—like I have a lot of concern is because I'm not sure how much I have to modify this (ph)—and you know, all this stuff. But we'll see. And I—but the thing is, is that I had a conversation about the fact that, quite frankly, as much as you're cranky and bitter about these things, look what she did for you. She was pulling you aside and saying—giving you the opportunity—not necessarily for her swooping in to make things better—to make you be the hero.</p> And now he's just been so like—there's the whole thing where he just is there talking about the fact that he has such little contact—you know, has such little contact with his family over the years—</p> —that—for certain things, it seems so—like things that my parents won't—they really don't get out—they really don't talk to him that much, but you have—super invasive and questions that are super-invasive, you know?</p> Like my mom asking, ""You know, are you in an accident,"" and sometimes I've read that, you know, it's been—several days afterwards is when all these aches and pains start, you know, ""How are you feeling?""</p> That's not that invasive. But since his family would never ask -</p> —you know?</p> So, I think his mom still hasn't called him—you know, she called him on her way to vacation, and you know, he said ""You know, when I'm depressed, you should try not to like get on the phone."" Well, she—I guess she's dealt with the situation by never calling again.</p> Or at least until she thinks that maybe we've forgotten about the situation. I don't know. So—so—immature. But I mean, although, he has these realizations that this is not evasive, by most anybody standards -</p> —it's still so instinctual for him to get over—and I mean, I guess it's partially because he's overwhelmed already, or this and that—but you know what, I'm really sick of him making excuses about it. But I think eventually it kind of got us worked out.</p> But it's just been—I feel bad because now he's gotten me—he's gotten me a bike, and I haven't had a chance to use it yet, of course, which is embarrassing, but it's been—but it's only Tuesday and I got it Sunday.</p> And I've gotten home after it's dark every day. But the—the thing is that it—ever since then it's just that—I have been physically completely and totally taxed by what I've had to do to get back and forth from work. </p> Yeah, yeah. Well, he not always. Yes and no, but also like—like—like my dog is here. </p> She goes to day—doggy day care while I'm at work.</p> Mostly because I made arrangements—my landlord did not want an animal -</p> I mean, she's really good, and they said, ""You know what, if she's supervised—you cannot leave her alone.""</p> And so it's an informal thing—officially, on the lease, they said—they never changed it.</p> And they said they would always look the other way as long as she was never left alone by herself.</p> And I like it because I drop her off and she—she's with other dogs</p> She loves it there. So we're separated. But then it becomes like the, ""Ok, so now I have to go out and get—you know, now I'm going back and forth to get her at day care, and going back and forth to work, and walking home.""</p> And last night, I've already started to get—I've had a lot of muscle cramps in general, but actually, I've been getting ones that are—they become so bad -</p> —that they're really—I mean, because it's—I mean, it's physical exertion that I can't do. And so last night was like an all-time low of really badness. And so I don't—I don't know—I am chipper about it now because it was so disturbing last night that I sort like thinking it had to be a dream; it wasn't. But the—you know, it—but it was just so frightening that I worried now about it a little bit, about being able to do this. </p> I don't know.</p> —I mean, I've gotten muscle—I mean, muscle—I mean, muscle spasms—yeah, I think—I have—I have a data point of 1.</p> You know, walking to the doggy day care, going back to the subway, and then doing this and that, you know? And you know, he's alone with such—so it's absolutely silly for him to go to the pond -</p> —you know what I mean?</p> It's just -</p> And it is on my way home.</p> So it's just—I would say I have only a data point of 1, but the data point was so darn scary last night that -</p> Well, (laughs) it was extremely excruciating, last night. And the second time—oh, I can't even believe I'm going to admit to this. It was so bad that—well, I first fell out the bed, and then I evacuated my digestive system.</p> Yeah. Right onto the floor.</p> Yeah.</p> So. [0013:02]</p> I think so.</p> It probably was—well the problem is ok -</p> —so you never absorb—the -</p> —there's huge amounts of things like this. I have to take other things, too, but the electrolytes slowly get absorbed and then I say, ""Nah."" And it becomes—and this is why I actually it really drives me crazy, just—I know we're going to out on a tangent here, where people tell me, ""Oh, there's great new treatment out there for this."" And I say, ""Yeah, there are treatments out here, but it's not just like a one consequence."" You start throwing off all these other things, too.""</p> And—and my doctors here are a little bit more—about the consequences of things, but they're a little bit more flippant about it, whereas my other doctors—I mean, I think it's because I have been treated for a long time.</p> Where my other doctors are like, ""Hey, we're going to sit down. Let's sit down with a piece of paper, we're going to talk about—like we're going to talk about consequences, like side effects. What can you accept? If you—if you can handle this, what can you accept for that? And do you understand that if you do this, that you—it's not like you just say when—you might get cancer. It's just a matter of time until you get cancer, kind of thing.""</p> And that was really eye-opening and made me feel a lot more in control of my treatment process.</p> You know?</p> Whereas, this is, you know, I'm just hurting, told well, ""You know, most people adapt to this better than you do."" And I was like, ""Well, that's great. I'm so glad most people adapt to this better than me.""</p> But I've sort of started thinking that most people just don't complain to their doctors about it as much as me.</p> —they have—like they have—</p> —it's just that—and so I just—we'll see how it goes this week. I may end up having to go like get in to see the doctor. If I get any more muscle spasms, though, the other thing is I don't want to make a big deal about it, because they are the precursor of MS, and the only way, at this point now—I mean, they've done a lot of testing. The only way they can actually test me for MS is a spinal tap.</p> Yes. I have had too many things stuck into my spinal cord already, and I sort of drew the line. That's strange, I know, but like having it—feeling like that way. I've had—I've had lots and lots of epidural injections in my life. Not the kind like you would have a baby, but they put steroids in where there's inflation (ph).</p> And that was such a very difficult part to manage part in my life, that I just also—I don't like having things stuck into my spinal cord. It's painful. It's really painful.</p> You know, they would put me on a lot of—I mean, it was funny because I would go to the doctor, and they would put me on one dose for a whole lot of Valium. And it was just like one dose of it. So suddenly—I had to take it two hours ahead of time—</p> —just so that I wouldn't fight. And I wasn't the first one. I wasn't even the 30th person that week to have to be done that way.</p> Yeah, because it's—they need you to be so pliant, because it's so painful and there's so many—there's a lot to it. </p> And I—I would have never started that round of things if I had known what I was going to get into with that. I would have been like, ""Oh, ok. No thank you."" But it was just like—I was—it was so—it's not like—it's not like I was sticking my head in the sand about not going—how can the doctor get rid of the (ph) muscles cramps, I was simply saying that I need to have—need to have two-weeks worth of DM (ph) before I'm willing to, you know, start having that route.</p> Because I'm just sick and tired of having to trade pieces—I mean, I feel like I'm losing my life one little bit at a time. I just keep trading off pieces of my life. And it's—it makes me feel really hopeless, you know? [00:17:07]</p> Some things I can trade back, like if I want to go for chemo, I won't be so nauseated.</p> But some of them, you don't trade back, you know? Like I—you know, there's certain things like I know I will never get parts of my mind back.</p> Replacement joints. That's metal.</p> You know? So you sort of—and—and there is no point in the future -</p> —in which I'm not going to have -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, it doesn't—you'll never get it back.</p> I don't ever get to go through a metal detector normally at the airport ever again. You know?</p> And that's -</p> I don't get my 30s back. I don't get any of them back.</p> Yeah.</p> So I am trying really hard to—to intellectualize what's going on right now in terms of how this is going to dig us out of debt, not having a car, by taking it—by intellectualizing it in terms of literally looking at it in black and white in terms of the money. And now also trying to do it in terms of if I can walk back and forth enough to lose the weight, then the doctors will decide that I'm actually being compliant. They—they—a lot of the doctors say they won't really help you out until you lose 15 percent of your body weight. It doesn't matter what size—what weight you are.</p> Like help you out in terms of pain medicine or help you out in terms of this or—you know?</p> They're unwilling—it's almost like as a gesture, 15 percent of your body weight, apparently is a gesture in showing that you're interested enough in your own well-being to be able to need help—to get the help that you need for other things, you know? And—which I think is just bullshit. I mean, if I had 100 pounds, that would mean 15 pounds. For me, it means 30 to show that I've actually done that. But it doesn't matter what weight it is, 15 percent apparently is a gesture to show that you're—you're—of enough self-interest in that. Where in the world do they get this idea?</p> So maybe if I can do that, then they will start being more cooperative with me about—and, you know, that's part of the—the walking back and forth thing, too, is you know—and the biking back and forth it's just to show also that I am going to be compliant enough that if I—if they do take a risk on putting me in something, like, you know, a bariatric weight loss something or other, you know, that I'm—I'm—I'm going to be complaint. Or to get me into a—you know—there are pain management trial—</p> —you know, study trials -</p> —to show that I will be compliant about it, you know?</p> There are some really interesting things in which they would do—they would do things—nerve interrupts, you know? Things like that.</p> They—I don't really get it. I went off pain medicine, specifically so that I could show—that I was—that I wasn't just -</p> —so I wouldn't actually have this problem. So now it comes—this becomes another gesture, another gesture. It's like, you know, I have another—I have another really toxic relationship in my life and it's with the medical industry (laughs). And—yeah -</p> —and I've actually explained, because I've talked about this, I don't even hate Big Pharma. </p> People always talk about they hate Big Pharma.</p> I have no—I have no problems at all with them.</p> You know how expensive the stuff is, you know -</p> —I know exactly why it's expensive. You know? But it's mostly because of the fact that I've just gotten pissed off at the gate keepers, you know?</p> So -</p> Yeah, there's a lot of gate keeping here.</p> And the problem is I got spoiled by the Cincinnati medical system. One, because I had innies (ph) and knew most of the people.</p> Two, because I had a doctor that was extremely proactive.</p> Half of his practice is in the SIU, and for years was sports medicine.</p> So he is and diagnostic—diagnostic—diagnosticians and stuff, specifically. But, you know, so his belief is that it's not getting you—getting you back to good enough is a different level of things. He wants—because all the women -half of his patients—you know, being able to walk isn't—isn't good enough.</p> Being able to—being able to be able to do normal activities for a 30-year-old is good enough.</p> So, you know—and that's why he had the conversations with me about like, ""What are you willing to trade off? Are you ok being with nauseas? Are you ok with being this,"" you know? And I really feel like I don't get that kind of feeling.</p> So it's kind of -</p> —it's very—sometimes it feels very powerless. And I feel bad because it's like, I don't know if anybody else other places—part of the reason why I was able to have this treatment was because I was spoiled. Between my husband's colleagues that knew me—literally anybody who was anybody in—in orthopedic surgery knew my husband, and therefore—because he used to actually perform well and do good things. Still like has—like it's weird because like he isn't completely in the field now, but he still has like patents that are currently like progressive. Like they've been filed and progressing -</p> —like some studies that he's worked on.</p> And so, like, you know—so everybody knew when I had to get orthopedic surgery, you know, it was this guy's wife, you know, and things like that.</p> He's biomedical something.</p> But -</p> —but between undergrad and grad -</p> —he did a couple different stints. He did some things in petro chemical, but then he worked as part of the university's what's called Bone Engineering—Bone Engineering Tissue—Bone Tissue Engineering Center. [00:23:05]</p> And so they do all kinds of things with bone. And then when he went to grad school, he started from—went from really, really macro to much more micro stuff.</p> And so—and he was working more as a chemical engineer for the Bone Tissue Engineering Center -</p> —which sounds weird.</p> So they were doing large things like bones and things like—they were literally things like replacing—like—things related to bone replacements. Actually, I know a lot about it because I—I was actually in talking to them, too.</p> I'd give them a bill. I couldn't get hired -</p> —so I did stuff for them tech—technologically-wise. I'd give them a bill and they would pay me and that kind of—you know, that kind of stuff. So I knew a lot about their stuff, because I helped a lot. And so he has—he has several patents, both you know, U.S. and internationally, for this type of foam that what it is, is it's something called BMP, bone-modelable-like protein.</p> It's a foam that's basically for people who are like older or people who have calcification problems. </p> It's used almost to glue the area back together again. </p> It's injected. But it's a combination of—it's a combination of bone metabolic protein, which makes you grow it back.</p> Then at the same time it also has a type of antibiotic in it, because the—the number one reason why they have these problems is you get these thin films where get these little infections -</p> —that never go away. And that's the reason why these things—these little infections keep it ever from healing properly.</p> It's always like that—that—they're called thin films. They're actually like a slippery (inaudible), so it never actually heals. And then the other thing is, is that once they're done—once it's done, it triggers in so you're body actually remetabolizes it and it goes away. So it's literally a system that goes in, and, you know, stays there for several years, and then goes away on its own.</p> So that's a really -</p> —so that's how he used to be like known.</p> But at the same time I understand part of the reason why he didn't want to do it was because the surgeries were so brutal. Like a lot of the stuff before—before they went to clinical trials for humans, almost all entirely was done with cat—rats with (inaudible) defects. And you have never had a day until you have had to put 100 rolls—100 holes into the skulls of rats. Yeah. You can see where now you want to not get into that.</p> Yeah. I mean, that's just—that's just normal. You have to.</p> But it—you never evolve—until you become a director of a place like that, you never evolve out of getting out of having to do that kind of dirty work, ever.</p> It's not even like once you become a principle investigator or once you become a professor, you can get out of it -</p> —you just can't. </p> So everyone knew who I was. You know, and like there were very, very famous people, like—like in the Olympics, the U.S. or—or the big surgeon there -</p> —you know, and—I can't remember the last name. But he knew who I was.</p> Like all of these people did, plus, because I used to skate and because of like a bunch of other stuff—ok, I came to the combination of orthopedics and sports medicine -</p> —I knew lots of people.</p> And now I don't know anybody. And—and the thing is, is that quite frankly, in theory, you're really not supposed to be treated differently because they know you, but at the same time -</p> I'm sorry?</p> Yeah. But at the same time, you know, it's like, it—I felt like, if I—you know, I had these conversations with doctors about stuff, I got a lot better care?</p> You know?</p> I have yet to have eye contact with my doctor when I come up here. They have all turned their backs—and I don't know if you've noticed this, because it's all digital online, they turn their back to you where they're at their computer.</p> So I don't get—I mean, when they examine you, you get eye contact, but the entire time when there's talking to them, you get no eye contact.</p> And that's—I mean, that's not that big of a deal, but that is an indicator -</p> —of removalable of -</p> —you know?</p> Huh.</p> Yeah.</p> Yep.</p> And even then they did—they found that the whole cascade of issues was related to it—</p> —including being warned, ""You'll never be able to go through airport security again"" -</p> —""without it being a giant pain in the ass.""</p> But you know, I really feel like I'm not being treated like a whole person.</p> And (pause) I don't like going—I've met many people who have chronic illnesses -</p> —who really love the attention of going to the doctors.</p> They like being sick. I would do anything not to be sick. I would actually like voluntarily lose a limb if I knew that I would never have to deal with the—at the very least, I would give it up if I knew that I never had an autoimmune-related issue again. I really feel very strongly towards that. And it's not because I hate the doctors, as much as I am just so sick and tired of having to deal with it. It's like a part-time job.</p> It's more than a part-time job. I've been under—like if I spend 40 hours a week -</p> Well, I mean like—so like, for example, you know for—I'm getting muscle cramps here.</p> So I have to—but in the mornings, because I have my—because my thyroid is being attacked by my immune system, I have to take desiccated thyroid, which means I can't take calcium in the morning, which means that I—but if I'm having muscle cramps, I need more calcium. So know I have to figure out sometime between when I get up in the morning and four hours later to get calcium. That kind of battles. Like I've got to—I spend—and I've never calculated, which is interesting, but I—I would say I easily spend 20 hours a week—</p> —managing the ups and downs of making sure I don't screw anything up. </p> That's exhausting.</p> And that's not even talking about the pain. I'm just talking about making sure that I don't have -</p> Yeah. And it's not even like, ""Oh, this is a bad,""—and like—and again, going back to a doctor that I really loved. He explained me to their treatment tests and side effects, but don't drink alcohol. One is you'll get really drunk really fast, and one you'll need a new liver. He's like-yeah, there's—there's a difference. One destroys your liver and one you—you're not going to be able to realize how fast you're getting drunk.</p> Like, the same thing with like don't eat any more calcium. It's not like it's going to, you know, give you problems where you start getting stones in any—in organs that you're not supposed to. Like, because it calcifies and the next thing you know you're gonna—your pancreas does.</p> Yeah. So it's like there are immediate and very real -</p> —serious consequences.</p> And so -</p> —like it's shots. And I'm like, you know—you saw how many shots I took. That's three months of shots, that's a lot.</p> Yeah. I'm just—I'm just sick of it. I don't feel like I'm getting attention from it. It doesn't make me special. I'd like to believe that it's made me into a more patient person -</p> —I—and maybe it's just because I'm trying to find a—a bright side -to it, that it's made me into a better -</p> It sucks.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, it's been really freaking awful. And so, you know, it's (pause) and the worst part is, is that (pause) all I'm doing is slowing down the decay. It's not fixing it.</p> It's—I can—I mean, if I knew I was going to stop any progression, but there'd still be pain, but you know, stopping progression—you know, if I was halting it in its tracks, different story again. I'd be ok with it. But if I let myself sit and think about the fact that right now, as I'm breathing, my immune system is potentially tearing apart some new organ or some new joint in my body, or when it decided to reclaim my nervous system and started taking apart my myelin sheaths—you know, I think that's how you pronounce it, but the point is that -</p> —yeah, do you realize how freakish that is to know that other than breathing, my body is just mutilating itself? </p> It's scary.</p> It's really scary. And -</p> It's really terrifying.</p> Yeah. And this—it's so mysterious—and it's not just like mysterious for me, it's mysterious—once you start getting into this brown mode (ph)—getting more than three autoimmune diseases, it is so cut and dry in terms of—not that they know what's going to be next, but they know the fact that they have not a clue in the world what starts it, they have not clue in the world what makes you into remission -</p> —they can't even just tell you, ""Oh, if you do this, you will go into remission,"" or something. They have no clue. Half of the drugs they—they give you, they don't know why—like I take quinine. [00:32:38]</p> They have no idea why quinine helps the bones from getting too soft. They don't know.</p> It doesn't help the people with like this or that, they don't know. But they know that it helps. </p> So I take the same stuff the people have that like—the people that get like—oh, what's it called -</p> —not scurvy. I do—I think it helps the scurvy thing, too, but it's um the—the disease you get when you from mosquitoes.</p> Malaria. It's one of the anti-malarials.</p> They have no idea why, but they know it's—you know, that's kind of creepy. Half the drugs my husband takes, you know, in terms of that—in terms of things for his brain, they—yes, they don't know the exact mechanisms for them, but they really do understand, like, serotonin-related things or dopamine-related things.</p> Like we have a basic understanding of what's happening. They have no idea what—the mechanisms behind these. But it works.</p> Yeah.</p> —is—it's the anadrol injections I get, the one that—it gets rid of—it's a TNF alpha-blocker. What basically it does is it blocks tremor necrosis factor, which basically means when your body senses cancer or a tumor, it kicks in and stops it from happening. It kills the tumor.</p> —you will get cancer. No matter what you do—</p> —if you stay on it long enough you will get cancer -</p> Yeah, because your body won't—you will get a tumor and your body won't know about it. [00:34:23]</p> And that's the only one that they really have a clue in the world about how it works -</p> —and that's the scary—and I mean, the funny thing about that—actually, although I'm saying it, I'm ok with it. I know that that is a risk that I'm willing to take.</p> You know? Quinine, they know that after awhile you get—start to get vision problems. Again, they don't know why you start to get vision problems -</p> —afterwards, but they know that—that's a risk I'm willing to take, again. It's still like all of these drugs have all of these things and they don't really know most of them, and it's just—it's just so freaking serious and it's—I think it—I think it would be much better with being sick like this -</p> —if I didn't have the med—and this sounds really stupid to say this—but didn't have the mental capacity and the desire to understand things as much as I do. If I were less than intelligent, I think I could be better at peace with this.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, exactly. And, you know—and—it's—it's—it's—it's not even just the fear as much as like the fact that—I guess the problem is that if—you know, when I try to understand more of this and I actually try to be really involved in this -</p> —being brushed off and being told, you know, things like, ""Oh, don't worry, I don't (ph) understand also."" [00:36:25]</p> I'm like, ""Try me."" You know, yes, my degree is—you know, my husband actually does this. He pulls this, ""I am—you know, I have a Ph.D. in this and I used to teach, like, physiology. Try me on—try me on trying to describe what a carbamate formation (ph)""—they found a new problem with his brain.</p> Yeah. You know, ""Try me on telling me what this carbamate formation is. I used teach, you know, anatomy and—and—and physiology, so I'm sure they'll understand it."" And sometimes they actually help him.</p> But you know, with me, it's like my background is science and I don't have enough credibility -</p> —you know, except for the fact that I should understand everything that I own in my life -</p> —including my body. [00:37:07]</p> You know, I don't believe anybody else should. I don't have like these beliefs that everybody should understand like, you know, how their air conditioner works. It's just who I am.</p> I don't know. (pause) It's just really frustrating, you know? I don't want to be talked to like a peer, like I'm a colleague, but I'd like to be at least talked to as an educated consumer.</p> You know? And it's—you know, like for example—and I think I briefly just said something to you—in which I got forwarded something—a journal article about how inflammation can also—the pathways for inflammation can also mimic depression. Did I send that to you? </p> Ok. Well, I'll send this to you, this is really neat.</p> Apparently, like this—this thing where like the inflammation pathways light up the same—they were doing these things where I guess some—some particular type of brain scan where it lights up like the same parts—parts of the brain -</p> —as certain things related to depression.</p> And the—the—the concept is that they were proposing that evolutionarily, the reason why that was is if you had so much inflammation, they wanted you to pull back and pull away and not be so active. Therefore, like—it was almost like an evolutionary thing -</p> —like that's our—if you're that hurt, that you're that—that much inflammation, then you really should start withdrawing from the social things -</p> —to heal.</p> Yeah. </p> Just like flu is supposed to make you tired because you need sleep.</p> But it was really interesting. And, you know, I thought that was interesting because—and I will send it to you—</p> —because it's fascinating, but it is an interesting -</p> —and I don't necessarily believe that I'm depressed now because of the fact that I'm not inflamed, but it is an interesting -</p> —I think there's a few thousand other things that's doing that, too, but knowing that mechanism -</p> —that is kind of—it's empowering.</p> Knowing that like, you know, when I have a fever, my body is trying to kill the bacteria, it's trying to raise heat so it kills the bacteria, you know? And—and knowing that my body wants me, you know, if I've sprained an ankle kind of—or done something much worse than that, actually, because I think you had to have a trigger for that—but, you know, that it knows that it wants me to not be, you know, so involved, therefore it mimics the same thing as being as being (inaudible) depressed.</p> And so, I don't know. I mean, I don't believe—I don't—and the—and the thing that is just really hard is that I don't want to believe—be one of those people that people believe—I've read Vitamin D, and therefore I'm a doctor after that. I would never try to diagnose myself.</p> Well, I'm not sure. I would never try to diagnose myself for something that I haven't had five or six times.</p> You know? </p> Like the tonsil infection that I—I—I used to get every year, I was pretty good at figuring it out, you know?</p> But you know, I'm not one of those people that believes I can—I'll go in the doctor and say, ""Oh, I have this rare disease that I saw on the Internet."" Yeah. But it's just—it's t just really like if it—I need to feel control over my life and it gets—and it's—you're right. It is because so much of my life is completely powerless. But I don't necessarily know if (pause) it's weird. It's like (pause) I don't know if I'll ever be able to be at terms with being completely powerless ever. I'm not saying I have to be that way for everything. I mean, I—I actually want to change for so many things. But I think that -</p> I'm still a little celluloid along that one road (laughs). But yes.</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, well like—and the powerlessness that I -am I running close to the -</p> Ok. Even the powerlessness of, like, you know, I was talking about my job like this, which was like big changes -</p> —once I realized that I can—the—the asshole that I used to be and work the system -</p> —I was like—I got reprimanded quickly to—just to say it was for having a personal conversation on the clock when I should have punch out first.</p> I—I was disgusted. I wasn't mad at first at who was having a conversation with me. I knew this was pushed down from much higher up than this.</p> And so like now whenever I am punching out late for something that seems illegitimate, know I put extensive notes in the time clock—they've got to be sick of this—</p> —but I have been to recently killing them with over information, and that makes me feel powerful.</p> I don't really feel like I'm hurting them or anything like that, but at least I'm documenting that what sounds like I'm talking to somebody about something on eBay is actually like me talking about mobile payment systems.</p> And you know, the new aisles. </p> Yeah, yeah. And it may not be obvious, but I don't want to have this—to back-pedal and scramble to—in the moment to do it. So now I'm just typing it up in my time card and it—it's actually helped me immensely. I don't know if anyone reads them or not, but if I ever get called into the office because -</p> —of the six minutes that I had of personal conversation every day, I can know say, ""Pull out my time card and ok, now you can see that it was a personal conversation."" So then—ok.</p> Thursday morning, yes. And if not, do you think you'll be able to let me know by mid-afternoon so I can come for the appointment by that time?</p> Ok. Hopefully, we will get back home before it rains.</p>",3
1004798941.txt,"Hi. It's been a while. Actually it's just been a week and a half, or two weeks. (laughs) Yeah. It sure seems like a while. Um, yeah I went to Florida and it was, you know, it was actually really fun. My dad was the pilot of my plane so he got to put me up in the cockpit before the flight, and got to show me lots of buttons. It was really nice. It was really fun.</p> Yeah. (sighs) It is a—it was like, naturally I'm empathetic so I feel bad —</p> cause I caused this depression. Um, but in the same sense I just said, ""Oh, that's too bad,"" and I realized that (pause for .03 seconds) you know, it's sad that it depresses her but in a sense it's positive. I can understand just how, you know, public restrooms still kind of—but I've gotten better—freak me out, it's logical within my own sort of narrowed vision, or within my own fears, you know. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And that's sort of why—in a sense that's sort of like what I told myself to make it better. [00:02:03]</p> It just seems all too hocus-pocus magic and so I have to understand and do every sort of calculation. Or maybe it's just that they had prior experience with quantum information, which I probably think is the case. Um, which is why they would be taking the class. </p> Oh, cause I thought it was going to be easy. (laughs) Cause there is like—I thought it was just going to be class presentations, and I thought I knew something about quantum mechanics. I mean, it's—and I thought, ""Oh, there's no final so I can be in the Nutcracker (pause for .02 seconds) for my mom."" [00:04:59]</p> Well, (pause for .02 seconds) I sort of just want to like (pause for .03 seconds), I do enjoy being a—not the perfect girlfriend—but I do enjoy making my boyfriend happy. It makes me happy, like cooking for him, and decorating, and spending time with him. And I do want to finish my PhD. Um, you know, and there's some times when I'd like to work on the weekends. [00:06:10]</p> And sort of like, I had to take a train, I had to take—and then she offered to have her husband pick me up at Amtrak but I think that was sort of like, you know, already at that point it's going to take more time and money for him to go 10 minutes to Amtrak. I could just walk to the bus stop and um, hang out with ghetto people, and then get on the bus.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. (laughs) I mean I had fun spending time with my family, but I just think like -</p> Well, making pasta with my dad and, you know, just sort of sitting while the TV was on with my mom. Maybe painting my nails, and seeing the girls at the Nutcracker, and just talking about general things—except that, you know, it was kind of like felt nervous talking to my mom quite a bit. Every now and then she'd drop a comment here and there, and like, you know, it's like why do I have to—(sighs) I don't know, I just, um—[00:10:17]</p> Yeah. [00:11:07]</p> Yeah, I mean, you know, it's just—but then again, what are my needs? Well I guess support and talking, but I can't have support because I'm doing something that depresses people. I haven't even told—I'd like to share that I'm proud of my apartment and I think it's coming together nicely or talk about designing or designer themes, but I mean, I haven't even told my sister.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, and I mean, (pause for .03 seconds) yeah, and it's just one of those, sort of like—I mean, I guess that's what it's sort of like: I'm there for people. I talk to my sister and like, as I (pause for .02 seconds) yeah, I was talking to my sister last night. [00:13:04]</p> (laughs) Oh, I know. (laughs) It's about, probably about when I tried to return the dress that my boyfriend bought me. I needed his credit card but he's in Santa Fe, so, but um, yeah, I mean it's just like—she had this sort of thing like she always talks about -</p> Let me turn that—just a second. Where are you? </p> Oh my goodness. (laughs) Well I guess we weren't wrong when we talked about returning this and getting his money (laughs) um, but, um cause I made the joke that they said if I didn't have the credit card I could get an in-store credit. And I said, ""That would be a bad idea—or would it?"" (laughs) [00:14:31]</p> Yeah, I mean, yeah. Not everything but in terms of like—she takes health sort of—as long as it's not associated with pain—she takes every little tummy ache very seriously. But you know, in terms of like generally the stress and the frustrations I'm dealing with, yeah they're different. [00:16:14]</p> Yeah. I mean, I guess it's just (sighs) (pause for .03 seconds) you know, I mean, I just sort of feel like I'm having—it's just the feeling I've had with my last boyfriend. Only at least my family talks to me and we can be in the same room and smile and laugh.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) It was funny cause when I told Jeremy a little bit about my mom of course he got very defensive, and he said that, ""You know, I felt like telling your mom I could take Janet, and we could go to the court right now and get a certificate,"" but he's like, ""I just don't have money for the ring or the whole wedding thing, you know.""</p> like if I have a baby or a child,"" and he even told that to his grandmother, and his grandmother sort of laughed. You know, and my mom's like, ""Oh!"" and I'm like, ""Well, of course that would be after we got married,"" and my mom's like, ""Yeah, yeah. You know I did talk to him and he's like—I was afraid that he was just going to be for having babies out of wedlock -"" or whatever than means, ""but he said he wasn't for it,"" you know or, ""He'd say he'd get married definitely before that.""</p> And I was just like, ""Shouldn't this be exciting? Here's a guy that's really in love with me, really takes care of me, such to the point that I feel actually kind of lost and disoriented without him,""—I mean I really do. I don't feel like: oh, who am I? what am I? I just feel like, oh I don't want to make breakfast. (laughs) </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) and I guess maybe that's why she started. She said she'd feel better when she saw me. I guess cause she saw that I was happy. She saw that —</p> Yeah (pause for .02 seconds) yeah, I mean that's the same thing. It's like there's (pause for .04 seconds) yeah, I mean, that's exactly it. There's this—it's supposed to be a good time in my life and instead I'm having to come make up grievances (ph) and take time out of my lifetime—time and energy and emotion—to make up grievances, or whatever that word is, (laughs) for something that should be very happy and celebrated. [00:19:57]</p> You know, in terms of what I do know versus—I mean school is—there's a lot of smart kids there.</p> (laughs) Yeah, and just to be mediocre in a Harvard class really says a lot against the, you know, general population. And it's just—I'm just tired of like, (pause for .02 seconds) it's like when it's just me and Jeremy—he really has helped me. And same with you have really appreciating (sic) what I've done and sort of decisions I've made. [00:21:07]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, (whispering) and um, (pause for .06 seconds) you know, and it's really interesting, as I sort of see—like, I flip through pictures, um, mind you my dad didn't take many pictures of my mom and us girls, but like there's so many more pictures of me and my sister together, or me and dad, or me, dad and Tammy together. [00:21:58}</p> (pause for .02 seconds) Well, part of me is just like, ""Oh, well, maybe I just took home some certain pictures that looked cute,"" or you know, ""Maybe I'm just using this to support my underlining thing of my mom just being very critical of her appearances."" Just so, very sort of like (pause for .03 seconds) um, I mean she really did love us. She loved us as children, and—[00:23:03]</p> (pause for .02 seconds) (sighs) No, I'm just sort of—I'm seeing—I'm questioning whether she wants to see me as an adult. And, you know, it's just frustrating because like, this whole sort of like ex-communication. </p> Right.</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah.</p> (sighs) Nothing else yet, but I mean (laughs) -</p> Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) I mean, finish my PhD in a year.</p> Yeah, and it's not looking so—I mean, it was looking good before the workload of this class. It's sort of, like no work for three weeks then an infinite amount of work in three weeks, so it kind of it's very oscillatory. You know, it has sort of opened my eyes up to how hard I will work on something when there's a direct task—[00:25:01]</p> and I know that there's a solution, as opposed to my research, where it's just sort of -</p> It's very open-ended. So I was like, ""Oh, you know, it's okay if I just go home and think about it.""</p> And I really don't, um. So in one sense I appreciate—I'm glad I'm taking this class cause it was sort of like getting me into the routine of reading on the bus, and doing calculations just anywhere. It was kind of cool because I see how I got to this place. I was starting to forget.</p> Um, but you know, it's (sighs) it's just I (pause for .04 seconds) yeah, I think just this past week having to go to Florida and fit that in, it was just sort of like frustrating, but, um. (pause for .03 seconds) And you know, it's also kind of hard cause I do understand—like I don't want to hurt people. [00:26:09]</p> And sometimes like you do have to realize that, you know, it's not your fault that they're hurt, but they're still hurt —</p> because of the way they see things. And I guess in one way I felt—well it did feel nice to visit my family and have a family dinner, cause we made pasta from scratch. It was me and my mom and my dad, but, um, like (pause for .03 seconds) I guess that's just sort of where I am, but (pause for .02 seconds) —</p> Well in terms of like, for what I had to do—just thinking of all my—like I was essentially alone; like taking Amtrak; making many different connections; and um, (pause for .02 seconds) I was actually pretty good. </p> But it's interesting cause when I was coming back, I guess the person sitting next to me had tracked a paper towel from the bathroom that looked kind of stained yellow and I was just, ""Eww,"" cause it was right next to me. And like no one else seemed to care. The flight attendant at the end of the flight just picked it up. I was just like, ""Oh, well, okay."" {00:28:13]</p> You know, it was just sort of like well okay, maybe I just sort of do have to relax a little bit more cause she picked it up with her bare hands and probably just won't wash her hands for a while. And I was like, ""Okay, well these things are gross. (pause for .02 seconds) And I think everyone thinks they're gross, but they're not unsafe."" </p> (pause for .04 seconds) Ah, just a little, just a little peeved, but nothing, like, huge. So in some sense like (pause for .03 seconds) I think like being, putting myself in these challenging situations, like being in a public—like when I took the Amtrak all the way home, I sort of—I really put myself in a challenge because it was out of my comfort zone.</p> And that was one thing on the plane, when I saw the flight attendant just picked it up at the end of the flight, I was like, ""Well, I guess I won't worry about—you know—toilet paper on the bottom of the bathroom floor,"" yeah, it's gross but I guess it happens to everyone. It gets stuck on their shoe and, um (pause for .02 seconds)</p> (laughs)</p> Yeah, yeah, and that's sort of what I see. I mean, I sort of—I do get mad at myself in case—like today, after I used the restroom and I washed my hands and then I was—for some reason I was just doing some sort of ballet pose. I guess cause I'm really tired and I was like, ""Oh -"" yeah, this just came to my mind (ph). And I was just, "" Okay, I don't know what I touched. Let me just wash my hands to be sure."" And I was like, ""Oh, no, no. Bad, bad."" (laughs) And so I was, so I guess I'm learning to relax a little bit more in the bathroom or like check where my contact is, cause it was really bothering me.</p> (laughs) And I was thinking, ""Well, wait -"" you know, I mean normally I have stigmatized these public restrooms to be gross, and sometimes they are. But, I mean, they are where people have done their makeup before, or splashed water on their face, or done more than just used the restroom. And, yeah, it kind of sucks if it's gross, but I guess we'll all sort of live.</p> (laughs) Yeah. Um, so, yeah and so I guess—I mean I'm catching myself (pause for .02 seconds) I sort of—it's kind of like a reassurance thing, but then I realize that I need to relax about the reassurance. I need to deal with the stress. I need to challenge myself a little bit more.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. (laughs)</p> (laughs) Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. (laughs) </p> Yeah.</p> (whispering) Yeah.</p> Yep.</p> Yeah, and I think that's where it's sort of—I realize like last year in a sense, like I was trying to—I was able to overlook it but not fully dismiss it. But I found like, now I've been just learning to laugh about it, like, ""Oh, well, that was kind of silly,"" and just -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, no, I'm just more like, I would be like, ""The flight attendant just picked it up, and here I was worried."" Just like, ""Silly me."" </p> I just sort of laugh about it, just sort of, ""Oh, that was silly."" Just sometimes little kids are afraid of things, just cause they really don't understand so they're afraid. And like when I was a little kid when my curtains sort of created this shadow, which I thought was a dragon, my dad convinced me that no, no, no, it was not a scary monster.</p> It was just a shadow and then I felt better. It wasn't like I was stupid—I was just, I did not have the frame of logic to -</p> to understand—</p> Yeah.</p> Um hmm.</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> And that's one thing—as my anxiety just (pause for .02 seconds) gets worse, I remember I'd look over and go (laughs), ""Eww, that's gross and then just be like, ""Oh, wow, is that person worried about it?"" and it's like, "" Well, no,"" okay, then I just, ""Eww, it's gross.""</p> Anytime my thoughts went to it, it would be, ""Eww, that's gross,"" or like, ""Why are you looking at it? Just pretend it's not there. You're going to be fine."" And so, um -</p> I think I can definitely try that. I think maybe I take a little breath—actually what I do is literally I shudder. Like, eww.</p> Really? (laughs)</p> Yeah. (laughs)</p> Yeah, you know it's interesting cause I actually do know when I go to the hospital I sort of like meditate -</p> Yeah, it's just relaxing and just closing my eyes, and I tell myself I'll be fine if I just sit here and take a deep breath. I'm always very relaxed and I think that's sort of the thing is like, if I encounter like a new stimulus that I'm not prepared for I may learn how to just -</p> take a step back and realize I'm just going to be fine, you know. [00:39:01]</p> Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) It's really interesting cause I have—it's been actually a long time since dance has like—normally I've been so focused on technique this past few years. It's very true that I've been like withdrawn from the actual feeling of it; feeling my body and being in touch with it, which is probably why I got put in intermediate cause I looked like I wasn't flowing with everything. [00:40:02]</p> I mean, I know how to relax and just fall asleep on the floor (laughs) or I know how to be nervous, but I don't know how to like, —</p> Yeah. (pause for .02 seconds) And it's really interesting cause living, um, (pause for .02 seconds) being so close now with my boyfriend, I sort of see that he sort of struggles with the same sort of issues. And he has to meditate before he goes to bed every night. [00:41:00]</p> So it's like—if I would just take a deep breath and say, ""It's going to be okay. It really doesn't matter. If you're that confused, you can try and ask for an extension. You'll find someone to work with, "" and I did. But—they're actually really nice: first year graduate students. But um, yeah, I think that's a—learning how to relax in the moment; I think that's something that I should definitely think about.</p> Yeah. [00:43:03]</p> (pause for .04 seconds) (laughs) Ah, I haven't been in a routine—normally it's my office, um, which is kind of messy but in the same sense it's sort of like, you know, I get there and I associate it with a one-hour break, so (laughs) I guess, yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I'll try and do that.</p> Yeah, and I think -</p> Very doable. Very good homework. (laughs) It's homework that I might have to ask questions on, but I know it's something that I at least know the premise of. (laughs)</p> I know how to approach it, and that's always the —</p> Yeah, that's always the hardest part.</p>",2
1004600926.txt,"Sorry. (inaudible at 07:31)</p> I'm just (inaudible at 07:43)</p> (inaudible at 07:48)</p> OK, sure.</p> Yeah. She doesn't really (ph) have a job, so she doesn't really (ph) pay rent. (laughter) So that's why it's been better to live with her because, you know, then it's just like (inaudible at 11:04), you know, I want to see it as being someone else's rent (inaudible at 11:09). So I don't know, like, I've made, like, (inaudible at 11:13) and stuff as to what exactly will be the best scenario—to stay put with my mom and saving money, that way I can go to school and take that part-time job, or go to school, work full-time and live separately. I don't know which scenario will make me happier and make me more productive. (laughter) I don't know.</p> (sighs) I'm just so, like, I'm not—my heart is just not in anything right now. I am heartbroken over Victor (sp?). I mean, when I went to see Graham (inaudible at 12:14) he was, like, my first, you know, real (pause), like, intimacy and, like, seven years, you know. (laughter) So, I had a good time and it was, like, my first experience like that in so many years. So, I have good memories of that. But then I started things with Victor (sp?) (inaudible at 12:38) in a whole drama, all that. Such a messy thing, and yet I had a good time with him too and then I fell in love with him and then that ended badly, so. I guess I just want to go to be away from here and be in the city and just have, like, Graham treat me, pamper me, you know. (laughter)</p> I don't know. Like, I had such a bad experience with Victor (sp?), like, recently, the stuff that he said that I feel like I want to be believe me and then the same time I don't want to believe me. Like, I said I'm sexually suppressed and it doesn't work with him, he's not satisfied. And so I don't really (pause) (sighs) I just have—I feel like I'm not good in bed, although, like, other men have not turned me away, (laughter) have not pushed me away, have not complained. But still, I don't know. Maybe I do have (pause)—maybe I do give signals that turn people, I don't know.</p> Yeah, I totally gave my heart to him, like, I really just (pause) put down all my barriers, like, put down my guard completely and trusted him completely. And even when he got really, really upset I gave him the benefit of the doubt and said, ""Ok, you're upset. You're acting from anger and that's fine."" I've never been like this with anyone. I've always—and that's the thing that he's hating too. He's like, ""You're just not in the same maturity level as me. I don't respect you anymore. I have a very low opinion of you. You're not even a human being to me,"" because all of these things, because I'm such a doormat with him. I don't know why [I'm always that way] (ph) because with other men I'm very, very mature and, like, I think. (laughter) Like, I can maintain my distance and (pause) [I don't know] (ph).</p> He represents that for me. Like, I had a dream where Victor (sp?) and David (sp?) were both defending their thesis. They were at the same program. But in my dream we're all sitting in this room and they're both defending and David (sp?) goes first and he's talking, and everyone's all impressed, and he's talking big and lofty. But while he's talking, Victor (sp?) is sitting next to me and he's holding my hand. And, you know, he's looking at me and he's paying attention to me. [00:17:03]</p> Yeah, yeah. Completely, I mean, which is why this is (inaudible at 17:58) because, like, you know, one moment he puts his finger inside my vagina and says, ""I'm going to open you up and, you know, this and that,"" and then the next minute he's pushing me away and, you know, he doesn't want to do anything with me. [We don't have to do anything] (ph). I don't know. He likes (ph) to push and pull, you know, that's his nature. But, I mean, I am trying to get the point where I can just put this aside and be a functioning human being again, you know, doing my job, work on my writing and take care of myself and my mom and (inaudible at 18:41). I don't think I'll ever stop loving him. It's just too intense from my side and I feel like it is from his side too. He's just afraid and he's just seeing this things that he doesn't like and I don't know. I mean, I want to show him that I'm not immature the way that he thinks I am. I'm not a juvenile. I can be (pause)—I can respond to him like an adult. (laughter)</p> Yeah, that's the problem (inaudible at 21:25)</p> Probably, yeah. Yeah, probably [my love will fad] (ph) if he's constant (ph) like me. (laughter) But it's so much nicer to have that though. Like, even, like, with David (sp?), like, I know he loved me. I mean, I knew he loved me and just (pause) I'm the kind of person who wants to share everything with the person that I'm with, you know, and like, if I see something beautiful I want to text them. If I have a nice thought, I want to keep it away so I can tell them the next time I'm with them. If it's a nice day, I want to see if they want to take the day off and spend it with me, you know. (inaudible at 22:16) Partly I'm afraid I'm taking the job because he said he would like me more if I had the job. Maybe just a passing comment he made long ago. he probably doesn't remember. Sadly, I remember every single thing he said. (laughter) [00:22:38]</p> Oh gosh. 2001 when we were, like, fighting and I came to live here.</p> He's actually here. We had a scary thing happen recently when my mom and I both got friend requests from him on Facebook. (laughter) We don't want him back in our lives. He apparently is in Los Angeles, appropriately. So...</p> He spends, he drinks, he smokes, he's a philanderer and, yeah. (laughter) He gambled away, like, my scholarship money and he would take money from my mom [and me] (ph). Like, she was the one who always had a job when I was growing up and even in the U.S. and he would control all the finances, telling her she couldn't handle them herself, so he had all the control and he would spend it on women and call girls. And, like, my mom would actually walk in on him having sex with someone.</p> No, she did this thing where she completely kept that side of him from me, sadly. I wish she'd told me long ago so that I would've helped her take the stand (inaudible at 24:08). So...</p> I made her leave him. It was about a house. Like, it came down to this thing where he wanted me to sign the loan papers. And this was going to be a loan for, like, 115,000 dollars, and I hadn't even graduated. And he convinced my mom too. And, you know, my mom was like, ""Why won't you do this for us?"" (laughter) And my boyfriend at the time, you know, the nicest, smartest guy. He taught me everything. Jeremy, he said, you know, ""Don't do this. I mean, you don't even have a job. You don't know."" The economy was kind of going bust. And how could I graduate, you know, taking such a big responsibility and, you know, like, the house was probably going to be, you know, a whore house. (laughter) Like, he would, you know, mess it up. I wouldn't probably be living there.</p> Oh very good. I had no idea. (laughter) Yeah, I had no idea. You can always joke when—he wasn't around much. When we were in India he would always, like, go away to different cities, but he always joked about having girlfriends and, like, in photographs of his workplace he was always surrounded by women. And there was this one woman who always came to our house and she was very simple and plain, and I really liked her. And then only years later, like, when I'm grown up and I'm 20 or 21, and then my mom tells me, ""Oh, she was your dad's second wife,"" basically. They even got married.</p> Oh, after. Like, so, I mean, they were having an affair. Like, he would bring her from his workplace, which was really close to where we lived. Like, he would bring her over and I guess they'd have sex in the afternoon and stuff. And, like, it got really intense for them and they got married. And my mom was weird. She's like, ""Yeah, I even offered that I'd step away, step out of the marriage and they could get married."" (laughter) I don't ever want to be like that shit. I hate that. Why was—yeah. No wonder Victor (sp?) says he lost respect for me because I turned into that woman. (laughter) I don't want to be that woman.</p> My...</p> Who is swept off her feet. [00:29:17] I was swept off my feet because it felt good and it felt romantic, and I thought that's an OK thing to do when you feel safe, but apparently not. (laughter) Apparently it makes you forget what's right and what's wrong. It makes you cheat, basically, on someone like David (sp?). It makes you—yeah. So, I don't want anyone to have that power over me. I don't want sex to have that power over me. It basically just destroys things, and it did in this scenario. Like, and like I said last year, I threw this big birthday bash for David (sp?) at Victor's (sp?) place. You know, we were such good friends.</p> This is before. This is last year, like, May 2011. And he bought me (inaudible at 30:21) biography for my birthday. And this year, he did absolutely nothing because I'm a woman. I'm, you know, I'm not his friend anymore. I'm this woman he's sleeping with, so.</p> I do. I guess when I try to write about him, I try to think about him objectively. [00:32:29] I had a dream this morning that I was with my mom and my father/David (sp?) (laughter) and we were going to IKEA and I was moving him into a dorm or a new room or something, and we were shopping for stuff and we were pressed for time so we were rushing, you know. I have just basically a lot more anger towards him, just, like, for practical reasons. Like, if he were still around, if he were just [likely more sane] (ph), you know, my mom would be living with him and I would've published something by now, you know. I would've not had the responsibility of my mom. But then again, maybe I'm just using her as an excuse. I probably am. Or my own feelings (ph).</p> What?</p> (laughter) To talk about my dad?</p> There's nothing I can do. I mean, I will talk about it and I'll just feel horrible and then I'll just sit and, like, wallow in this thing I can't really do anything about. So, I feel like I should just accept that I have her as a responsibility and just, you know, accept it and move on, you know. (laughter) You know, do something about it instead of just lamenting, but I've lamented about this for so long. (laughter) I mean, yeah, I wish she were married. I wish she had found some other guy. I wish I had siblings to share the responsibility, but I don't, so. Like, David (sp?) and I were talking the other day and he was like, ""You don't have to feel responsible for her happiness,"" and that's the thing. Like, I do. [00:34:35] I cannot help it. I feel like moving away from her and living with other roommates will be the solution because I'll be in a house surrounded by people for who's happiness, I'm not responsible, I don't care. But then, even with the distance I'll probably still worry and feel slightly guilty thinking that, ""OK, she's just sitting in front of the computer watching soap operas and (pause) feeling sad and lonely.""</p> No, not a lot, but just, like, little, little things that, you know, her knees bother her and she goes through therapy for that, and then she has seasonal allergies. I mean, she's very good about taking care of herself in that way that she will just, you know, go to the doctor by herself. I mean, sometimes she needs help. Like, yesterday I had to drive her to this place far away, like, 20 miles away. But, yeah. She's good about keeping herself occupied most of the time. It's just, I hate to see that she's lonely. I mean, but people deal with that. I mean, like, David (sp?) doesn't' even think for more than five minutes that his mom is lonely without him. But at least, I mean, he has—that's the thing. His mom is married, you know, like, her husband will eventually come home and he, you know, won't be having sex with other women and he'll be, you know... [00:36:45]</p> (laughter) Yeah. And, you know, she tells me that when I was born, like, no one really wanted to hold me and my mom was like, ""Take her away from me,"" you know, she didn't want to look at me and all that, so.</p> Well, because she was upset because, like, when I came along she was kicked out of her in-laws place because they thought that I wasn't my dad's because I came right after nine months of marriage. Plus they were unhappy with her about other things as well, so they sent her back to her parents, and I guess she held me responsible. Not for the whole time. She did, you know, bring me up so nicely. But that moment is kind of etched in her memory and she kind of brings it up. And I feel bad, but then I'm like, ""Well, you know, she was put under so much pressure at that time. So, you know, I probably would've reacted the same way, so."" I hope not, but, you know, I don't blame her too much about that, so. [00:38:57]</p> No.</p> Yeah. The new job. I mean, I don't really know. I'll have to (pause)—I guess I should think more about it, like, which scenario.</p> it's a difficult situation? Like, what do you recommend? (laughter)</p> Maybe, yeah. I mean, that's the thing with David (sp?). Like, he liked me and he's so fabulous in the sense that he's nice and he's steady and he'll always love me and he would never cheat on me and he's intellectually so ambitious and successful, and his family's good. [00:41:15] So, I just was like, you know, let's jump, you know, this is a good catch. (laughter) So I didn't really consider that, OK, maybe he's not so attractive and I'm not attracted to him. Yeah, I definitely think that if I find someone who, like, meets stringent (ph requirements then I just need to jump. But I'm not going to jump anymore, because (pause) I want to get to a place where it's like if there's in my life, great. If there's not, all right, you know. (laughter) I admire that kind of attitude and I've seen that in other women and I want to be in that place. But I think the only way that I will get there is if I have an occupation that completely satisfies me, and that will be my writing. Somehow, I have to work on that, but then I've also, you know, make money and pay my rent and mom's rent. [00:42:31]</p> Yeah. How do you live with disappointments still (ph)?</p> (laughter) I mean, I have to get to that point where I can say, you know, I've had so many disappointments in writing but it's still better that I'm doing this than not doing it, you know. Even the disappointments are worth it, because the process, the journey is fun. It can be fun. It has been fun at times. I just feel so horribly, like, so negatively about the times that I've spent on (inaudible at 43:28) stories that have gotten rejected. Like, they got rejected and then I think about, ""All those Saturdays I spent in the library working on that stupid shit, you know. It's so horrible. It's so ugly. What a fucking waste. (laughter) Why the hell couldn't I be objective and see that I just was not ready to write about that time or, you know, that scenario?"" (laughter)</p> Yeah. Well, I guess that would be because of my dad and his, you know, the things that he would say about how I wouldn't really do anything in life and just how he had very high standards for me and I never met them and never really made him happy, so.</p> Yeah, yeah, and much worse. (laughter) [00:44:29] Yeah, I do have this tendency to want to seek approval. One of the reason why I'm taking this job, my full-time, is because everyone approves of me and they keep telling me, ""You're so talented and we want you. Are you going to take the job? I hope you do."" (laughter) So, yeah, I'm not, like, Victor (sp?), I'm not that strong person who's [been beat] (ph), who can wade through shit, who can take a job where there is not that much, you know, approval and it's only hard work. I guess that will be the sign of the [strong person] (ph).</p> Yeah, yeah, because David (sp?) was really, really afraid. (laughter) And I've been asking other men, like, ""So, when would you kick a girl out of your home?"" They're all like, ""Well, if she's stabbing me."" (laughter) And then I'm like, wait, I didn't' do that. You know, I didn't threaten him. All I was saying was, you know, I love you. (laughter) And I can see from his point of view that he's just feeling this aversion to he's seen and he's probably also upset about the way that he's reacted to me. I mean, if some person brings out of an ugly side in you, you're not going to want to see them, you know. [00:46:47]</p> OK.</p> 10:30, yeah.</p> I have my checkbook.</p> I'm so sorry, this is not my right checkbook at all. Can we try my credit card?</p> I'm so sorry.</p> I was rushing and I picked up...</p> Sorry. (laughter) I mean, you can totally just charge my card.</p> I mean, I'll definitely bring my checkbook next time.</p> OK, thank you. Have a good weekend.</p> I don't know about that. (laughter)</p> [Yeah, but] (ph) I'll try to be calm. (laughter)</p> Thank you, bye.</p>",3
1004600932.txt,"Oh, it is already so warm. </p> We just picked up our car from the mechanic. It is my first time driving it, and I'm a really nervous driver. </p> Like, [chuckles] it just makes me really nerv—I didn't learn to drive until I was—well, I didn't get my license until I was 18, and, um, then it was, like, the third day I had my car, I knocked the mirror off—like, the driver's-side mirror—and then it was like [chuckles] something constant. Like, it was like, you know, speeding tickets and [shifts in seat]—I'm—and then I got—like, I was just always getting into little problems with my car, and then I eventually got a DUI when I was 20, and then [clears throat] I couldn't drive for a really long time, and then I was just terrified of driving, super afraid. [00:01:03]</p> Um, I'm still really afraid, but I knew if I got in the car, immediately when we got to the mechanic, then it would be a little bit better for me. </p> Um, so we got in, and I s-s-spun the car around to get some gas, and then—usually, I always want Chris to drive every—everywhere, and, uh, but I just—I immediately decided that I was going to do it 'cause if I didn't do it immediately, then [pauses] I wasn't going to [car honks outside] I wasn't going to—I just—it was just going to keep building up and building up. [Clucks] Yeah, it—now, I'm really excit—before, I was, like, really nervous about the whole thing about getting the car because of then [slaps hands in lap] driving the [chuckles] car. Um, and so, right now, I feel really excited about it. Um, I hate driving in the city—that's the only thing—and I hate, like that all—I'm always—like, there's [slaps hands in lap] people, and then it is just like I don't feel like I have a full awareness of—anyway, I get really nervous. Um, but I feel a lot better now after having driven, um, out [pauses] here from—where we [slaps hands in lap] honestly [it has been like] (ph). [00:02:15]</p> [Chuckles] Yeah. </p> [Chuckles] Yeah. </p> [inaudible at 00:02:24] [sniffles and exhales] Uh, yep. So this is the last session. </p> Um, [pauses] I've been really emotional the last few weeks [inflects, becomes emotional].</p> It is—[slaps hands in lap] feels pretty natural, just like how I normally [chuckles] feel. Um, [pauses] just really easy to—to do this. [Sniffles] Just smacked my hand really hard accidentally on the counter this morning, and it really wasn't really hard, but I just like immediately dissolved into tears. </p> Um, and I don't really cry about physical things, so that was kind of surprising. [Shifts in seat] Um, [pauses] [sniffles]—yep, just easy to cry these days. Um, [pauses] why did I put mascara on? [Sound of rubbing hands together, inhales] [Pauses for eight seconds] [I better do], uh, [inaudible], and I was just doing really well. She really likes it. Yesterday, she did say—when I picked her up, she said, ""I want to go home,"" but she's never upset, and she's never sad; she just looks exhausted, and they're both really tired. Um, but Sadie was—stayed for a nap and went [through the first time] (ph) yesterday, and she was so tired and so out of control with her emotions [slaps hand in lap] that it almost made me a little uncomfortable, like, because she [pauses] just couldn't process or handle anything. [00:04:00]</p> Um, [becomes emotional] [pauses] anyway, [pauses] um—[sighs] [pauses] so I feel like I should be talking more about, like, grander things. [Chuckles] Like, is the la—since we last meet (ph), I should be talking about more like, um...</p> [Clucks] I don't know, like reflecting more or something, um, or being more, [pauses] um, thoughtful about my time with them (ph) to—I don't know. [00:08:05]</p> Mm-hmm. </p> Mm-hmm. [Silence for 15 seconds] [Inhales deeply] [slaps hands in lap] Um, [as I've, too, an] (ph) anxiety a little bit that the woman that I was talking to from Sadie's school, to do the preschool groups, she's not contacted me, or at least she won't respond to—I e-mailed her two weeks ago, maybe.[00:09:08]</p> ...Because I don't—I'm not [device tone sounds] I'm not—it makes it a little harder for me to drive my car when she [becomes emotional, about to cry] e-mailed (ph) what is going on. Like, I don't, um—you know. [Shifts in seat] I would just like to know from her end. She doesn't want to talk about it at school 'cause, um, it is just not really—you know what? I think she doesn't want them to know [pauses] that she's leaving quite yet, but I don't even know if she's going to—so, anyway, the only times I see her, it is very quick and awkward, and [sniffles] [shifts in seat]—anyway, it is just making it really difficult for me. [00:10:12]</p> It was something that I'm really excited about, but [pauses] [clucks] if it is not happening, I really need to know that so that I can [slaps hand in lap] start work and remind her of some other options. [Pauses] Um, [pauses] but anyway—I'm just a big ball of emotion. [Pauses] [shifts in seat] [inaudible at 00:10:56] [00:11:00]</p> No, I guess not. [Pauses] [Device tone sounds] [And I've got to stop] (ph) [sniffles] [shifts in seat] Um, [fidgets] [pauses]—I guess not, but it feels like I should be. [Fidgets with objects] You know, I'm feeling like I just want to [pauses] enjoy my last few days here, and I feel like I'm just [pauses] wracking myself with emotion. [00:12:03]</p> Because this has been [becomes emotional] [pauses for three seconds] [becomes emotional, about to cry] really helpful for me. [Cries] I'm very, very grateful. Um, [pauses for eight seconds] [shifts in seat] ['cause he was definitely] (ph) [pauses]—she could (ph) try to see myself and how I seem about my relationships, and I'm grateful for that. I mean, I just don't think, you know, I was quite ready to do that on my own. [00:13:03] </p> So [pauses] [crying] [sniffles] but I do feel a lot better about so many different things now. [Sniffles] </p> Mm-hmm, me, too. I'm going to sit here with you. [Chuckles] [coughs] I just think things like that are funny. [Chuckles] I [sniffles]—uh, [pauses for three seconds] yeah. I don't—I don't want to lose that; I'm really afraid of losing that. [Pauses] I'm really afraid of, um, having to come—having—I feel like I rely on you now... [00:14:05]</p> ...Rely on this, and [clucks] [pauses for seven seconds]—but, uh, you know, I know that pauses]—I'm just a lot stronger. It is just not [becomes emotional]—[shaking it off] Uh, but anyway, I am—I am a little afraid [sniffles] so...</p> Uh, [pauses] going backwards?</p> Just regressing or [slaps hand in lap] forgetting things, forgetting [sniffles]—[pauses] forgetting [pauses] [slaps hand in lap] just kind of like realizations that I've had or [pauses for six seconds] just things that I think about myself, that I didn't think of before. [00:15:13]</p> Um, [pauses for six seconds] so—I don't know—I just, mm [sniffles]—I [could take off] (ph) really good that I can make it sound really sad. It is really amazing how I just am able to do that. [Chuckles] </p> [Chuckles] 'Cause it is like I'm saying how I feel really confident, I feel really good, and then I—but I'm, like, spinning it into this, like, [chuckles] negative form, like I don't want to lose. It is like I'm just, like, afraid of everything 'cause it is, like—it is like even though things are better, like, then I'm afraid that they're not going to be good. Like, I just have this fear and an anxiousness about me that just—it is like—it just still, you know, hol—it just dig—dig (ph) right in with that. [Shifts in seat] Um... [00:17:14]</p> Mm-hmm?</p> Yeah. </p> Mm-hmm. </p> [Sniffles] Yeah. I would just like to be a person who is more in the moment, I guess [slaps hand in lap]... </p> ...And is more grateful for things as they are. That's just something that I—I don't do well. Um... [00:18:00]</p> ...I just want to go to sleep, so I'll wake up, so it is a new day. And I want to, like—I just want to get on with it, [pauses] but I'm feeling like [sniffles]...</p> Yeah, it is really hard. And, uh, I'm, like, just—I think I'm more anxious to see what the next thing looks like. Like, for me, that's really a part of it. I want to, like, be into the next thing 'cause I can't see that, and I want to—I just want to see it so that I know it. [Pauses for eight seconds] 'Cause this, like, middle phase with staying here still but not in our home was really just kind of like [pauses]—it just made me feel really displaced and, mm, [pauses for seven seconds]—did better than I expected throughout all of it. Um, you know, we had that—that fight when they were—maybe the first weekend we were there, or the second weekend or whatever. [00:20:04] </p> Um, but he's started talking that way, and he just sounded really bad. But—and I just said it, later [down with one of them] (ph), and I just [pauses] [claps hand] I don't know—I just said to Chris, like, ""Yeah, my dad sounded really bad,"" but it wasn't in this way that normally feels like, [said sadly] ""My dad sounds really bad. Like, we need to bring him dinner."" It was like—I don't know. [00:21:00]</p> ...But it doesn't really make me sad. That may be cold, [pauses] but—I don't know—I'm going to bring him dinner, and maybe that will help him a little bit. I will sit through bringing him dinner to make myself feel better and think I'm not a terrible person. [Pauses] [clears throat] [00:22:09]</p> No, it is very unclear. [Pauses for five seconds] Our relationship is really unclear, [pauses] which makes it really tricky to navigate. [Pauses] And once—since I've had—like, I feel really obligated to [pauses] take care of him or to—not even take care of him 'cause there's—I can't take care of him, but to be in his life, I feel really obligated to be in his life and, um, to provide things for him that he has never provided for me, and [pauses]—mm, [clucks] that makes me really resentful and angry. [00:23:06]</p> Mm, you want things from me that you have never given [pauses]—you know, you've never taken care of me, so I don't know why you expect me to take care of you right now. </p> He doesn't see it that way, but, um [clears throat]—you know, he needs a lot from my brothers and I. He asks for a lot with absolutely nothing in return. I mean—and I'm not even exac—I mean, like, absolutely nothing. [00:24:00]</p> Mm-hmm. Because I never want to [pauses] appear cold or to—you know, I don't want to feel, like, shut off [shifts in seat] from him because I know that's cold, and I know that coughs] it is still the part of me in my head that says, ""Don't be like them. Don't be like them,"" and to be emotionally disconnected from your [pauses] family is to be a little bit like that. Like, they're [so involved] (ph) in coming by, but they're, like, physically and financially, and, like—you know, they're like emotionally dependent on each other in this weird way, where it is like who is more of an addict kind of way, but they don't really support each other, if you know what I mean. [00:25:04]</p> They're kind of cropped (ph) from each other. Like, they don't—they are cold to each other, [shifts in seat] and, uh, [pauses] to be, like, cold to him would see to fall in line with that. [Pauses] [sniffles] I also just don't want to be the person who carries around, like, [pauses] mm—the baggage that was my child—like, childhood. I don't want to carry that anymore. And, like, I'd like to put that down now, and I'd like to leave it, and [slaps hands in lap] mm, feeling angry at him [slaps hand in lap] or pissed off, or resentful feels like something that I'm still carrying. It feels like I've still got a little backpack on me or something. </p> Um, [clears throat] [pauses] so I'm trying to really—really trying to shake it off. </p> But I don't know. For the most part, I just don't really think about him anymore than, probably, I'd say I had to. [Chuckles] But that's the [effect it is] (ph). I'm afraid about being there and not being harder than me not thinking about him, because that feels great; it feels great not thinking about him. It is much easier to put that baggage down. Um, being there, knowing that I can just drive—you know, him knowing that I can just drive 30 minutes to see him—it is not as easy, 'cause that's when the—then you get the phone calls, and then you get the [inhales]—so that's not as easy. And it is not as easy to [pauses for six seconds]—for me to draw the lines for myself. [00:27:10] </p> [Slaps hands in lap] [shifts in seat] Oh, [pauses] I don't know when I decided [to get here] (ph), I stopped calling him. </p> I called him when I needed to [clears throat]—you know, the birthdays and the Father's Days, and all that, so the same could happen there. [Pauses] And I can just say to my brothers, like, ""I don't really want to be around Dad much."" [Pauses] That's OK to say. [Sniffles] [fidgets] 'Cause there's a lot of that, too—like, ""[I don't have enough time that I can make] (ph)."" [00:28:02]</p> [Clucks] Yeah. I'm also just, like, OK with just really spelling out exactly what it is that I need without a whole monologue of ev—like, things to back it up. [00:29:00]</p> Yeah. I used to feel guilty for a lot of things. [Slaps hand in lap] I don't know what that was. I used to feel guilty for so many things, always, constantly—and guilty for other people's emotions and, like, responsibly—really responsible for other people's emotions, and really responsible for other people's [pauses]—I still do. That's still something that I have a really hard time with, but [pauses]—yes, I just used to feel really responsible for people's, like, well-being and how they—just how they felt all the time. And that made me feel really guilty if there [wasn't a good] (ph). You know? And I almost always took on the nega—you know, it is like I felt a need to fix other people's problems. Or, if they were mad at a situation that I was involved in, it was because it was my fault, [pauses] and it is not always true. [Clears throat] I—I let myself be a punching bag more than I realized. [00:31:06]</p> Like, I would kind of throw myself in front of a lot of stuff because it just felt easier. It felt more—like, it felt right. It felt like—like that's how I identified mys—like, I was the problem; I understood that. Like, I—""I am the problem in a lot of things."" [Shifts in seat] [sniffles] And it felt, like, natural that, like [shifts in seat] [snaps]—like, I just didn't know I was doing it. [Pauses] Even if I took my brother where—it was the two of us fighting, like, I think I would get in front of other stuff for him. [Softly] I don't know. [Sound of leaning back in chair] [sniffles] [pauses for eight seconds] [00:32:00]</p> Monday, I was exhausted. </p> Yeah, I also ran, so I had that other physical workout, [chuckles] too. [Sniffles]</p> But, yeah, it really can. And then if I was off to a—like, you know when little kids have a temper tantrum, and then they come down from it?</p> I do it for the rest of the day. </p> I also do that emotionally inhales] noise if I've felt like I've needed to cry, but I don't cry; I'll do that. Like...</p> ...I'll have that, like—it is not like I do it intentionally; it just like—my body just does it, um, [pauses] and I know it is very strange. [00:33:00]</p> [Chuckles] </p> [Chuckles] </p> I know. I know. [Sniffles] [slaps hand in lap] I think I think it is really strange. </p> [Shifts in seat] [sniffles] [exhales] [sound of rubbing something] Yeah, maybe I project feelings onto other people, huh? [Pauses] [whispers] I probably do. I absolutely do. [Pauses] I have to leap pretty far with, like, little things that people say. I, like, start here, and I go—wazhooop!—way over here. [00:34:00]</p> Yep, pretty much. </p> Am I breathing? [Chuckles] </p> Mm-hmm. </p> Yeah. </p> No, I know. </p> Right, yeah. I'm so good at that. [Sniffles] I am very good at that. </p> [Clucks] Thanks. </p> Thanks. </p> Do you really think that, or are you...?</p> I know. I have a hard time believing things that people say. </p> Yeah. If I could physically turn away from you [slaps hand in lap] right now...</p> [Chuckles] ...Just to—that's what I do when people say those things to me. I have to, like, not look at them. Um...</p> It makes me uncomfortable to look at you while you're lying to me. [Chuckles] Just kidding. Um, [pauses]...</p> Yes. Um...</p> It feels really great, because, you know, [pauses] that's what I—I don't know. [00:36:00]</p> Thanks, I think so, too. I think it is—it is absolutely good for me to launch in [slaps hand in lap] place for the next phase. I feel more adult. I feel like a grown-up. Like, I feel less [pauses]—it still just felt like a kid, like if, you know—I think I saw people—when they would say that about my parents, they had kids so young that they could never grow up—I think that it is hard to heal from things, and if you don't, then you just stay—stay a little bit young. [00:37:03] </p> I don't mean that in a good way. [Chuckles] </p> Because I'd like to stay forever young, actually. [Clucks] But, um, [clucks] now this feels much better; I feel much like—I feel ready to be [pauses] better. Yeah. That was—I didn't even mean to say that, but I do—I feel ready to be better. [Slaps hands in lap]</p> [Clears throat] </p> [Clucks] It was really a bad idea to put, like [sniffles] [fidgets with object]—[exhales for five seconds] now I've just got to get Chris [pauses for three seconds]—it is hard to—this is a good idea for him. [Chuckles] [00:38:00] </p> [Chuckles] 'Cause I know that you're thinking that I don't have to get Chris to do everything; Chris has to want to do it for himself. Chris also should want to do it for me, [sniffles] in my personal opinion. </p> I don't know; I just decided it. </p> Um, [exhales] well, I think we've had—we've had another conversation one time [pauses]—[clucks] we had one conversation one time that I was saying that I—I said the complete opposite of what I just said to you, the exact opposite. I said that shifts in seat] I can't make Chris want to be better for me; like, I can't make my dad want to be better for me. </p> I'm saying the exact opposite of what I just said, that are completely—you said, ""I don't think that's entirely true,"" and I gave it some more thought, and I agree. [Chuckles] sniffles] [leans back in seat] And, um, [pauses] so I don't know why you were thinking that—in my mind you were thinking that. [00:39:11]</p> Mm-hmm. [Clears throat]</p> Yeah, [pauses] I hope so. I don't—I feel like I'm a person—I don't remember things; I just don't remember them, and I lose myself into these, like, just feelings before I can even notice it, and that just scares me. Like, I'll just wake up and be—like, [pauses] having such bad anxiety that I can't get through a single day, and—and then, all of the sudden, I'm like, ""How did I get here? How did this happen? How did [pauses]—?""—I don't know. But, yeah, I'm really afraid of those things, of just like—of not remembering or of—next (ph). [Slaps hands in lap] I'm really afraid of not remembering stuff [rubs hands together]... [00:41:04]</p> ...'Cause I don't feel like I'm remembering. [Pauses for five seconds] Is that normal from] (ph) your childhood? [Chuckles] Can they put that on something? </p> It is true. </p> Yeah. </p> [Sniffles]</p> Oh, it is—it is a whirlpool effect. Um...</p> Right. When I leave every session, I think about it almost the [inflects] whole week or, like, until the next session. [00:41:59]</p> Like, I don't trust [pauses]—like I don't trust that I remember things right or that I remember the things that I need to remember, or that I, um—or that I've rewritten something to make it seem how I want it to seem. [Pauses] But I [do that] (ph). [00:43:08]</p> Mm-hmm. </p> Mm-hmm, yeah, [pauses] [softly] I think that would be better. One day, I came in here saying that, ""I don't want to feel like this forever, and I don't want this to get worse,"" and now I'm leaving and saying, ""I think that'll be better. I think this is good. I think that will get better."" It is just a complete 180. </p> Like I—and I remember you saying that, ""Why would you feel like this forever?"" And that was such an enlight—an interesting idea to me... </p> ...That, like, I ne-ver thought of that. It (ph) was brilliant. To me, I was like, ""I need to write that down!"" [Chuckles] [shifts in seat] Like, why would I? I don't know. I didn't think of that because this is how I feel right now. [00:44:06]</p> Mm-hmm. [sniffles]</p> Mm-hmm. </p> Mm-hmm. [Pauses] Yeah, it was—[slaps hand in lap] it is very interesting. [sniffles]</p> We've got to stop. </p> [Shifts in seat] [Pauses] </p> [Becomes emotional] [sniffles] Thank you so much. </p> [Emotionally] Can I give you a hug?</p> [Begins to cry] Thank you so much. </p> OK. Thank you so much. </p> Have a great summer. </p> [Whispers] Bye. </p>",2

It's just been making me so miserable because I won't be anymore and it changes everything and everybody will change over the summer... </p> ...kind of. And so I've kind of been feeling like (making noise).</p> Yeah. I guess that everybody - I don't know. Everybody's like deciding where they're going to live next year and I can't decide what to do, as usual.</p> I can't decide whether I want to - I mean I can't commit myself to stay here, because I was so unhappy this year it seems like I should start over somewhere else. I keep on thinking that I want to leave. Then I keep on [lot VA.] (ph) [0:04:24.8]</p> You know because - so I don't know what to do.

They all think Rebecca is really crazy. (chuckling)</p> Yeah. That's another - but it's a beautiful house and they have a backyard.</p> It was really difficult before there were all sorts of unfortunate things going on between Rebecca and Meredith and a boy. He was both of their lovers or something but I stayed out of it.</p> The window's different now.</p> A cast of the green.</p> Yeah.</p> I kind of feel like an old friend who like sees somebody they were once close to and then doesn't know what to say.</p> So like estranged or something.</p> I should have let you do that thing that you had to do.</p> Oh, really?</p> Oh, if you would've told me that it would have been really different.</p> I would be glad to even stop and let you do that. Because I just, I knew that I felt like if I was put off because you hadn't done something that you were supposed to do, I knew I would've felt shitty and I, and I wouldn't have felt like talking to you or something. But... </p> ...it makes me feel - because I was supposed to be somewhere, etc., etc.</p> And I feel put upon. But the idea of - that you have to do something of your own... </p> ...in your head.</p> ...makes me feel good.</p> So I would be glad to stop right now.</p> Why don't we? [0:09:37.2]</p> Oh? Okay.</p> Well, maybe I should figure out what all I'm into?</p> I don't know. [silence from 0:10:43.4 to 0:10:56.0] I guess I feel I wouldn't mind talking to you, but I don't want to be sitting here... </p> ...in this room looking out the window with that tape recording going and the idea of trying to get something done. You know and I also just feel like I can't talk in that situation. I just had a really long talk with this girl that I don't know well and it was just a really important talk. And I'm going today, I guess that's why I was feeling nostalgic because I was thinking about - and I can really easily talk to her and I don't know her any better than I know you, so... [inaudible at 0:11:25.1] But I can talk to her and I feel the same trust towards you that I feel towards her, but I don't want to talk to you, I mean about it anymore for this one reason. So maybe I resent - yeah. I mean I don't know what I've gained by it, you know? Like I said, I don't know what help it's been to me.</p> And I guess I have a feeling like, well you were bothered by something when you walked in and I was a bitch and said, ""I have to be somewhere."" Which is true, but if I had known that it was something for you I would've...it would make me feel...it would've been fine with me. But just somehow, like you have something like on your mind and I'm keeping you from...feeling a little bit better....because that's - now you have to listen to me and you still have this unlooked at grumbling this morning.</p> Yeah, that's part of it, yeah. [0:12:36.5]</p> Yeah. You know and I don't want to...I meant I don't want to do that.</p> Okay. I guess then it's just I don't know what I want.</p> It's like I don't know what... </p> ...we can do. I mean... </p> ...I guess a lot of it is I don't know how far I can personally move right now.</p> And I don't know how far you can help me in this situation or, I mean I don't know. And I still like you a lot, but somehow trying to get somewhere that I don't think I'm going to get this way, just makes me feel like, ""Wow, that's really a shame."" You know it's a shame that that's how I know Ariel, so that when I see her in somebody's backyard she kind of is a little bit, ""Hi."" But doesn't stop, just...like but it's like not that we're friends, you know. That's a shame.</p> Yeah.</p> Right, yeah. I mean I feel...it's not necessarily, but since I don't feel like I've bloomed really far in it.</p> And I guess I've gotten certain things from it, but I don't feel like I've really done as much as I thought therapy was supposed to do or something. I mean I don't know what that means either.</p> Right. And I guess I'm also kind of - because I knew like when you - the telephone rang and I walked into that room, I all of the sudden had this...the other room over there, I wanted to say, ""Oh, Ariel, lets go sit there because it's more sunshiny there."" I thought, ""Oh, lets go sit here. I'd much rather sit here."" And I thought of - just all of the sudden I had this comfortable feeling of you and I sitting on the couch and talking, and then I realized why we couldn't sit in there was because of that...and then I realized as I walked back in here that I really didn't want to sit in this chair. I had an impulse to go sit there. And I said, ""No, no. This is the chair you're supposed to sit in. That's the chair Ariel's supposed to sit in. And we can't go sit in that room that's more sunshiny."" And everything was how I didn't want it to have to be. And so I'd, you know...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, and also I don't even know what I want to tell you, you know?</p> You know it's not that I feel like there's anything to like keep from you, but what am I supposed to do, tell you all the key things that have happened since I saw you last? (chuckling) [0:15:40.1]</p> You know?</p> And I mean like, I keep on... </p> ...talking in summary...keep on saying - I mean you - go on, you were about to say something.</p> I mean I keep on trying to like, take an overview of things and then present them to you, instead of like sitting in the middle, like I...because you don't know stuff so I tell you. Like I can't get across what I mean.</p> Do you know... </p> ...anyway?</p> Yeah.</p> Right. And I know I maybe feel like doing that. (chuckling)</p> So.</p> You know and I'd kind of much rather hear what's with you, feel better, be supportive and how come I'm feeling a little bit better and...or like...</p> Or, I don't know, you never... [silence from 0:16:57.5 to 0:17:04.6] Also I... [silence from 0:17:05.5 to 0:17:14.5] Sometimes it just helps to like have a really nice conversation with somebody...but it's just like, you don't like talking about passed stuff. You're just talking about something right then. But it like gives me new energy. It makes me feel better instead of like, just confusing you with passed stuff, but like stress for exactly where you are. Okay, so there are like a whole bunch of icky things but you don't have to necessarily talk about them. You can like talk about something that is making you feel good and it will make me feel better for a while.</p> Well like I spent all day, I mean all - the reason I came in and said I was nostalgic was because I spent the whole day talking to this girl about Oliver. She's definitely delving into passed... </p> ...ickies... </p> And...</p> ...so it's not that I feel so really just good from that. I guess I just felt good about also, I mean, having - I mean I - she's Oliver's new girlfriend, Oliver's found a girlfriend now.</p> And I really like her. I knew her before. And we had this really important conversation about me and Oliver and Oliver and her, and stuff. But overriding all the pain in the conversation, I ended up having a really good feeling. First of all because I really talk to somebody... [0:18:53.8]</p> ...and they really talked to me.</p> And also because I could, because I have made contact with this new person.</p> And it just really made me feel good to - because she's a super woman, she's just really neat.</p> I don't mean superwoman... </p> ...not that. She's like really... [overlapping voices at 0:19:07.5]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And she really and she...and I really felt, it made me feel good that we could both care about each other so much.</p> And that's really, and I've really liked her from afar for a long time and I know that she's like me. And that just made me feel good...and I don't know...I don't know how much you're ever a person with me.</p> Right. Right. And I can't tell if it's because you don't want to or if it's because that's what you think therapy is...if it's a combination of the both or whether you're just not accessible or something.</p> I don't know. I don't know what's wrong.</p> I know I did. I mean I guess I've taken myself farther away and then become less involved in my family (ph). I mean I'm... </p> It's probably subtle.</p> Yeah. Except for - I don't know. For some reason I kind of resent or there's just a little bit of feeling resentment or something. I don't know exactly what it is. [silence from 0:21:10.1 to 0:21:34.2] Like I would just say all these things and I realize I'm saying them kind of, not hostilely but definitely... </p> ...putting a distance and barrier there. And I don't know if I feel as much of a distance and barrier as I'm putting there. I think I'm trying to get like a spark out of you. I'm trying to like get you to at least say, 'fuck you' to me, and that I'd rather have you say that than just say what I - repeat what I say. I kind of I guess also...I don't know. [0:22:09.3]</p> I almost feel like I want to put you on the spot.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, right. That even helps, just having you say that.</p> I mean well, yeah. How does that make you feel?</p> What you said. Does that like relieve you kind of?</p> Right. Right. Yeah, like I'm really pressuring you. [silence from 0:23:25.4 to 0:24:12.5] And so I can't tell if I'm involved or not involved.</p> I feel like maybe what I should say is then I feel like I'm not able to get to myself or do something that I feel is real progressive in therapy so maybe I should just stop. You know and as soon as I think of saying, 'well Ariel why don't we just stop.' Then I think, 'okay, I'll get up and leave the room.' I think also that, 'come on Stacy that's really melodramatic or are you doing that just...are you doing that to stop from admitting you're already back in Ariel's office and involved in being a client again?' And then I can't tell if I... </p> You know?</p> Or whether if I'm just like saying that so...and I can't tell.</p> Damn it. (chuckling) I don't know. [silence from 0:25:30.0 to 0:25:59.8] I don't know. [silence from 0:26:00.1 to 0:26:55.6] I feel like I've rushed in and pointed all these boney fingers at you and forced you into some corner and started barking at you or something.</p> You know, how odd.</p> Right. Well that, that's... [overlapping voices at 0:27:30.4]</p> Right. Yeah. I'm also just wondering where all that came from.</p> And I have no conception of when I came over here that any - I would say any of that and I don't even know how much of it I feel.</p> I must feel enough of it to have said it.</p> But why should I bulldoze you into a corner...and like I mean it wasn't very much of a corner but (chuckling) I mean all those feelings of getting mad. God.</p> It made me feel better. (both chuckling) [0:28:17.8]</p> [nonverbal 'yes']</p> And maybe that's what I wanted. You know? I don't know. [silence from 0:28:31.1 to 0:28:41.4] Also I was sitting there trying to self-righteously be a bitch. (both chuckling) You know?</p> Well... </p> No, I didn't plan it but, I just had this feeling like I can - I don't know. Like now I feel like, 'I'm talking to Ariel, isn't that great.' I don't know. I guess it also hurt me to say that I hadn't gotten anything from it. And I think maybe I wanted to hurt you or something. Because I thought it would and then I mean I said, ' it probably wouldn't hurt you and I mean because it's not that much skin off your back one way or another.' But it was kind of like I was - I don't know. It was like, it's like a disappointment and I was trying to - because I wanted to make you a part of the disappointment, too. I mean, you know.</p> I don't know really but maybe that's it.</p> Yeah. Why is that? Is that because I wasn't ready to get anywhere?</p> (big sigh) [silence from 0:31:18.7 to 0:31:29.8] Yeah. I wish I knew. It would make me feel easier. You know it might, I mean I also had the flash that maybe it's like the first time you get stoned. You know you don't know... </p> ...you don't know what to look for, you don't know what...and it takes so long, it takes a couple of times before you realize that...that you have or that you're incredibly stoned. (both chuckling) And I'm like...I have this feeling, 'well maybe in a while or next time after I see it...at some point I'll see a therapist again and maybe I'll realize, wow, I really got a whole bunch from Ariel.'</p> 'Maybe it like follows in retrospect.' And I think probably that's a lot true. And I don't know. I don't know. I really feel like I was vicious though when I came in and I'm really sorry. (chuckling)</p> Because I don't really feel vicious. I mean I really don't. (chuckling)</p> And if anything I guess it's like I'm disappointed because I wanted to go further... </p> ...and I wasn't able to and so I wanted you to feel badly that we couldn't go further, and so to do it I had to like shove it in your face or something.</p> Shove it in my face... </p> ...I think I mean. [silence from 0:32:58.8 to 0:33:31.3] [I just don't know things. Like I don't know what the thing to do is.] (ph) (whispering in a singsong voice)</p> What are you going to do this summer?</p> What's... [overlapping voices at 0:33:54.5]... </p> Stay in New York? </p> Yeah, I guess, yeah. Yeah, I guess maybe there's an unwillingness to try to dive back in and... </p> ...and then...have it only be three sessions.</p> But I guess there's also just a general unwillingness to dive back in. I mean I've...basically been not talking to anybody and I, it's been a relief not to see you. Not so much because of you or just because of knowing that I will be seen thinking about myself a lot. I think about myself a lot anyway.</p> A large part of, a large bunch of introspection.</p> But, I just have a feeling like it's not, my life isn't good enough and I can't make it good right now. And that when I change, when I like move from this place and I have the ability to start all over... </p> ...then I have...then I'll have a fresh start and then I either make it or sink, you know?</p> But I have a feeling like I really fucked up this whole year and I've... </p> ...antagonized all my friends.</p> Not all of them but...a lot of them. And I'm not close to anybody and... </p> Right.</p> Right. I mean because I, it...gives me a lot of pain even though I'm trying to bury it.</p> I mean...and I don't know if it's better to, I mean it's always saying to yourself...'well it's just better to bury it because...chalk it up to experience....'</p> '...or something'. But...I don't know what I can make of it. I guess I'm a lot...some of that comes from everybody else around me is giving up, too. I'm not, I'm just talking. I don't know. [silence from 0:37:08.8 to 0:37:23.3] I guess that's what I was almost glad about that it was going to be over.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. [0:37:55.9]</p> Yeah, [I think I am.] (ph) Yeah. [silence from 0:38:26.4 to 0:38:50.9] And I guess and then there's another part that says, 'well...you should go away'...and you said I've, how somewhere else maybe it will turn out the same. Maybe you are essentially, maybe you essentially fuck up any situation you get into. That's like too heavy... </p> ...to worry about. I mean it's like too important...and I, and too - what's the word, devastated.</p> You know?</p> Well I mean I know there are elements of that in there.</p> But I don't know what is and what isn't. I mean I don't know what is, what are a lot of unlucky circumstances, which there are some... </p> ...and what is my doing. And I really think it's a combination.</p> And I don't feel like everything that's happened, happened to me, you know?</p> It's like and I feel like I cause things.</p> I feel responsible for some things.</p> But it's true I don't feel responsible for everything.</p> And I can't separate what it is, I mean what I do from what's happened.</p> And I think there is and I'm afraid of saying - I mean I know that it can't be. It's not that stuff happened to me because - I mean I know that isn't true.</p> You know it's just like this passive relationship to the world and it is fucked up and untrue..and it's just a way of shirking.</p> But...also I think the hole I'm in is a lot deeper than I could possibly dig myself. (both chuckling) You know? God.</p> Yeah. I mean it's...there are nice things, too.</p> There's some nice things. I just had a really nice talk with that girl Tricia.</p> Yeah. I was so close to Cathy and - I'm not close to her, I haven't seen her at all but I know that Rachel.</p> But I've met some new nice people.</p> Things like that but, basically the people that I'm worried about and that I care about, nothing's...Marco and I are still negating each other.</p> You know we can't be friends and I really want to be. And Melinda and I...got going now but we're really not friends. We're more just nice suited to each other and we do things together every once in a while but I'll never trust her, you know. The next day after telling her, talking to her, she'll treat me like shit...and I'm not surprised.</p> I'm not even that. I don't even...I'm more, I'm angry more than hurt.</p> I mean I'm glad that there's been that change. I used to be just crushed and now at least I'm angry. And I'm angry at Marco too, for like keeping me so far away when I know that he cares and he knows that he cares. He tells Tricia that he cares.</p> You know... </p> ...like why can't he tell me? You know why can't we, why can't - and now I know we like know each other so well. I know that...it's just we both have really strong intuitive feelings about each other. You know and he knows that's true and I know that's true. And with Rachel, he like keeps me really far away, just...in two years I've talked to him three times...for ten minutes a piece or something...that's really ridiculous when both of our lives we've had a whole lot to do with each other. And so Tricia tells me that he really cares...but he can't say that, you know. He says, 'hello' and walks away.</p> That's such bullshit. That really just makes me feel - and every time I've taken initiative he doesn't, he won't respond even, much less take an initiative of his own. So he catches me in this trap, you know. I can't make him do it...so it just makes me feel impotent...and fucked up. And Diane was... </p> Yeah. You know and I'm also angry for like putting me in that position, because he knows that I love him and he knows that I'm really, in some emotional way, always going to be involved with him. So he has that security. I can tell every time I see him because I can't help it. It just like radiates out of me. [0:44:19.9]</p> You know and he knows and I can tell he knows that I can see that he knows it, and like...just - I don't know.</p> But I'm also scared to call him on it. I'm also scared to say, man...because I'm always scared he's going to say, 'fuck you, I don't care.' You know like although somewhere I know that he wouldn't mean it and that he was just hiding...but I'm scared he'll do that.</p> I don't want to hear it. Yeah. Because there's nothing else I could do after that. I mean I couldn't even say hello to him after that. At least I can still say hello to him. But I don't think I even... </p> Yeah. I'm just...and John's getting married on the 12th of June and Alan would call up every three weeks and say, ""You wish you were marrying him?"" What can I say? (chuckling) Nothing. And that's another thing. I mean Holly's away, and she was here and I felt pretty far away from her. I think that she felt pretty far away from me. And Katie and I are completely and utterly estranged. We're not even friends anymore. We just never see each other and there's no warmth for me to - and I've just kind of stopped wanting to. I stopped - I don't know. Every once in a while, like my friend Michelle came in yesterday and I had a really nice time, really. You know and I've been getting letters from people that are nice you know. And my sister calls up and tells me she'll pay my way to Texas if I'd come out and live with them, and other nice things, too.</p> That's how it makes me feel, too.</p> And I feel really like there's nothing I can do now.</p> You know the only - the best thing I can do is get away from all these people...and not see them. And hopefully when I see them again in a year or something...a lot can be forgotten and maybe we can start all over again.</p> You know, like kind of sweet...like... [0:47:11.7]</p> Yeah. I mean, yeah. [silence from 0:47:29.4 to 0:47:44.5] But that almost... </p> Yeah, that's it. That's it all right. And also that I'm feeling just excluded from the families that are being created that I'm not in.</p> You know, that's there, too. I feel often I wish I could start over with everything...everybody, everything. I saw this little kid the other day, this little blonde boy. He was... [inaudible at 0:48:15.2] ...and I could see that. I was seeing a really - I just started watching him, just really wanted to be really like that and I could just like start all over again.</p> Yeah. And I guess also there's...then I think, 'okay, I really should go someplace else in time, which is, but then I get really scared because all my life I just always end up going - like Holly's going back to New York next year. You know? She went to Joseph and she couldn't find the people (ph) that she wants, and Joseph is in Trenton and he's just going to finish graduate school there but...he hasn't found the people that he wants...and the reason I came here is - and everybody I know it keeps on gravitating back here. Because everywhere else I meet you really need people and I find neat things going on, but there's this core of really great people here and I'm really scared that...that somehow the vortex is...or the place to be or something is here and I'm not making it so I shouldn't stay. I mean it's not making me happy and I'm not feeling good so I shouldn't stay. I feel that about - there's this crazy scale. Oh, this is really - uck! I don't even want to talk about this.</p> Yeah. But inside I guess I feel that way. I only feel that way when I'm in New York though, never anywhere - whenever I'm anywhere else it just seems like people are people. When I get back here there's this like nasty superiority about this breed of New York people. That really...I believe it but I'm also repulsed by it. (chuckling)</p> You know and also, and then also the idea that they're really the special ones and not - and they're not...and they're not all liking me means that - and all the other people are, means that I'm not really - I don't know. This is so crazy. It's hard like for me even wanting to say so.</p> And then it's, what am I going to do?</p> Yes. God, it's really, it's... </p> Well that and... </p> No, what were you going to say?</p> Right. Right. You know like except for immediately, as soon as you say that I feel that's not true. (chuckling)</p> You know like it's really horrible. I don't want to talk about this anymore. (chuckling)</p> Well I think it's, I mean... [inaudible at 0:51:55.9] And I also know that it has to do with rotten things like intellectuality and games like that, you know.</p> Because like...I know that I was division in my head about west coast people and New York people. Like west-coast people are much looser and easier and less uptight about stuff.</p> But they're also less deep in some important way.</p> You know maybe less moronic (ph) but they're losing something in the deal.</p> And that really is my experience of the west coast in a large part. But I've met really super people who are really easy but there's something that I miss about being mentally torn . . . </p> ...that makes me close to somebody when they share it with me that I feel here.</p> You know? God, that's really disgusting, too. (chuckling) You know? First of all to generalize for a whole group of people but also to end up liking what I like is pretty disgusting, too. I don't know. [silence from 0:53:05.4 to 0:53:10.1]</p> Right, that's more it, yeah. Yeah. I mean I've always - that's like...the most, that's the most consistently painful past memory I can remember. I mean the memory, my earliest memory is one of exclusion, of being forgotten and like the very earliest thing I can remember is when my parents left me, you know? I mean and I've always had this thing about... </p> ...missing out on any stuff, missing out on this really big thing, you know.</p> Missing out on something important that's happening.</p> I still have that all the time... </p> ...on a day-to-day basis. I mean Jesus, should I go over to Jen's tonight or should I go to the something?</p> You know, which one would be better for me to do, which one, you know? And I go through those imaginations (ph) all the time.</p> It's really horrible. I haven't grown out of it at all. And only when I'm with somebody I'm utterly hung up on do I feel comfortable, like I'm not missing anything.</p> When I was with Marco I never, was never missing... </p> ...anything or John... </p> ...or with Diane.</p> Because they were the, you know? (chuckling)</p> Yeah. Yeah, that's completely it. Mostly I've, once I'm with someone that I really love it just doesn't matter.</p> You know?</p> But unless I'm with somebody that I really like, I'm just really - I mean the horrible thing probably always like frantic about not being where I should be.</p> Yeah. I mean if anybody was telling me about these things I would think they were this horrible person. (chuckling)</p> It's hard to like reconcile myself with these things that are very objectionable... </p> ...and which are like inside feelings that I have.</p> Like status seeking doesn't sound right to me.</p> But... </p> Yeah. I don't think it has that much to do with status. I mean it has to do with being accepted.</p> But I guess it is, I always pick a particular bunch of people that I have to be accepted by in order to feel really accepted. I usually pick people who don't. And I can't tell if I pick them before or after they exclude me. (chuckling) It might be after they exclude me...when I pick it. God. I don't know.</p> That's the thing is, I'm going to start like realizing how fucked up I am when I tell you about all these things.</p> I guess I also go, I like keep on refusing to identify myself with the fucked up parts of me. And I keep on saying, ""Well that's not me.""</p> You know? Like when you said, just when you said the thing about seeing the little boy and wanting not to be me. It was like, well it's not that I don't want to be me. I'm fine being me.</p> But not just not this fucked up things.</p> You know?</p> Which I don't, which are the not me...things.</p> Yeah, that's probably part of my problem. (chuckling)</p> Well I feel like I should be a lot more together than I am.</p> I mean I don't know what it is. I mean I guess that...I want to be happy.</p> You know? And I look around and most of the people I know are. I know that's part of or at least Katie is. For some reason everything's revolving Katie now. That's because she's the latest person who doesn't like me.</p> And she's really happy and she feels really close to the people that she's around and they really have a family and they spend all their time together, you know. They went together and all bought a waterbed and play on the waterbed...just every time - they're a really close-knit thing now and I just feel very left out of that.</p> And, [silence from 0:59:04.2 to 0:59:16.5] and she's really happy, so.</p> And she also knows what she's doing this summer and things like that.</p> Right.</p> It's not also that she doesn't like me.</p> I mean because she, I mean it's not clear. I mean it's not like she doesn't like me - it's not like Diane.</p> But, she doesn't want to be close to me at all.</p> But just it shouldn't bother me so intensely but it does.</p> Yeah. (big sigh) I don't know. (making noise)</p> (making noise) [silence from 0:59:56.3 to 1:00:05.1] Well I don't know. [silence from 1:00:05.4 to 1:00:12.4]</p> And I can't...and somehow because I haven't made it here I don't feel free to start anywhere else, because it's not...but I know coming back, because it's all icky, I might just be perpetrating (ph) the ickiness. I might just make it worse and... </p> ...I'll keep on being stuck where it's icky and not be able to move away from it. And it seems like maybe I should just leave it.</p> You know, and some days I just really feel like, 'well I'm just not coming back to New York. I can really set up a life somewhere else. There's no reason I have to dwell in this thing that is making me unhappy.' You know? And there's no reason to do it again, you know? I've spent the whole year trying to get something that I never, trying - I'm looking for something I never found. You know and why come back again to try to find it and alienate yourself even more. Why don't I just like start all over someplace else?</p> Well but then...then again...something really nice happens. So I had a nice talk with Tricia. And I think, 'wow, Tricia is this really nice person and she's going to be here next year...and Marco is going to be here. And as long as Marco is somewhere it's worth being.'</p> And I certainly love him, right?</p> So, Jesus, maybe I'd be, could be Marco's friend. If I leave then I won't ever see him. I mean not that I won't ever see him but I'll hardly ever see him, our paths probably won't cross a lot. And then... </p> Well, okay. Okay.</p> I guess so.</p> I always do it in the middle of something. I never do right before. (chuckling)</p> Sure. When are you free?</p> Probably I was going to go downtown. Can I see you Thursday?</p> Is that too difficult?</p> Sure.</p>",2
1000076649.txt,"Well? Well, I don't know where to begin. You know, I don't even know how to begin.</p> I'm really angry at you. I'm angry at everyone. I just feel - I have all this shit piled on top of me; I can't stand it any more.</p> Probably hit people, throw things, swear, I don't know.</p> I really - the thing that I usually just do is step out away from it. I don't want to do that.</p> All right, do you want me to tell you what I'm all angry about?</p> All right. I'm just sort of angry at you, because I just feel like instead of - I just feel like I've got more responsibility once I got involved in this thing than I had before I went out. You read what I wrote in that thing. You know, I just got - trying that then I got really pissed off at you and I feel like there's all this added shit being piled on me. 0:02:10.2</p> Well, that thing you said about calling, but then I wouldn't call you.</p> What?</p> Yes. It's been like I was - that just really frightened me, sort of, really, really scared me, because then, you know, I figured I wouldn't know how to handle it, and secondly, I wouldn't - oh, God, I wouldn't know how to help [anyone with] (ph) their problems. If I can just sort of...</p> Well, can I finish? I want to go on more.</p> All right. And then I just - (Inaudible at 0:03:11.8). I have to stand up when I get really angry because I can't even... </p> (Cross talk) people when I... I just feel like, you know, like there's all this sort of stuff involved in - shit, I don't know. Like, well, I just feel like, all of a sudden, here it's like I'm just getting all involved in this thing I don't want to be in any more. I'm really scared, I want to get out of it, and I thought you - what you said was really stupid; I don't know why the hell you said it. I thought it took - you know, it was unfair advantage of the relationship, which, naturally, in sort of a therapy relationship, the client feels things for the therapist, because he's listening and stuff like that, and then you just sort of blew my mind at the end of the session. So I went home and had nothing to do but thing about it. 0:04:14.0</p> And it ruined... All week I felt like you ruined my whole week. You ruined my whole week Tuesday. Then on Wednesday that goddamn fucking school and my kids climb in, we were going to do improvisations, and no, they want to talk about sex. They were talking about - this is their improvisation: Three girls. They pulled this girl in who didn't want to talk about it and was - because this one girl kind of either had sex, intercourse over the weekend and it upset her, or someone found out, I don't know. All this shit. My master teacher was there looking at me, freaking out, they're all freaking out. I thought I was healing (ph) through. I think everybody is trying to make me what I'm not, and I think you are included, in trying to mold me to something that I'm not. I really don't like it. In fact, I can't stand it, and as I sit here I'm getting more and more furious. I think the whole thing is so absurd, and then I just felt today was like the last straw. And to have to think about what's going on in here, plus all the other shit I have to think about, it's not worth it, it's just not worth it.</p> No, I want something heavy (chuckling).</p> I can't throw it.</p> It doesn't mean anything now.</p> You're going to duck.</p> I am.</p> I've got one more box.</p> Again?</p> Well, I feel like an asshole, throwing the damn Kleenex box.</p> Seriously, I'm going to hit you another five minutes (inaudible at 0:06:33.3). All right?</p> I'm still really - you know, I'm angry. You know, I'm angry. It just seems everything I get into gets fucked up in some way that I'm just... ahhhh, like it's not worth the hassle.</p> Yeah.</p> Sure. Okay. </p> But you are.</p> It's not I'm afraid you are, right? You even said so last week. You have been at the game a lot longer than I have.</p> I'm sure I'll attempt it alone (ph). </p> Why did you say that thing about the phone?</p> How could you say that to someone at the end of the session? I mean how could you say that?</p> You know, I think that's really wrong, I mean to think that you wouldn't have any influence on someone. Any sort of interaction is influence, and especially this sort of interaction and influence, and a hell of a lot more than normal.</p> Well, it wasn't a - it just scared me, like there's some sort of closed-in feeling involved I didn't want anything to do with at all, but see, you didn't either, and I felt, you know, I didn't want to be pushative (ph) like that, and if there's some sort of therapy technique that that was involved with, I want to know what the hell it was.</p> Yeah, but I think that's - you know, of course. I don't see why not?</p> Probably.</p> But I still have a right to be angry at you for...</p> So I'm a technique (ph) to you, let me tell you.</p> See, I know I still have a different sort of perspective on it, you know, and I can follow you now, you know, but I mean I just think that I had a real right - oh shit, I don't know.</p> Oh yeah, right.</p> Yeah, really. I'm pissed at every - yeah. It's just that I didn't expect it from you, you know; anybody else, but not you.</p> Well, you were putting demands on me, goddamn it, just like everyone else.</p> Well, I thought - in the middle of the night you call with some fucking problem that I was supposed to handle and I'm screwed up enough by myself.</p> All right, but in my reality also, right?</p> No, I wouldn't - I would say true.</p> No, I wouldn't have mind that.</p> But I didn't (cross talk)</p> Oh geez. Well, wait a minute. I want to say something about it. Right from the beginning, like, I said to you, and I thought it was really abnormal on my part, but I don't think so now, when I consider the relationship, that I would feel something towards you.</p> So I don't see why the hell - so of course, like, I was sort of semi-wishing. Well, you know that, goddamn it. I already told you before.</p> Well, I didn't believe you.</p> Yeah, but I wouldn't open up to a man like I would with you to think about sex.</p> Oh Christ, who does right off the street with someone? You've been through it. Yeah, but you're the unusual one. </p> That's what makes you so attractive, but most people aren't like that. And you also could handle it when they all (ph) come back to you. Most people could handle it would say I opened up to them. [They become involved] (ph).</p> So you are unusual. So it's not just a regular relationship.</p> And so that did have more implication, and I think I had still every right, you know, to be - I'm not as angry now because I'm tightened (ph) now but... 0:18:19.6</p> Right.</p> (Inaudible at 0:20:43.1)</p> I don't care now if you like me or not, I really don't, so I don't think I'm worried about failing now.</p> We wouldn't (ph).</p> Well, I tried.</p> ""A"" for effort.</p> Well, why should - of course - yeah.</p> All right.</p> (Inaudible at 0:22:11.8) after that.</p> Split.</p> Panic.</p> Probably true. </p> Well, that's why I guess I say that I'm not (inaudible at 0:23:52.4) I came. I want it, I'm paying for it.</p> Gee, I should write a book about that, yeah. Yes, I do sometimes just hope - that feeling is just everyone is pressuring me to do things.</p> No, I don't want to go fast.</p> Why not?</p> It would be a volatile thing.</p> For you?</p> Right (laughing).</p> It isn't though.</p> That's really not fair to the client.</p> Well, what about the patient?</p> It wouldn't be for me. That would be the worst thing possible.</p> Because you would just sort of smell (ph) my ideas about a lot of things, like just in the bed; oh, helped her out, then jump out like she doesn't even mean anything. That would be ridiculous. You don't do that with a client. That's not what it is. 0:26:10.6</p> Well, it's someone that you care about for an hour because she pays you.</p> Fucking counseling service would lose my money.</p> Well, that's how the relationship was entered into, anyway.</p> I'm not sure I (chuckling)...</p> Yeah.</p> Got to have balls (ph). 0:28:04.9</p> Well, then, that's the real issue, isn't it?</p> Oh yeah, I know that.</p> All right.</p> [I know] (ph).</p> Yeah, I think so.</p> No, I agree with you. I just hope that I was really honest, sort of, in my feelings and I didn't...</p> But there's a difference in that I think you realize that this part would happen.</p> Yeah, I mean I think you would realize it, sort of, in that it has happened before, it must be in all the books already.</p> You don't? Good. That there would be some sort of attraction between prime patient [Winsberg Liza Beneveret] (ph). That might be another thing.</p> Yeah, but see, I felt guilty about it, kind of. 0:30:18.8</p> I  - </p> I'm not that. No, no, no, not that.</p> Because I thought that you were putting demands on me. </p> Well, that's just it. We went through it, because that's what I feel like. I feel like people putting demands on me. I feel like they're coming in, they're going to start asking me things. I mean you apparently sort of say yes. I feel (inaudible at 0:31:10.9) I feel that way. I don't, I really...</p> Yeah, I guess that would be it.</p> No. You know, I also never thought about like that step.</p> Of just running, if you wouldn't have to share them with anyone.</p> I guess I never thought of it in terms of like having such strong feelings. I just thought of sharing with someone crazy like I...</p> I don't think I [guess it very much in terms of] (ph) sharing.</p> Like I really don't think it's possible for me like that.</p> Fine, yeah.</p> All right.</p> Better. Good.</p> You are? I'm glad to see you, too. I was okay before I got in here. I just feel like kind of more screwed up all the time, so you know, like, that thing you gave me to look at? Well, I'm not going there. That was my first reaction; I'm not going there. I'm not even going to bother (inaudible at 0:35:09.2). I mean like it scared me.</p> I know.</p> But it's not until the end of April anyway.</p> A very what?</p> What is a garden variety...</p> I'm chauvinistic, right? </p> Yeah, go on.</p> You know...</p> Yeah.</p> You know, that's what I've done for my whole life: Delight people. I really think it's just unusual...</p> Because I show you I'm not that delightful person. How can you still like me? I bitch, I threw Kleenex wads and all that shit.</p> Well, you know that's because when I finally let go I don't know when to stop, like I make it like a Virginia Woolf sort of thing, you know. I mean I just really care, like I'm [a-leaving] (ph).</p> Yeah, and then I get shell-shocked and then I start crying and then I just feel so horribly guilty.</p> A complete asshole. Plus, I didn't let the other - my arrangements with the other person.</p> You do?</p> Oh, that's good. Last Friday it's just like really - see, that's the thing. You know, I find it - because I really like you. I find it hard to criticize you, you know, so I figure if I didn't write it down, like I wouldn't say anything about how pissed off I was and how furious I was last Friday, and I know that's a real problem. What I do is I build up frustration so they finally explode and I have all the reasons in the world to say I'm going to split, you know.</p> And the other person doesn't know what the hell she's leaving for.</p> And I know that, kind of. I know I do it, but I really don't know how to handle - so I decided I had to write that down, sort of, you know.</p> So that's why I wrote (inaudible at 0:39:21.6) because I just had to flip it off and throw (inaudible at 0:39:23.6) check the grammar.</p> Six  months ago you made a mistake, one mistake. Oh, boy, you're slipping.</p> Get out. Was it a big one?</p> Do you think you made a mistake last Friday?</p> You ruined my weekend. You, you, you (chuckling). You're guilty about it.</p> God, that's wonderful.</p> Do you have to have the responsibility sometimes? I mean like they're throwing piles of shit on top of you, like (inaudible at 0:40:53.7)?</p> Sure.</p> Oh God.</p> See, this morning was horrible like in that, you know, teaching. It was just ridic... First of all, I found the whole thing sort of absurd, but that's another thing. And secondly, you know, these kids came in, well, they're doing improvisations in class before going to drama, got this class, and the first thing they talked about, they wanted to have it being between two kids, one trying to get another one to smoke some grass. Well, they probably want to - see how I react to that. So I said, ""Fine, go ahead and do it.""</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And so then they said (chuckling)... What do I come across as, Susie Girl Scout?</p> Well, I must come across from yours, too, if you said something like that.</p> No.</p> No, I never have.</p> You're wrong (ph).</p> I mean I have a knife (ph), you know. </p> Right, and then I even thought about Howard (ph) girls and education (inaudible at 0:43:43.0).</p> That's two in six months.</p> Well, I was in the process about what you said, about the grass and stuff.</p> Well, it made me - it really pissed me off, because it's superficial (ph) judgment and...</p> Oh, you know, they don't. You see, I do that to myself. When I want to handle a situation I become like - oh, I just don't know what's going wrong, that sort of thing. I know I do it. I become a little girl, (kissing sound) and get yourself right out in the (inaudible at 0:44:54.4) of it. (Inaudible at 0:44:56.5) go out to lunch anyway.</p> But I haven't done that with you so that bothered me when you said that.</p> Gee, da (ph).</p> Yeah, I mean how often you don't get into it? Probably any party you go to. </p> I can imagine what this stereotype is, too.</p> Yeah. That's a very chauvinistic, too.</p> Yeah. I'm sure you can see the [long girls] (ph).</p> Pretty attracted to them in comparison to like a lot of the fourth students.</p> (Inaudible at 0:46:13.7) Not too bright. Yeah, not too bright. For a good time.</p> So you were wrong. 0:46:29.6</p> So you are human (chuckling). Well, for you. Going back for you after that... Another thing you did, you just sort of assumed that getting into drugs was getting into coolness, kind of, I thought.</p> I got from what you said.</p> All right. So what was I saying?</p> Oh, so I had this class. I had, you know, this woman, I can't stand her anyways, I just hate her, and she's the head director of my program and I don't like her at all. She's there and they said, we want to talk about something with you and Jennifer. I said, ""Fine, what is it?"" She says, ""Why can't these teachers, you know, let us live our own lives?"" And then they started saying, ""We were just talking in the hall about sleeping with our boyfriends,"" and the classroom teacher come in and they decided to talk to me and wanted to do an improvisation on this. 0:47:55.2</p> Yeah. This is improvisation class with my teacher sitting there just... Plus, they're talking about - can you imagine me, not even having sex with anyone, listening to all this stuff? That made me so...</p> Inadequate; you're not kidding. I just felt ridic - I felt, ""Oh, you are so out to lunch,"" and so I cannot take it, really.</p> Really. I'd try to go out and hire someone just so I can have a class tomorrow.</p> And so then they just - I didn't like chicken out. They want to discuss it, you know, and they want to see how I'm going to react, so I let them do their thing on it. And then this other girl, that I was worried about her because I didn't - well, then all of a sudden, I said what the hell are you doing in this classroom with these kids? You have enough problems of your own and it's a lot of bullshit if they even be up there handling... I don't know. I just got completely turned off by the whole thing.</p> What?</p> Well, they were definitely testing me out.</p> Yup.</p> Oh, I had such a - I don't know. That gestalt thing is such a mess. </p> True, true.</p> So the people I know?</p> Yeah.</p> How many people you want?</p> Six guys, six girls?</p> [Don't feed me] (ph) I'm scared kind of...</p> I'm scared of sort of group things.</p> Well, I handle it superficially; that's what - always I look really good kind of outwardly.</p> Sure I did.</p> Well, no, I didn't feel good inwardly, because it's a joke.</p> Yeah, I see it.</p> No, I can see it but like I - you know, like it's - well, it just goes hopey (ph) here is 15 year olds, you know, who going to bed is such an easy thing, and their asinine teacher is sitting out there and it's not an easy thing, you know. So it just sort of bothered me on top of everything else.</p> Are you kidding? It's the class distinction?</p> That's true there, but that's also rationalization, because look at everybody in my class. Just sleep around; that's very worthy. Well, anyone who I've ever liked, anyone... See, most people (ph) who haven't slept I can't stand. I mean, you know what they're like, those girls?</p> No, not that bad. You know, it just sort of really - completely out of it.</p> Maybe. (Inaudible at 0:53:51.1) give them a chance.</p> Yeah. It was just the whole thing was bad. Like she's there gawking at me, they're all bothering me, and you come in and you'll be gawking at me. I'm just sick of it. 0:54:10.6 </p> All right.</p> Maybe a little, yeah.</p> No.</p> No, no. I was going to be angry the whole time I was in here; I was determined to be that way, really.</p> Well, what if I don't like myself very much lately so [unless someone likes something in the afternoon...} (ph)</p> No, I'm not going to go out, you know, feeling like I have felt before.</p> You know, I don't' feel like there's all this pressure on me or responsibility. Not at all, um-umm. In other places maybe, but not from here.</p> Do I eat?</p> Right?</p> You mean do I eat correct foods?</p> Yeah.</p> Meat. I'm on a diet.</p> No, are you kidding me? I'm losing.</p> Because my waist is too big.</p> Oh really? You know, they're not supposed to be good for you.</p> Well, I heard...</p> All right, I mean like I guess a vitamin, one or two or three tablets, I mean all sorts of multivitamins, because you get too many. </p> Good Earth..</p> That's good, because it's like getting in touch with your body sort of stuff.</p> Right, that's how I feel.</p> Oh, what does 30 gram do for you?</p> Really?</p> Yeah.</p> Yup. What have you been eating?</p> Oh, what time?</p> That's not good, you know.</p> Because then you're on a full stomach at night. You should be eating...</p> Oh, all right. What do you eat?</p> Because I've been on chicken for about three days, just straight chicken.</p> Oh, you mean Stillman's (ph)?</p> No. I can't handle that too often, because I hate fruit.</p> See, you know, I have a thing also, Glen , that when I really don't like myself I have a tendency to eat like physically strong or something, I get really ugly kind of, you know. I mean I never gain like really a whole lot of weight. Sometimes I gain ten pounds, something do (ph) in there, but I stopped that.</p> Really?</p> I guess what's (inaudible at 1:01:02.1) it just seems like people can get so easily involved in relationships, and I find it very hard, you know. Like I don't get attracted to too many people. So then I - lately I've been thinking that that's my rationalization; I don't want to, but then sometimes I say, I don't know, because when I do, you know, things come fairly easily.</p> Really?</p> What if I had a bad one?</p> The knight in shining armor?</p> I can't think of any.</p> No, I've never thought there was very much advantage, honestly, but that was sort of intellectually I could say it. Emotionally I couldn't, you know, like give it up with it.</p> All right.</p>",2
1004687652.txt,"I'm sorry for not getting back to you quicker about tomorrow...</p> I just wanted to make sure that you can save it because I haven't heard.</p> I have very, very bad reception when I'm in my house in general...</p> ...so I fuckin' don't get texts or phone calls until much later. Like I'll get a message.</p> Yes!</p> Definitely.</p> It's just....like I won't get like the notification till much later, so I was doing it more to make sure that it was...</p> So. So, um...</p> Well (sighs), it's just been an exhausting few days now.</p> Mike's having such a really hard time with his addiction right now that it's just, um, that's pretty darn paralyzing cuz it's like part of it's the fact that (pause) (sighs)...and maybe it's just because I am...no, no, it's not just me. Um, I don't feel comfortable trying to be intimate with him if he's been acting out recently which just makes me feel very (inaudible at 00:01:22). So, but...ya know with all the stress that's been going on I really would like to gain some comfort from my husband but he's off somewhere else and so it's been, ya know, quite frustrating. [00:01:40]</p> So, I, um, yeah so I uh, like I said its made me pretty upset. (pause) And the thing is, is that it's just so exhausting getting to the truth of things...</p> ...that it's (sighs) (pause)...it's not even worth it. It's not worth the chase. Like I, back when I actually attended S-Anon meetings which were basically loved ones who have, ya know, someone in their lives with sexual addictions, there are women who are obsessed with chasing down every single detail of things. They want to know everything. I would like to know details. I really would. But not like at that level, and quite frankly the amount of effort that it takes for the minimal amount of insight it's just not worth it, ya know? And so (pause) I do have these sort of artificial preferences about things too and I feel kind of a bit of a jerk for wanting these things but like recently I was like ya know I really would like you to be sober around my birthday. That kind of thing. He's not very good at that. He wasn't even sober on our anniversary which sort of led to some very, very unpleasant things. If he had just been truthful the first time around on that it wouldn't...like I would have been like oh, oh I'm disappointed, that's a shame. But like the fact that it had to be like a oh, no, everything's fine ya know, and like I'm going to make you feel like you're going to...like you're the one's that's...every single thing that you think seems off is just you just overreacting or something...you're, you're, you're misplacing your concern on me. I think that's part of the reason why, by the way, that I always doubt my own judgment now is that I have been given by so many people um, between him and his family, the, the, the oh, you're sense of whatever is off, such that I get very, very...and I don't ever really truly know cuz sometimes I don't always find out what's true.</p> Ya know? And (sighs) (pause) it's frustrating.</p> Oh, I said to him like well, just because, just so I can lay it all to rest, do you mind if I just take a look at your computer. He's like well, actually I was. Sometimes he actually lets me use it cuz he thinks that I can't find out, and like there's no good reason why this much...I mean I don't look at like the programs. I know him well enough to know that he can clean up anything like that. All I have to do is see what the router data is coming in and out of it, ya know? Or I can look at the system log and find out like what processes at one point in time were being used. These are not things that he can erase per se. Um, but I...he just is honest with me at that point, ya know sort of. Um, at least mostly. But the thing is, is that like (sighs) (pause) that's exhausting ya know to have to get to that point of being told oh, no, everything's fine, don't worry, just relax. Ya know. Go take a nap. You're obviously just sort of...because I do talk about the fact that sometimes when I'm out and about that I sort of need a reset, like, because I have been...like especially when it's (pause)...the store is super manic cuz there's not...there's tons and tons of people and with completely and totally irrational expectations. Um (pause) that I do need a reset and I'm just sort of like I'm jumping at nothing at all, which is true. But very...I mean that isn't nor...that's tax free, that's day after Thanksgiving, that's when someone throws a phone at me. [00:05:52]</p> Yes. I can actually celebrate the anniversary but it's been a long time since I've actually had a phone thrown at me. It used to happen all the time. People get very frustrated when they're angry. Ya know, that kind of stuff, so (sighs).</p> Oh yeah. If you talk to anybody that's worked for Microsoft for more than 3 years they've had some small device thrown at them at some point.</p> Usually they miss cuz they're so upset that they don't, they're, they're not very...</p> ...yeah. But the point, though, is, is that it's the indignity...</p> ...of it all. Somebody who like...they're already...they already have a broken phone and you've just told them that it isn't just the glass. That like all the electronics under the glass has been bothered too. And they get angry and then they throw the phone at you. And so you have something that has broken glass thrown at you. Usually, like I said, by the time they get to that point they're so angry that they don't, they don't usually hit.</p> So, but yes, it gets to be that (inaudible at 00:07:02). Lots of during Christmas, (inaudible at 00:07:03) whatever, birthdays because you can't fix this, whatever, ya know. Yeah. So sometimes I need a reset from that cuz I mean it's a lot of fight or flight. But it's just the nature of the industry because we sort of propped ourself up to be the company that doesn't...you know that is wonderful customer service. Um, but (pause) ya know it's...but ya know it's, it's, it's very hard sometimes cuz it's like...ya know but I usually can reset by the time I get home. On the bus it's been...I've got this whole like, I've got this whole ritual of listening to music, doing something that's very detail oriented that I am very good at. It's like a self-reinforcing thing. Like, ya know, I, I, I've got a whole series of positive music along with, ya know, tasks that are not impossible, ya know, to do and that kind of thing. It usually resets me by the time I get home, so (pause)...almost all of us have some sort of thing for that. Back when I was in Cincinnati it was heavy drinking...not for me, but the people I knew. I'd go and hang with them. I, uh...I think that they do that at my store here, but I just don't have the interest of coming back later at night slash finding out how to get back from the surburbs at night after drinking to really know, whereas in Cincinnati we were literally in the middle of the city. We went to the bar that was right across from our store, ya know. And I could stumble home all of 700 feet to my apartment before...so it wasn't that big of a deal, but, um, it seems to be that it's a pretty common thing to have to do something to cope.</p> So...but...I mean that doesn't make us any different than air traffic controllers or...there's a lot of very high-stress jobs where people put a lot of pressure on you. It's not like it's (sighs)...you go into it with your eyes open. You know when you work there that you're going to deal with completely irrational people, and in many ways the store in Burlington is actually more sane than the old one. Um, now the thing is when I say sane—oh gosh, um—I should probably explain to you why it is that like, that like there's...I don't know, ya know. It's not even really relevant. But my old store was very, very (sigh) (pause)...due to the nature of it's proximity to other things we would get a lot more weirdos, but at the same time also we didn't have all the problems of the suburbs either, though. You never got somebody whose phone somehow got caught in the lawnmower. I have no idea how that happens to this day.</p> It happens in the summer time about once every other week that somebody got their phone in the lawnmower. Yeah. So (pause) I can't even fathom that one. In the city that doesn't happen so much cuz we don't really...</p> ...have lawns.</p> So, it's just really...I guess that it's really frustrating. I started at the beginning of my summer like distraction. Um, I think I've told you that I was thinking about trying to do the language thing again. Um, trying to learn a language.</p> Instead of trying to do one of the ones I failed at I think that I'm doing is I'm picking up one that I've never tried and one that I cannot feel bad because I don't know it if I fail at it because like if I try to pick up Russian, every member of my family can read and speak and all this other stuff. When I tried to pick up Greek, ya know, dad speaks it, but also just a lot of people, ya know, do that. Latin, same thing. And when I say I was a failure, I wasn't that bad. It was just not enough. Never attained enough. So I'm picking up Mandarin.</p> Which sounds hard but it's not as hard as you think. So (pause), so I'm gonna try and do some self-study and then I'm going to go try to visit this professor who teaches. There are two classes at the university. There is, there is an intensive beginning and then they have something called practical Mandarin which is I guess for people who are going abroad.</p> And it's more like how to recognize the word bathroom and things like that. Um (pause), which I've been told is actually very dangerous if I wanted to learn it as a skill long-term because you learn bad habits.</p> But I don't care. I just want...I just want to be able to if I go over there to have some sort of bearings. I don't know if I will or not, but it's something different. Something I can't compete with. There's nobody I know...actually that's not true. All the people I know who know Mandarin are (pause)...have a cultural link to it. Therefore, it's different, so we'll see how it goes. (pause) I don't have a metric to compare myself to and feel like a failure basically, and supposedly the actual language itself is a lot simpler than you'd think it would be cuz they have very...they don't have any um short vowels. Like it's always...the word Nikon is neekon, not nykon. They don't have a long ""i"" like that.</p> So, um, it's very short. It's very mechanical is the way you make words. It's just that lexicon is hard.</p> But it apparently is going to be going away in the past...I mean it's very rarely written any more.</p> It's like kids don't learn cursive any more.</p> And so there's a good chance that within the next 10 years it won't actually be in the, in the lexicon. So if I don't learn it...</p> ...it's not the end of the world.</p> So...that makes it a lot less difficult.</p> Yeah.</p> Which like you learn, like the symbol for bathroom and things like that it's more symbolic.</p> Like, but actually using it to write to somebody is very, very unusual any more.</p> So, but we'll see. I'm doing this not for credit, not...ya know doing this low stakes. We'll see how it goes. It might very well work. I am willing to like if come mid July I'm struggling, pull the plug and do something else. Usually I stick with it to be...to say that I finished cuz I don't like to be oh, I'm the person that finished, but sometimes I just feel like I just...I'm being a glutton for punishment and then sort of make myself feel bad about it.</p> But instead of yes-I-stuck-with-it-and-I-finished feeling, I get the wow, this totally confirms that I suck at this.</p> So, I, um...I'm not going to let myself, ya know, get into that belief and I'm not gonna tell...let anybody tell me right now about this, how what will and will not make me feel good and get accomplished cuz that's...I, I'm kind of...especially academically I feel like it's bullshit. I've always felt like it's bullshit. Like people can tell me what's going to give me satisfaction but they have no idea, and so if I'm doing it for my own edification then...</p> ...I'm just not gonna listen to it.</p> I'm...that's easier for me to go with my instincts on...</p> ...cuz I know myself very well.</p> Um, other things ya know, telling me oh, you'll feel better if you do this. Sometimes I get influenced too much, ya know? But we'll see. (sighs) I just (pause)...I need, just need something, ya know...not something to do cuz I have plenty to do. I need something that's gonna be (pause) more of an escapism from my world ya know? Something that's gonna be different. So (pause), so like I said...</p> I guess the word escapism, like escapism isn't quite the right word. I need a vacation from like...I need ya know a daily vacation from ya know worrying about my, my cares in my life and by jumping into that then I can go back into it, so...</p> Yeah.</p> It's my natural habit.</p> Yeah, when I had mentioned it to...I had e-mailed a couple friends about this, and they're like oh, just get the Pimsleur, and I'm like no, no, no, you don't understand...I will always find some...I understand...I, there's a lot of things I can self-pace myself through. This is not one of them. I may get the stuff, but I need to be in a classroom.</p> Ya know? I need to be like tonight's Mandarin night and I'm ya know gonna pack myself a lunch and go and leave the house no matter what drama's there. I mean it sounds lovely to go and get myself some tapes, but...</p> ...but I need, I need the, I need the interaction. So (pause) we'll see. We'll see how it goes. So...</p> I was shocked to find out that it was actually, that the class that is at the...there's a class and stuff at the university uh what's it called, uh...</p> Adult, yeah. Theirs is actually...their introduction one appears to be more difficult than the one that Yale has...not for the comprehensive but the basic survival skills.</p> Cuz their introductory one said that it would be very helpful if you'd had some sort of back...ya know that it was really geared toward...even though it was I, introductory I...</p> ...introductory I, if you had some background in this and I'm like no, actually. I know that the other type of rating that they have starts with the ""k"" other than [inaudible], but that's really about it. I know that books run the other direction because I used to read Manga but that's, I mean that's, that's the, that's like, that's like the maximum. So, I was just surprised that that was true. I don't know if they're just writing that to say that, but it appeared from the course description to be more difficult than the one that Yale had, which, like I said, really looks like you're spen...like it's made to be like you're spending the fall, ya know, doing at somebody's lab. This is how to make sure that you can find a taxi stand.</p> So, which ya know...it'll be...like I said it'll be helpful. The last language I took was so esoteric that it was very hard to get involved in. I took Latin. You don't really like...you don't learn the way you learn languages normally where you learn, ya know, normally. You spend a lot of time reading texts and so even with the first lesson you're reading (inaudible at 00:18:54) of some sort.</p> And so it's...at no point can I actually really say anything...</p> ...that's meaningful, like...</p> ...I can talk about dictators and like yeah.</p> So it's not a living...it never was a living language so, but so, but yeah...that's pretty much been the, ya know, I'm was just trying to keep myself going. It's just that I suck at it ya know? (pause)</p> Yeah. (pause) Well, it's not so much I suck at it as much as (pause) there are certain things that along the way that I find to be harder to deal with than others, so...I find certain situations more frustrating and more off putting than some other people do.</p> So (pause)...and they are usually things that I have to deal with more than the average person so like ya know doctor's offices that most healthy people don't have to go there that much. Therefore, the annoyance isn't all that common, so (pause) but (pause) I have to admit that I really don't know what else to say really.</p> Not much. Just exhaustion.</p> No, no I meant more like (pause) I'm not very good at the just-what—pops-in-one's-head kind of person cuz really it's just like wow, what pops into my head is boy I'm tired. That's really about it.</p> Yeah. But it's, it's not just that. It's just also like, like wow...I would really like to take a nap right now. Not just like pause for a minute but...</p> ...ya know like wow, ya know (pause). I'm just, ya know, I find my life boring and I don't know. (pause) It's very hard for me sometimes to find out what is relevant and what is not. Um...</p> What is important to share, what isn't. Like sometimes it's like wow, ya know I even find this to be kind of boring in terms of that, ya know? I find my despair to be very boring. (pause) Not that any, that there's anything that would liven it up per se or anything like that (pause). When I speak to other people I usually use a sense of levity that is a little bit, um, overdone because it makes it at least...first of all I try to make it short so it seems like it's not like I'm, ya know, trying to extract any sympathy but mostly just cuz it's like wow, ya know, this is really kind of depressing and boring, ya know? (pause) I do make a lot of jokes. (pause)</p> Because, ya know, it makes it seem at least more amusing and interesting. The other day I made a joke about...cuz people noticed I was limping, and it was like yup, if I have to get this hip replaced that means ya know that they...cuz at work if you have 3 major component replacements, which I've already had 2 joint replacements, they usually swap out the whole computer for a new one, and like they're just gonna...at that point they're just gonna give me a whole new body, ya know just like the, ya know.</p> Yeah. And that was a pretty big hit in terms of the jokes.</p> Yeah, but it made it more interesting than gee, ya know, it's gonna really suck if I have to get another, if I have to get another joint surgery and that kind of stuff. (pause)</p> Yeah, pretty much. Pretty much. Live for the past. (pause) The problem is, is that when you had such an amusing, extraordinary past and you have a very normal future it's sort of a (pause) it's hard sometimes to even just (pause) get acclimated to it. (pause) I find Christmas is a lot like brides who have like super big weddings and afterwards like they so they aren't the center of attention afterward and they're like so why am I so depressed. And like well, I don't think it's quite like that, but thanks for trying.</p> Just...I didn't really need to be the center of attention. It just was at least something interesting going on all the time (pause). The thing is, is that I know that if I went back and I spent more time over at Brown it isn't like that any more. The culture isn't like that any more either. I spent, I mean I've spent time there. They're still very dorkish but it's not...I mean there are two universities that they modeled after...for the story behind Weird Science, like and Brown was one of them. That isn't true any more. I mean they, they, they don't let you do the kind of things that we've done in the past.</p> Sorry Real Genius. I'm sorry, tired. I can't believe I got that one. Yeah. That's what I meant, Real Genius. Sorry. Yeah. Like the kind of things of like freezing things with liquid nitrogen and dropping them from staircases. They don't let you do that any more.</p> Um, but...so I know that that kind of stuff...and it's just...not that I really necessarily want to do it, but (pause) it's one of the many reasons why I don't like getting older. I don't like to admit that things are over. (pause) Hell, I just referenced an 80s movie (snorts) in terms of like things being over.</p> But, I don't know. (pause) And yes, my life sucks but it could be a lot worse. (pause) I really feel like on some level that why I let myself fall into despair. I can't dig myself out. Ya know? [00:28:38]</p> Dig myself out.</p> I just feel like when I get like that it's just not, ya know?</p> (Pause) I think that when I get that way I just let myself get too...I get kind of irrational and get very, like I said I mean everything makes me unhappy at that point ya know? I just (pause)...I just don't like that. And it's very, very hard to get out of it. Very hard. And so I just don't like to let myself get there because when I do it's impossible to get out.</p> It depends. (pause) Like I spent most of 2002 to 2003 feeling sorry for myself.</p> (Pause) I mean that isn't just the only time but when I do it just...I mean sometimes it takes days or whatever.</p> (pause) I make myself sick when I do that, ya know? Being upset bothers my stomach a lot.</p> So...</p> Oh, usually I get nauseated and throw up if I get really, really upset about something.</p> Not all the time but (pause) it does happen. (inaudible at 00:31:07) made the joke about...what was it she called it? Um, something bulimia. She made a joke about being like bulimia but you're not making the choices of it, like not really, but...</p> (pause) but it's just ya know, it was (pause)...I mean yes I found lots and lots of causes for it but basi...the concept is that I get sick, I get upset and then something happens and then like this perfect storm happens and the next thing you know I'm like at the hospital with colitis or something like that ya know? It only happens when I let myself get really, really stuck and wallowing. It isn't just like I...ya know I get, I get a little nauseous, it ends up being like some sort of digestive...</p> ...ugliness, yeah.</p> So, I'm not really sure what that's about, but there's definitely a component of distress associated with it, so...</p> Yeah. They tested me actually a couple times for that.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Because of the fact that my immune system tends to be very - they call it rheumatoid arthritis but it tends to sometimes branch out and does other things it, it, it mimics a lot of symptoms like Crohns. Sometimes I've gotten symptoms like many other things also.</p> But for me...there are other symptoms that happen sometimes but the biggest thing that really happens is that I have never been able to tolerate being nauseous very well and so (pause) that's the one where basically for me it's very crippling.</p> So that's, yeah, that's why I don't really like to let myself get that upset about anything. (pause) It's really hard when like your emotions create something like this, something that is actually...like I said it's not the only thing that created this, but it creates something that's very real too. It isn't just like well I have an upset stomach. No, I'm ending up like (inaudible at 00:34:16) consumer like when they're doing some sort of CT scan kind of thing ya know. It isn't just like, ya know...it, it, it is very...</p> No.</p> I have (inaudible at 00:34:33) of horror throwing up before too but not like that.</p> Yeah. This is more like, ya know, even after the time passes we were upset about something it's still, there's a lot of repercussions. So, it just...that isn't the only thing that's happened, but that's the one that...it's like my serious weakness. All of my life I've never been very good with that. I don't...I don't deal with it very well. And so...not that there's many people in the world who like this kind of thing, but...</p> No.</p> But, it's something that...I have...day to day I can handle chronic pain, and there are people who have like IBS and other things like and digestive things and they can handle it. It's not something that I have the coping skills to do.</p> So (pause)...</p> So it's just (pause) amongst many other things ya know, but this is just like (pause)...it's many, there's many things in life that really force me to not really want to be that sad.</p> Valid ones, ya know? (noise) I think she's snoring. So (pause)...</p> I don't know.</p> Probably the entire time since between now and December 1st, 1999.</p> At 11 AM. That's when I found out that, for the first time that I figured out what was going on kind of. It just doesn't ever really go away. If I let myself I'll just despair. (pause) Maybe I'm just being dramatic by saying it's been like that the whole time, but I'm pretty sure that if I just let myself like be, like literally yeah if I let myself the entire time I probably would have gone to reset.</p> (pause) There are certain things in life that understanding it doesn't make it any easier to keep going. Like understanding my arthritis has made it slightly easier to keep going cuz it's like I understand why when I wake up in the morning that, ya know, sometimes I'm in a lot of pain. It's like while over the night, ya know, that like it been collecting. Your immune system tends not to work when you're awake. It tends to work when you're asleep, so I know that my immune system is busy tearing my body apart while I'm sleeping.</p> That kind of knowledge is actually helpful.</p> Um, the more that I know and understand about my husband's addiction doesn't really make it that much easier to keep going.</p> I want to but I just don't know. I mean I do keep going but it doesn't make it...the inside doesn't change anything, ya know?</p> (pause) I'm really starting to despair of whether or not he can actually ever really recover from this either. Ya know?</p> (pause) Oh well. He's a good man. He really doesn't deserve this.</p> Yeah. (pause) But at least I had a foundation where (pause) I knew that I was loved and supported, that kind of thing. (pause) If I get angry around the house he is immediately thinks that I angered him. Like I spilled something at one point...well while up on a ladder I spilled something all over myself. I'm flipping out, ya know. He's trying to help. I'm saying no, no, no, you leave it alone, this and this, and then he's like ya know I'm really kind of bitter that, ya know, I'm really kind of resentful that you spilled something on yourself and you took it out on me...and not just took it out on me but that you're angry with me about it. And I said that makes no sense at all. How in the world is it that like I'm angry. I wanted, you know I needed to take care of the situation because it would have spilled and it was going to stain really bad and I needed to take care of the situation but in no way was I angry at you. That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Ya know?</p> And on top of it like him being angry and also he's resentful because he felt like he didn't do anything wrong. I'm like I'm...this doesn't make...like where did we get to that point, and how many times that I've been frustrated with something and like you thought I was mad at you. This is the equivalent of stubbing one's toe and starting to swear ya know. It's not...it's, it's 30 seconds later you're fine. I'm just angry cuz I'm covered in ya know whatever.</p> And (pause) I feel like it's awful that he (pause) ya know feels that way about things, but he always has. I have seen it happen over again, ya know, with our nephew. Sometimes I hear about it and realize it's happening over again with them too. It's like they're just convenient punching bags. That's so sad.</p> Ya know? It makes me want to call up my sister-in-law and yell at her about things. (pause) I, most of the things that I heard, though, it's like it's really none of my business to yell at her about, but I find it disturbing that, ya know, her 9- or 10-year-old son has to look to his younger or older sister to tell him what he's feeling. That's really creepy. And on top of it just to reinforce that, she has her 10-year-old son sharing a bedroom with their 9-year-old daughter so that she can bully him.</p> And...she has the space. She just doesn't want to...the other room is...like she has a 4-bedroom house.</p> But one of them is filled with junk right now and it's kind of inconvenient to have to clean up.</p> So they've been sharing rooms for a long time now.</p> Like doesn't that seem a little bit weird? Yeah. He didn't speak until his older sister went to school because...they thought there was something wrong. They did all this testing.</p> He just needed actually to have some peace and quiet from his sister who talked all the time, ya know? And, and it's just, it's like everything I hear about what's going on over there makes me think to myself my God, this is like scarily mirroring what we've suspected with Mike.</p> Ya know? Right down to the fact that his sister lives in the house that he grew up in. His mother gave his sister the house.</p> Which is a sense of resentment by the way. Um, so like Aiden is living in Mike's bedroom that he grew up as a child in, ya know?</p> Yeah. It's just...and he doesn't remember a damn thing really but if you connect the dots it just looks really bad. It looks really bad. But nobody wants to actually...we can't get any external confirmation...</p> ...therefore it feels very awkward to, ya know? They're all like...they're actually willing to admit that he doesn't remember anything but like that's such a strange phenomenon. I wonder why that is, ya know?</p> Okay. I will see you Tuesday?</p> Yes. I do not have my schedule and stuff with me...</p> Yeah, let's do it on Tuesday.</p>",2
1004687646.txt,"Like a month and a half ago. </p> And I wanted to know if they were still available on your schedule. </p> Um, I'm also taking a class in the fall and I don't remember if it's...</p> ...Wednesday or if it's Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday. </p> So I'll have to find out. </p> Yeah, um because it would finish at like 5:30. </p> Right. </p> Okay. </p> Alright. (pause) So, I don't know, I've been thinking about a bunch of things. </p> Um, (pause) so one of them um...so my friend Zoe um is (inaudible at 00:02:24].5) was uh in a...there was a fire in her apartment. </p> I think I told you that. </p> So, um the other thing is that I really, really hate Zoe's boyfriend. </p> Yeah. Um, and so somehow—I can't remember—like somehow her crappy boyfriend came up and also I was talking to some friends and like also that she had been in this fire—uh, one of my friends was like oh, you didn't, ya know...you didn't tell me. I didn't know about this. (inaudible at 00:03:04].7) met Zoe before. And when I was telling about it, I'm like wow. I really hate her boyfriend. Um, and I think one of the reasons why is that I can't like...it's almost impossible for me to see her and not see him. So, and I'm not entirely sure like...so last time I visited her was, ya know, was a while ago, 4 years ago, and it was partially his. I was just so angry at him for...like I was (inaudible [00:03:52].5) like in a vague way and then I got in on Sunday morning, like he was already drinking and you know like 10, and also pretty clearly had been like, probably like sneaking drinks. So on Friday we I think Zoe purchased a 6-pack of beer. She's like oh yeah (inaudible [00:04:19].1) some and I purchased a 6-pack for her as well, and then Sunday morning they were down to like 4 beers. I'm like I had 1 or 2, Zoe had 1 or 2 and what the fuck. And she said yeah, he often drinks some wine with like (inaudible [00:04:38].6). Um, and so that was kind of intense conversation. Well, at first I was like, I was trying to do...(inaudible [00:04:46].8) was like needing to leave right now or I'm gonna kill your boyfriend. (inaudible [00:04:52].6) around and then (inaudible [00:04:57].9) I was just trying to be calm but I can't believe he's drinking in the morning like it's just normal. He sucks. And her thing was is that she felt like she couldn't break up with him because they'd been together too long. Like if she ever broke up with him, like, ya know, (inaudible at 00:05:18].4) and now it was too late. And she also said it was really hard and people ragged on him because like she felt (inaudible [00:05:31].0) about it and didn't know so I told her that I would, ya know, try not to insult her boyfriend. Um, and after the fire uh, he was like very...he felt very guilty for not having gone for a fire extinguisher which he saw and thought about but didn't...like I think he would have had to either walk past what was burning or like...it was kind of weird, but he saw the extinguisher but didn't use it and felt really bad about it. </p> Yeah, so...</p> Yeah. What did happen is that the fire alarm went off. He got up and looked in the halls to see what the heck was going on and was like oh, I see a fire. Like and he also I guess saw the fire at the end of the hall...I mean the fire extinguisher at the end of the hall. And what he did is that he basically yelled for her to get up and then sort of ran down the stairs. </p> Yeah, so she's like...</p> I don't think she had woken up. She sleeps really, really heavily. Um, so he gets to the door and he yelled, and then she came after him and I think he was like maybe like a half a flight of stairs ahead of her and so she's burned over her back and her hair caught on fire and he was barely burned. He had very minor burns. He was just further ahead of her. Um, and I also (inaudible at 00:07:23].8) like get her out of bed. Like, when she was telling me...or her parents told me, and then she was telling me...I'm kinda like why. It sounds like he saw a fire, told you and ran. And didn't like...I don't know, grab you. Like I understand the situation but I would be saying like you're an asshole. Why didn't you grab your girlfriend? Especially since you know that she's sleep heavily and like all these things. Um, and he was like oh, I should have gone for the fire extinguisher blah, blah, blah, and Zoe had said that she didn't want to talk about like what he could or could not have done because it already happened. So she said, ya know...she said I don't want to listen to him angst about it and you can say whatever. I don't want to rehash of what happened. I'm like, alright. Like that seems fair. Um, but I was talking to her recently and she's gonna go to a conference for (inaudible [00:08:35].7) virus and so we were kind of talking about things that she could do, like it's in the area so she was asking me about it, and it just made me really angry like all over again. I hate your boyfriend. And I can never...I haven't talked to her or seen her as much because he's always there. Like he visits her family at Christmas and Thanksgiving. Um, and (inaudible [00:09:15].7) she's there, he's there. Um, but I try to be like oh, you're in the City for a day trip. He always wants to come with her. And like one time...I had convinced her to do it one time and he still came with her. Like she stayed in a motel with me but he stayed with one of his cousins. And I just feel like I can never just...like I just want to see her and it's hard in general to (inaudible [00:09:48].6) your boyfriend, but I'm also like I don't understand why you're attached at the hip when you agreed he's kind of a jerk. So she, you know me, (inaudible [00:09:59].0), her family does a trip every summer like so she's with me right now and uh, so she was like oh, so I'm going to be coming up and seeing you. But I'm pretty sure that it's going to be her and her boyfriend (inaudible at 00:10:18].0). Like community visit. (sighs) I actually haven't...I don't...I haven't seen her boyfriend since the fire, so I think maybe he wasn't there the last Christmas. I just (inaudible [00:10:30].8). (sighs) It just (pause) like I hadn't really thought about how we, I don't know, have been a little more distant. Or I...like you know she used to be like definitely my best friend, be my closest friend. She's been (inaudible [00:11:01].3) the longest. Um, and we're both bad at keeping in touch, but as I was thinking about it I was thinking like what part of the issue is that. But I also want to see my friends in person and I don't like calling as much and I find seeing her in person super frustrating. Like, I don't know. And also what depresses me is that I think she's probably at this point...because she (inaudible [00:11:34].8) cigarette burns she's probably not gonna break up with him. Like she said one reason she doesn't break up with him is she's like, ya know, dating's so hard, blah, blah, blah. Maybe I should work on the relationship I already have cuz I won't be able to find a new one. And I think that felt that she's not...she says she's not attractive enough, so I feel like having severe burns is not like, she's gonna not want to date even more. </p> Yeah.</p> Even though like...ya know, I don't know. Like they're not visible when she's dressed. </p> Um, but like (inaudible [00:12:34].5) boyfriend, so. </p> (sighs) (pause) </p> Yeah. I don't know. Like (pause) I think...I mean I'm like well...I mean...I sort of feel like I feel stuck because I don't think there is any work to go with that. </p> I mean, it does. Also with um (inaudible [00:14:32].9) Elliott that I dated for quite a long time. </p> And at the end of our relationship like probably for 2 years I had this well, I was like well I know I don't want to get married and I don't want to have kids with you.</p> And I don't like the longer we date the more that (pause)...I don't know I felt like the longer we were dating the more it seemed like we should be doing something to go to the next level and doing something. </p> Also, um, he's like 10 years older than I am. So when I was dating him he was, ya know, much more at the stage of wanting to like his friends had kids...</p> ...ya know, etcetera, and I'm just like I'm not doing that. </p> And yet...although he never pressured me about it. Um, there was this really like weird moment where...so he's Jewish, not religious, his parents are Jewish, not religious...but they really wanted him to marry someone who's Jewish, and out of nowhere his dad told him that he could get married to me even though I wasn't Jewish. I don't know it was just like, wait! (laughs) (inaudible [00:15:59].8) would be his reaction as well...</p> ...cuz it's like they were like, ya know, (inaudible [00:16:03].5) agrees getting on the bus cuz helps (inaudible [00:16:09].8).</p> Um, yeah, I was like well, good, but...</p> ...oh God. </p> I know! (pause) It was just really, I mean it was really just weird. </p> And also he has two younger brothers. </p> And I'm like his parents have given up on them (laughs). </p> Ya know? Like, um, yeah it was...and I just...they made it (inaudible [00:16:41].1) and I was like alright, that sounds like...I feel like a wedding is slowly being arranged around me. </p> Ya know? </p> Um, and so...</p> And it was really hard. Um, cuz I had dated him for like 8 years. </p> It was a weird breakup in that I kind of processed it (inaudible [00:17:24].8) and then told him. </p> So, and...I don't know. Like I really sort of...and I said a lot of like (inaudible [00:17:39].6) reasons. I don't want to talk to you for 6 months. Or I don't remember, it was like a chunk of time because I thought like...I thought we needed a break, the habit of talking to each other and being (inaudible [00:17:54].5).</p> No, but I spent like sometimes weekends at his house.</p> And like we just spent the weekend together. </p> And ya know (inaudible [00:18:10].5) reminds me a lot of Elliott. It's just that (sighs) I think...my friends are kind of like why are you dating this guy? Well he's an okay guy but like, what are you doing?</p> I'm like well, I don't know. And I felt like I didn't have a good reason to break up with him. Like it's my fault ya know. Mm...like I like him but there are things he does that annoy me but ya know (pause) I mean like riding to work when he would...if I told him he had upset me he would say I'm sorry, I'm sorry, and work really hard to fix it for a month and then go right back to being (inaudible [00:18:59].7).</p> Um, (inaudible [00:19:02].5) I had done this and let me tell you he's not going to stop and it sucks. You just need to...</p> ...go. Um, (pause) yeah, also just kind of weird to me that like in general, ya know, she's a smart, intelligent, together woman and she's like her career...</p> ...she's like perfectly...(inaudible [00:19:45].9) exerting control and control like, ya know, making decisions (inaudible [00:19:52].5) do whatever. But it...like with her boyfriend it's just...I don't know. She just doesn't (pause). She's just really stuck like, which is like (inaudible at 00:20:08].3) is that while she's advancing in all these other things—her career, her life and her other things—she's sort of stuck in this weird rut with her boyfriend. And I knew that emotions don't work like that. Ya know this is sort of like, like you are this smart, intelligent, awesome, successful woman and you're boyfriend's a loser who doesn't have a job and still just (inaudible [00:20:37].5) his parents and takes her money and is an alcoholic and all these other things. Um, I feel like, I think I know a...probably like a dozen women that are my age who are these awesome, successful women with really crappy boyfriends and husbands. </p> I want to say why?</p> Like why are you?</p> Yeah! And like they even acknowledge that their husband or their partner's kind of crappy but they're like well, but (pause) ya know he does that or he's this. </p> Yeah! And like (pause) I mean ya know it's not (inaudible at 00:21:39].0) it's just ya know...I don't really know. Like I'm painfully aware of that, but (pause) (sighs). Like I really...I mean when I (inaudible [00:21:59].8) which is not like possible is to know what is the thing that (inaudible [00:22:07].3) this relationship (inaudible at 00:22:08].4). Like is there something I could do that would like...I don't even know. </p> Right. Or be like no, I'd totally help you move out or find a partner, just like I'm like what is the barrier, a barrier that I can do something about. Um, when in reality it's like...I mean it's not about her finding a place or any of those things. Because, ya know, she has the money, ya know, to afford an apartment, um, etcetera, etcetera. Like it's not all the structural stuff. It's whatever (inaudible [00:22:53].6) with him. (pause) It's also my least favorite couple, uh, one of my least favorite couple of things is when someone is in a relationship and you can't see what one sees in the other. Like because that doesn't always apply (inaudible [00:23:33].0)...</p> ...and like...I don't know. For some reason like it's not (inaudible [00:23:44].2) and I find it slightly creepy because I feel like why can't you separate. It's like (inaudible at 00:23:54].7) I don't. You are separate people. </p> I don't always want to talk to you as a unit. </p> Yeah. (pause) And I also, like I don't (pause)...I just do not feel great about kind of pulling back because she's in this relationship. Um, but there was a time when like she could use an extra friend...</p> ...and...I don't know. Like I just...I didn't really decide it but I just haven't...I just always have like 3 reasons and an excuse why I haven't called or haven't whatever. And when we do talk what's funny is it always feels like—and not because (inaudible at 00:26:34].3)—it just always feels like I just talked to her. It feels very, I don't know, like I don't feel like oh, I haven't talked to you in a year. It's like oh, blah, blah, blah. </p> Yeah. </p> Um, the only drawback would be just (inaudible at 00:26:54].8) in January or February. I was trying to talk to her about possible layoffs and she said like well, (inaudible at 00:27:07].9) the devil's advocate. I mean it's not probably going to happen and etcetera, etcetera. And I was really upset. I don't care. I don't like devil's advocate game...</p> Um, and I realize it's like oh, I think that either she's forgotten that I hate devil's advocate game. Like we haven't talked enough in a while that like...</p> ...either you kind of forgotten that or we're not picking up each other's like conversational signals, whatever. Um, (inaudible at 00:27:55].7) (A) really upset that (inaudible [00:27:59].7). I was upset that my friend...I feel like she was blowing me off in saying like...</p> ...(inaudible at 00:28:04].2) and crazy and I was like fuck! Should be better friends than to have this kind of a communication and pratfall. </p> Um, (inaudible at 00:28:20].8) not want to talk to her again. </p> Um, which is also frustrating. Like I've been thinking like I should call her, I should call her for the last couple of weeks. So it's kind (inaudible at 00:28:33].5) also it reminded me that (inaudible at 00:28:42].2) was very nice except the hard part that I don't want to see you with the boyfriend. (pause) </p> Yeah. </p> Right. </p> No, it's (inaudible at 00:29:49].6) pissed. Like I'm, like upset. </p> And partly I don't know. And part of it is sort of having a repetitive conversation of your boyfriend really sucks. Yes he does. Okay, I don't...</p> (inaudible at 00:30:06].6). I don't know really what else to...like I don't know like I'm tired of if you agree that he sucks, then I don't know. Like I'm like...do I not....like I feel like I sort of want my friend to stop complaining or stop agreeing or something. </p> I don't know. It's just...it's just so...having a conversation with someone about how their partner is crappy and then having...and with her partner like attached to her hip for 2 hours. It just feels (pause)...it's just like a classic mistake and it sounds like you just said that your angry at how he's a jerk and now we're going to spend 3 hours with him silently on the sofa right next to you. Like can I have one or the other (inaudible at 00:31:23].7). I don't know. I feel kind of weirdly, sometimes really drawn into some kind of...like are they just (inaudible at 00:31:34].3) and then like kind of that and then just go back to their partner. Like I feel like...</p> Like I'm really involved in this kind of weird tangential way. </p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. </p> I mean it does also make me think about I mean how a couple friends asked afterwards like if they had done anything would it have helped and I think the answer is probably not. </p> Like (pause) I wasn't going to get out of that because someone else said this really sucks. </p> Um, like he was really good here afterwards...</p> ...but like I don't think (inaudible at 00:32:52].9) the other way or it wouldn't have (inaudible at 00:32:59].1). So that's frustrating to sort of like want to be like blah, blah, blah except I'm pretty sure it won't do anything, and I think yeah why it won't do anything but (pause)...</p> Not at all. It did...I don't know...2 years ago a...I've done two speed-dating events which ended one it was no (inaudible [00:33:59].3) and one sort of (pause) there were (inaudible [00:34:08].9) like we were going (inaudible at 00:34:08].8)</p> Um, yeah. And it sort of didn't really go romantically or sexually but it did go like you're awesome, which, ya know (pause) </p> No, I'm like...I don't...I don't think about it a lot. Like I do sometimes but I don't like spend time (inaudible at 00:35:03].2).</p> Um, you just want to get occasionally like (inaudible at 00:35:13].0) I would want to do a partner. I'm like hmm. It would be nice to be with someone but like (inaudible at 00:35:25].8). But I don't like...I don't sit around feeling bad about it. Um, I probably do sit around sometimes thinking...I mean not fearing...am I feeling okay not dating because I'm too scared to date (inaudible at 00:35:53].0). Like I feel like shouldn't I feel...</p> Right. I think part of it's cuz Ashby is so obsessed with dating someone... </p> ...that periodically I'm like, I don't know. I really don't feel that way...at all. But I've never felt that way. I don't even...like not since high school. And I was acting like oh my God I have to be dating someone. I have to get married. I have to...</p> I'm a failure if I'm not dating someone. (pause) </p> I don't know. Like it feels more like I'm just (inaudible at 00:37:47].3). Um, the one thing I do (inaudible at 00:37:59].4) is I'm like mmm, um I haven't been...I just haven't gone to um like (inaudible at 00:38:07].4) parties or things like that in a while and actually (inaudible [00:38:17].2) and I haven't really played at them either and it's sort like mmm...I mean I like sex, so I guess sometimes I question myself like why aren't you going out and getting some casual sex if you wanted to? But like I don't...I don't want to say I don't really feel like it. I mean definitely, I definitely had a...like very strongly felt for a while that I was really scared of dating again...</p> ...and it's just...it's, ya know (inaudible [00:39:00].5)</p> Yeah. If they just (inaudible at 00:39:07].6). And I don't feel that way. Like I don't feel scared so much as...I don't know...I guess it's not really a life...it's not really a goal. I guess if that makes sense. So some people I know really like (inaudible at 00:39:42].3). They really are just like I want to do this. It's really important. </p> And I want to say mm. </p> (inaudible at 00:39:49].5)</p> And I feel that way...I mean it's not the way I want (inaudible at 00:40:04].2) like I don't feel like I totally...if I die unmarried that's fine. </p> Um, the only thing like I think about right now is I kind of want... there's another theme of wanting a kid and I'm like wow, we're getting kind of...eggs are getting old. We're just kind of like being (inaudible at 00:40:28].0) being an old parent. </p> Um, but I don't want a kid right now. Like...</p> I'm like I'm (inaudible at 00:40:39].9) right now but what kind of frustrates me is I'm like, so it's like it's slightly time related regardless of how I feel about it. There's just a point where it's like well, (inaudible [00:40:53].5). And I'm kind of upset about that but I also don't want to go have a baby. </p> Like a couple people I know has been (inaudible [00:41:12].3) single parenthood, which is fine. Um, I really don't know. And I think I in some ways would be not as happy but I would be totally satisfied if like my brothers might have kids and I was able to be their aunt...like if I shared a house with like a friend of the kids that that would be very satisfying. (inaudible at 00:41:51].6) I want to experience being pregnant and having (inaudible at 00:42:01].8) a child but, then you'd have a kid. </p> Yeah and I was like oh that's stupid. I can't do anything with it. </p>",2
1003269450.txt,"Thought you said videotape.</p> No, do you know (inaudible 0:00:06.5), I was like oh, okay, okay, okay.</p> Right. It is just to review and whatever, yes.</p> Yes, yes no problem.</p> Then you will know that is fine.</p> Yes, well I am from Chicago and I am living on 17th Street.</p> Yes, it is kind of an interesting story, I can tell you. It is part of the reason why I am here.</p> I have been living in Portugal, Lisbon for the past year and a half.</p> Yes, I was working actually in finance. Well, I am one of those people I never - I didn't know what I wanted to do out of college. So I started - tried a couple of things, whatever. I wound up landing a pretty good job at HSBC. I am not - I knew I probably was not the finance type.</p> But it seemed like a good opportunity to try it, so I did. I did not like it immediately. So about a year later I decided, okay. I do not know why, but I wanted to move to Seattle. I had been there a few times. I fell in love with the city.</p> I was actually planning on transferring that job that I hated to Seattle just to get there whatever. I mentioned it to a friend. She was kind of in a weird position. She could not find a job. She is a lawyer. I would - we just spoke about moving there and then randomly we spoke about moving to Portugal. It was just random, random, random. We wound up realizing we could go there and teach English make a living whatever.</p> And so basically we did not really plan it very much. It was kind of just we found this program, we could do a teaching English Foreign language thing. Got a job through them. It sounded really good, so we just went for it.</p> This is a friend from high school.</p> Yes, and we did that, and before we were concerned about the whole visa issue, because you can only really stay in Europe three months without a visa and then it is an issue. So we asked the school and kind of they told us, once you get here we can work it out, blah, blah, blah. So we are great, perfect.</p> They did not.</p> So I think you know where this is ultimately going, so yes so we went. By August, this was April of today. I do not even know what year, 2007, 2006.</p> By August of the same year my friend was kind of like I want to be a lawyer. I am sick of teaching. I do not like it, I want to leave. I felt completely opposite. I was like I really like teaching. I just discovered this.</p> I really love Portugal. I love being in a different place where I am learning different things, our cultures and, blah, blah, blah. I want to stay. So at that point it was like I decide either I am staying by myself, and trying to really work it out here or I am going home, try to get a visa and I have only been there for four-ish months so the chances of me going home, and then coming back after I already started making a little -</p> No.</p> Yes, but that was the thing, it was I can either go home, and work this out legally.</p> Or -</p> Exactly and there might be a problem. So and everyone always said, I mean, it is stupid. I mean, I am old enough to know that you should not really listen to it what other people are saying whatever. But it really was not an issue for Americans. These people would come in and out of the country years, and years, and never get stopped, and I believed it. I wanted to believe it more than anything, you know?</p> And so I never did. I never did that. I wound up getting a job at this English academy. They also said oh yes, your visa you can get your visa. So I was great, six months to a year, fine. I am going to be here. So spring rolls around this past year, and I was like I had to ask for some reason I just checked up on the progress of it, and the director of the school said, ""Oh they denied the visa."" This really weird, shady kind of guy so I kind of think he might have been lying the whole time and whatever.</p> So that was that. At the same time that this happened I had, okay. I also had besides this job a private client base. There was really this one guy I had since the beginning who referred me yes.</p> Yes, yes that who referred me all these other private clients, which was great.</p> Teaching.</p> So they liked me I think, because I had an understanding of -</p> Yes and so he refers me this guy who I meet at the same time the director tell me I do not have the visa, who is my age. I immediately was just okay. Something can happen with this - something could possibly happen, you just knew.</p> And put in like a holding area. It was not a jail but I mean, it is the closest I have ever been to jail.</p> So I like to say it was jail with all these other people who were illegal, and stopped or for whatever reason they were detained, and I had to stay overnight and then was sent back here. Yes and I do not know, my boyfriend he is very, very rational and I am very, very emotional.</p> Just generally speaking.</p> No, I neglected to tell him that, but he was not angry. The thing is that he is really understanding, and I probably would have been really angry with him for not telling me, and all this, but it was not an issue.</p> Yes, and I mean, for the first three days I was not hysterical, but on the verge of tears at every second. Anything made me cry, I could barely function.</p> Oh God, what is today? Today is Wednesday.</p> Okay. So last Wednesday.</p> Yes.</p> So last Wednesday at this time I was in the immigrants holding area and then I was sent back Thursday morning. So yes, so it is one week and right now I mean, I would say since about Sunday-ish I have been so much better to the point where I am -</p> I do not know, should I really talk to someone about this, because you know sometimes you call people, because you are in such a panic state. And then once you feel better sometimes you are I do not know if I really need it. But it is not just this situation. There are others that I think I over react in, and there have been many others.</p> And then there are just other things that I - other ways that I react to other situations, not as catastrophic, but I just do not think it is a, I do not know.</p> It is positive, but it is not helping, and it is really, it is hurting the people around me, and it hurts me more than anyone.</p> Fernão.His name is Justino (ph?). It is like a really --</p> Yes, it really old school accent too, yes.</p> Yes, oh yes. Sorry forgot to mention that. So I am not allowed back into Portugal until November 1st.</p> Yes.</p> I do. I can go back (inaudible 0:09:17.5).</p> I know because at first...</p> The lady, the policewoman that she told me, because she was telling me in English so I was just I can not deal with this in Portuguese.</p> I am sorry, and she was just her English was not perfect. She was like, ""You can never come back to Portugal."" And then there was a pause until November because (laughter) her English was not great. And I was (inaudible 0:09:43.6) (laughter) (inaudible 0:09:41.70).</p> They banned me from the country and I lost everything that was important. You know like, everything.</p> That is another - that was another source of stress and sadness or whatever, is that first of all, the visa process is not easy. And it is not the easiest process regardless.</p> The easiest thing for me to do, well, the easiest in terms of not having to pay and, blah, blah, blah, would be if I could find some (inaudible 0:10:22.0) school to sponsor me, but while I am here it is difficult, because I cannot go there interview. I cannot whatever, so I have my boyfriend and the student who referred me there to kind of helping me try to look into options there.</p> If you do not have a certain amount of money.</p> And the other issue there is my parents do not have a lot - do not have money. And I mean, they have - I do not know. They really do not. They have nothing and I do not know that they are going to be able to even show - even if they say to me, look we will help you out but we cannot pay for the school aid. We will write the letter stating we have -</p> Enough money. I do not even think they have money in the bank to do it.</p> So it is the other issue that is like oh. Another issue is that my boyfriend he is really wonderful. He is everything I ever wanted in a person. Really, I cannot I mean, he is amazing. For me he is just perfect but he has a family problem. He comes from a family a very traditional, conservative strict Roman Catholic family.</p> Yes, I mean, they will not even let him (inaudible 0:12:33.5)</p> Yes.</p> Yes, I think it is.</p> Right. The thing is -</p> Yes, I mean, now I am thinking I am beating myself, beating myself, beating myself up over the fact that I am not there right now. We had such a wonderful three weeks together. He stayed in my apartment.</p> That was great. And then if I went back, we would not even be able to see each other. I probably would be working until nine o'clock every night, which I was doing last year, and he cannot even stay out.</p> The thing was we started dating at the end of June, beginning of July. He had just finished law school there. He was taking the bare equivalent to the Bar Exam, and so he was studying everyday. I did not realize that they allowed him - he was allowed to stay out all night, because they thought he was studying.</p> But that was really why and then the parents have a summer home, and they were there the rest of July, so they did not know what he was doing. And I mean, the thing is he is trying to figure out a way to - well he is trying to figure out what he wants to do.</p> Maybe but it is so up in the air.</p> Here is the thing, it is easier - I think it might be easier for him even just to do a study in English program.</p> It would be great because his English is great, but he could certainly improve it.</p> I think work visas, yes and then they kind of have to give it to you. Any work visa unless you cannot financially, whatever and then he can whatever, but yes in getting work visas to go anywhere is extremely difficult. But anyway, yes so that is the issue and -</p> I would like to work on, well -</p> Yes.</p> The thing is I want to work on my reaction to situations like this, because my immediate reaction is so excessive. And although I do feel like it is justified in some ways depending upon the situation, it is still excessive. The carrying on, the crying, the calling people nonstop because I am like desperate to talk.</p> And a little bit more traumatic, yes.</p> Well, not often. The thing is not often but -</p> No. I mean, whenever anything life changing happens. I would say like break up with a boyfriend. I do not know. A lot of times it is like if I am forced to do something, it is not even though. I was going to say if I am forced to do something I do not want to do, but it is not, because I have to do things I do not want to do a lot.</p> Yes, exactly being able to cope with...</p> Yes, or even for example I am lucky enough to not have experience a death in my family of a close family member. But if I did, I do not know. I mean, I am not sure I would be able to cope with it, and unfortunately it is something that just happens in life, and although difficult, and I cannot even image it happening. It is -</p> Going to happen.</p> So -</p> Yes. It is random because -</p> In the past I had this therapist that I used to go to.</p> But she is very, very, very expensive, and she was in my health insurance plan at one point. The thing is I cannot, she is $300 an hour or something.</p> Insane. She is wonderful but, and she had once suggested me that I contact this institute for another reason. I think it was a family issue or something a while ago. So I just randomly looked just to see, and I just saw the Rational Motor Behavioral Therapy and I was like oh my God, this is wonderful.</p> It is like this is it and so it was exactly what I feel like I need.</p> Yes.</p> Yes, it is kind of interesting, but it was boyfriend related.</p> The first time I think I was around 20, 21.</p> That was almost ten years ago. It is scary, yes. Yes.</p> Yes.</p> No, I was not seeing, he was the only one.</p> Well, I guess yes then more recently. I guess the last time was about two years - it was when I was working at HSBC, and I had this awful, awful boss.</p> Just awful everyday and I could not ended up - I was having difficulty coping and then crying all the time. And so I started seeing her, and she actually took my insurance at the time so.</p> Yes, so.</p> Never homework assignments. Maybe assignments like try to think about this when you are in a situation that, type of thing.</p> More back and forth. More me talking as I tend to dominate the conversation anyway whether you like it or not. But yes, a little bit back and forth kind like how we have been.</p> Going so far.</p> Yes.</p> Yes.</p> Right.</p> Right.</p> Yes.</p> Yes, no me too.</p> Okay.</p> Okay.</p>",0
1004798835.txt,"When I saw you on Monday I said I was going to try not to talk to Franklin and see him this week. I went home and I had a conversation with my friend, Jennifer, the friend who has gone through this similar thing but to a more extreme extent with the physical cheating and all this stuff. I was talking a lot about how I was trying not to talk him. He's making me feel guilty. She's like, ""What has he done in terms of what your terms were for making this work?"" and I'm like, ""Honestly, nothing that I've seen."" She was like, ""Maybe you need to tell him then that you're just literally not going to talk to him, not respond to him, until he shows you that he's done some of this stuff."" I was like, ""Oh, ehhh,"" and she was like, ""I know, it's hard and it's scary because what if he's like, 'Nah, nevermind,"" or whatever. She's like, ""But, honestly, you need to take care of yourself and you're way too concerned about how he's feeling and all this stuff,"" similar to what we were talking about. [00:01:02 So then I went to dinner with some girlfriends, which was really nice, and then I went home. I called him for some reason. I had had some wine and I called him for whatever reason. I don't know; just to be nice because I felt bad for him. He was kind of like . . . I don't remember exactly the conversation, but I got into talking about how I hadn't really seen him do these things that he said he was going to do and this whole therapy thing means a lot to me because I really want to talk about issues that I can't talk to him about that haven't worked for us and whatever. He kind of started making me feel guilty like it's only been this amount of time, even though last week it's already been a month and you're still thinking about this, so that when it's him it's ""only"" been a month and ""I've been doing so much and I've been trying so hard and I'm thinking about so many things. It's so hard to find a therapist and I don't have time. I can only call during my lunch break or after work hours and they're closed after work hours. I've been moving and I've been doing all of this stuff."" [00:02:00] I'm like, ""Yeah, I know. I've been there the whole time with you doing it also."" I was like, ""I really don't think it's a lot to expect. These were my terms."" I don't remember then. He was just kind of getting on me trying to bully me down from my soapbox, basically, and at one point said, ""How about this, Trina. I'm not going to talk to you for a while. I'm not going to answer your calls or your texts. I just can't do this."" I was like, ""Excuse me?"" And I do remember saying this. I was like, ""How about this. I'm not going to talk to you for a while. I'm not going to answer your calls or your texts. I'm not the one that messed up in this situation. You are."" He was like, ""Well, fine. So what did you drink with your friends at dinner?"" I was like, ""No. I haven't."" Of course, I had, but I wasn't about to tell him about it. He was like, ""Well, fine then, and hopefully the next time that I talk to you I can have some of these things done that you want me to have done."" I was like, ""Yeah. Me, too. Yeah, I know."" (sniggers) [00:03:08] So then Tuesday night I went with my friend, Jillian, to her son's football practice and just sat in the bleachers and chatted with her and that was good. Then I don't think I texted him at all. Maybe I texted him goodnight. I literally am addicted, like can't not do it, feel like I don't know what's driving me, right? Then the next day I had open house, my big annual opening event, big reception with music and catering and the whole thing, so I was very busy the whole day. I was leaving for the night and had a text from him. Meanwhile, I'm struggling, suffering like, ""I miss him. I feel bad."" I have a text from him saying, ""Are you home? Wait, nevermind,"" and then whatever. I called him and was like, ""What did you need?"" He had wanted to pick up the phone case that came in the mail for him which I had left on the front porch in the flowerpot. He got that. And drop off the keys that the cat sitter had used over the weekend that she gave to him because she's on his crew, his dance crew. [00:04:09] So he dropped off the keys. I guess he brought them upstairs and put them inside. I texted him and he was like, ""How was open house?"" and I didn't talk to him for very long; then I texted him in the morning. I sent him a picture of the cats. I don't know. They were being cute and they're still his cats, too. So I sent him a picture of the cats and I was like, ""The cats are having a good day."" Whatever. I probably should have not done that. And also a lot of what my friend Jennifer was like, ""You're kind of rewarding him when he hasn't done anything. You're rewarding him by letting him see you, letting him talk to you, letting him have you there in his life; and he hasn't really done anything to show you that he deserves that."" I was doing that again. But, anyway, last night I had class and I went home. I was feeling really sad and I was talking to my mom on the phone. I was just feeling really sad. I missed him and I just wished stuff hadn't gotten all messed up and was feeling sad that he also, even though I said I wouldn't respond to him, he's now texting me like, ""Hey, I did this today,"" or ""Hey, hope you're well. Have a good day,"" like, ""You're the one that should be pursuing me, so I was feeling bad about that. Then all night I was dreaming about—there was a scenario and it was Franklin and there was another girl there and my friends were there telling me to stop talking to him. I don't remember what the circumstance was, but it was not pleasant and it was just more of the same frustrations. Like, ""Why are you talking to that girl?"" I don't know. I woke up feeling less bad than I was last night and more irritated and confident in my resolve that this is not working right now. I opened his Facebook to see a post that said, ""Ugh."" Something like, ""Note to self. Reminder to self. Don't celebrate reaching a goal with booze on a Thursday night when you know you have work early in the morning."" And here's what made me mad, not only because he's sitting around boozing celebrating some reaching a goal. [00:06:05] I promise you reaching that goal, whatever he's talking about, was some move that he probably got in break-dancing. Okay, everybody has their right to their own little celebrations of whatever, but it frustrated me because I made this big point and I want him to be working on all of this stuff and he's there boozing and celebrating, doing something with dance. He's not telling me—instead of a text coming like, ""Hey, by the way, I found my therapist,"" or whatever. It made me feel like I didn't need to be talking to him right now if this is how he's going to treat it. He's clearly like this is not on the forefront in terms of how to fix things with me. Like what the fuck? Now I don't even feel bad at all and I'm glad to not be talking to him because it would just be frustrating and I don't know what's going to happen and when I'm going to talk to him next right now. . It made me feel like I didn't need to be talking to him right now if this is how he's going to treat it. He's clearly like this is not on the forefront in terms of how to fix things with me. Like what the fuck? Now I don't even feel bad at all and I'm glad to not be talking to him because it would just be frustrating and I don't know what's going to happen and when I'm going to talk to him next right now. [00:06:57]</p> That he put the posting? This morning. I didn't talk to him last night. Last night I had been feeling so sad—poor Franklin—and I didn't talk to him at all yesterday, night or during the day or today at all, and I'm not planning to. (pause) </p> Yes. And myself. (pause) I've been trying to . . . There have been so many instances of . . . I've been dealing for so long with him convincing me that my feelings aren't exactly what they are or that I'm looking at things differently than anybody else would and having different reactions than anybody else would; and, therefore, I'm more dramatic and over the top. I'm kind of having a hard time getting out of that, but I feel justified, like I'm not making a bigger deal out of stuff. [00:08:09] Even the posting, Franklin, you shouldn't be doing that on Facebook. You're not even sending me text messages saying this, that and the other. You're not saving the money that you need to pay the $800 to get back into school because of the class you failed. Instead you're spending $300 on a Playstation and booze or whatever else you're doing. What are you doing? It upsets me and it hurts my feelings, but I think it makes me more angry than anything because here I've put all this emotion and effort and he's talking about how sad he is and how he comes home and cries and I'm his best friend and he lost his best friend and blah, blah, blah. Okay, so where's the effort of the stuff that even if you don't really want to do it, you know that it's important to me in our relationship and you want to be in a relationship so badly with me—so why aren't you doing these things? [00:09:03] It's like I don't understand. And it's like what am I making an effort for then at all? ""It's so hard to find a therapist. It's so hard to call the Health Insurance and ask them to send me a list of people that are in my network. It's so hard."" I don't think that's hard. (pause) I think I was expecting him to step up to the plate, but it just doesn't seem like he's doing that right now. It's making me not really care—not making me not care, but . . . (sighs) [00:10:02] It's also making me feel like, God, if I'm not there pushing him along he's just going to do whatever; and I don't want to have somebody like that for the rest of my life as my partner. I want you doing stuff that's self-motivated. I don't know. And also I've said, ""Here I am. I've started classes. I have all this schoolwork. I'm making plans with friends and reaching out to friends. I'm helping friends and doing this. I'm working. I did this big event. I'm doing all this shit and he's boozing because he got some move in his club probably."" I can almost promise you—I've known him long enough and I know him well enough to know that ""reaching a goal"" wasn't getting back into school. Like, ""I'm sure that wasn't the goal you're talking about. Was it getting a certain amount of light from your fucking stupid page with your fucking photography?"" Shit. I was feeling pretty proud of myself when I was at home and I was like, ""God, I planned that whole, damn event, I got an ""A"" in my course over the summer, I'm already doing well in this class and enjoying it and my professor likes me and I'm posting on the discussion boards and I'm planning all of this stuff and I'm dealing with all of this stuff. And then he's like so 'I can't do anything because I moved and I work nine to five at a helpdesk,'"" not planning anything, just taking tickets and not logistically planning anything at work or in my life or taking classes or going to therapy. (pause) [00:11:57] I also feel like we're in a game of who's going to call who first? It obviously should be him, if anybody is going to call anybody. He should even be calling me, texting me, and I shouldn't be responding. That should be happening right now in my mind. Like, ""You should be telling me what you've been doing and showing me that you've been making an effort."" (pause) (sighs) [00:12:57] [It's usually him not really knowing what to feel or think about this I think.] (inaudible at 00:13:02) (pause) There I am, sitting at home, worried, thinking, ""Is he sad? What's he doing? Is he [ ]?"" (inaudible at 00:13:26) and he's at a club boozing and dancing with his friends. And I'm sitting home thinking that because this is what he told me, that he comes home and cries. Going back thinking, again, it's very characteristic of how it's been, this whole situation and our whole relationship. I'm just trying to get by. Day to day just trying to deal. [00:13:56]</p> Yeah. That was one of the things I was talking about with Jennifer. She was like, ""I know that you're not ready to walk away from this relationship yet. I know that. You're not, but you do need to do something drastic to kind of shake this up and make it clear that this is serious."" She advised me to do that, but to not make the mistake that she made which was take him back three times, thinking that she could do something differently even if he wasn't changing too much. ""That's one thing I'll tell you—maybe try this and see what happens and it's scary. You don't have to walk away yet, but don't give him a bunch of chances. Don't let him come to you in two weeks and say, 'I've done all this and I think I'm better,' and take him back; and then stuff falls into the same patterns."" [00:15:05] Then I brought up how maybe I am making it too serious. He didn't physically cheat as far as I know. She was like, ""Trina, it doesn't matter. He was talking in a way for an extended period of time to a woman that made you feel uncomfortable and that was inappropriate. Maybe he wasn't feeling emotionally attached to her, but he was still emotionally cheating on you even if he wasn't physically cheating on you. He was talking to another woman. Don't make it less than it is because he tries to."" Like, ""I didn't cheat on you. What are you talking about—emotional cheating?"" That's what he would say to me. I was like, ""It is, Franklin."" (pause) Yeah, it is hopeless, but to the same extent I feel like that situation—I do feel a little helpless because there's nothing I've been able to say or do that is going to make him act differently. [00:16:17] (pause) </p> Yeah. I do have a hard time 100 percent looking at things or at a situation from my own point of view. I do tend to look at it from other peoples' ways of thinking about it or something and what they say. Maybe that's because . . . I don't know. My point of view is kind of ""You're an asshole and I love you, but I will never marry you."" That's kind of maybe why I'm looking at other peoples' because even the ones that are saying, ""You should leave him,"" at least I can be okay with them saying that because it's like, ""Well, yeah, but you obviously know that I have to make that decision for myself."" So it's okay for them to say that; but then for me, honestly, I am at the point where this is a total wash. There's nothing here to work with anymore. It's really painful. I love him and I miss him and I did want to talk to him every night this week and maybe see him, too. But it's really stressful and I don't want to give myself an ulcer. [00:20:39] He's not giving me anything to work with, so the way that I look at it is that if you're not giving me anything to work with, then I've literally given you all that I have in this relationship and even in this breakup or separation. And I don't feel that reciprocated and if I continue to not feel that reciprocated, that's it. I can't do anything anymore. I think that's a hard decision to be moving towards, I guess, for me. I guess I was feeling more emotional about it during the week and then I'm thinking about the fact that he hasn't been texting me or making an effort to tell me things that he's been doing. Then this whole thing this morning with his stupid Facebook post about being hung over like, ""What am I stressing over saving right now? You don't really seem like you're stressing over saving anything."" [00:21:58] Whatever. He may be having more of the thoughts he's having, but he's not showing me anything. He's not coming through on these things that I said were important and that would allow us to think about still having a future. I think I was hoping for more, expecting more out of him. He's disappointed me so far so, yeah, I don't know what to say. (pause) If he does send me a message like, ""I'm in therapy. I hope you're well,"" how do I react to that? I don't know. [00:23:03] I'm really not expecting a message like that to come through [ ]. (inaudible at 00:23:06) Maybe he'll surprise me. Jennifer is like, ""I promise. He'll come crawling back. Jerry still calls me all the time begging to see me."" I'm like, ""Okay, but after how long?"" This whole situation is not what I wanted. (sniggers) I don't think anybody would want it, but I never wanted to deal with the situation of somebody having to crawl back to me. (pause) I guess I just don't really know how I feel about him overall or how to react. [00:24:13]</p> In terms of not knowing how to?</p> (pause) I guess the idea of being single and not having to worry about stuff. I have to say I've been enjoying being able to go to bed whenever I want without somebody being like, ""You're going to bed so early?"" or having the TV on and turning the lights off when I want. In the mornings just being able to do my thing, whether I'm running late or not, and not have somebody kind of like, ""What are you doing? Why are you doing that?"" [00:25:10] I'm doing that quite a bit. Also being able to go and do whatever I want, like after work just on the fly going to the football game with Jillian and not having to explain to anybody or change any plans with anybody or anything. The idea of that more long-term comes to mind, but then the idea of missing him and missing out on birthdays and holidays together, hanging out with him and stuff. I'm almost getting used to it right now, I think. But then you know when I said that's just not me—hanging out. How many times have I been so irritated with him dominating conversations with his ridiculous theories on things? How irritated that would make me and dealing with drinking too much and, ""Let's get wine."" ""No, no. I don't wine."" ""Ohhh."" He makes me feel like I'm a party pooper. Going to things that he wants to go to that I might not feel as comfortable at and feeling guilty if I don't go and him making me feel like I'm a party pooper if I don't go. That's stuff that I really hate about being with him. So when I look at that stuff, it's like, ""Maybe I can find somebody that stuff isn't like that and someone that does look better on paper, too."" Stuff like that. Thinking about options in that regard (sighs) (pause) [00:27:13] I do have some struggles but . . . I'm going out tonight and tomorrow night with some girlfriends, two different groups of girls, and going to places where we want to dress nice and there are drinks and people and music. It's really nice and not be worried about somebody asking what time I'm going to be home and feeling pressure or guilt like, ""I'm just going to stay in then,"" because he did that a lot and I would feel guilty about going out with my friends and I really don't think, I should. I'm still young. I should be able to go out until three if I want. He does, too, but he always makes me feel like, ""When are you coming home?"" If I would come home drunk he'd be annoyed. [00:28:11] I don't want to deal with that and I'm happy to not have to this weekend. It's like the first weekend I don't have to ever deal with that. If I want to stay over at my friend's, it's fine. The money thing, too. I'm still catching up a little bit with my finances and I don't have a ton of extra money right now, but just not having to worry about somebody else's finances, just worry about my own. Go out for a $50 dinner at with my friends and have two bottles of wine with them and not have it affect ""our"" budget. Next time around—if there's a next time around with somebody—I'm definitely not moving in with them until I'm almost engaged to them. Even then, I'm not sharing my finances with anybody until I get married. Lesson learned in both of those situations. [00:29:12] It's too much, too fast, and yeah, that won't happen again. In the meantime, it's nice to have my own finances back and not have groceries at the house if I don't want to have groceries at the house and get take-out every night this week if I want which I haven't, but I could. Although I got two parking tickets yesterday and that was frustrating. There is a parking ticket for Franklin and then I got two other parking tickets. I'm literally paying the city's street-cleaning bill this month or something. Obviously not. I got two parking tickets yesterday and that was frustrating, but I have to brush it off. It was a stupid mistake on my part the first time. I forgot to bump the meter. The second time I misread the sign, so it was three after six instead of after eight. That was dumb. But, ehh, it's my problem. (chuckles) That's great. It's my problem; it's not somebody else getting tickets. [00:30:31] I don't even think he has any idea of how to manage finances on his own. Clearly, not if he's [ ] spending all this money. He even has his credit card bill linked to my bank account because it was our bank account. It's a Capital One with a $300 limit on it, and so he has $300 and I promise you it's still sitting on there. I promise you he hasn't paid it yet. I took my account off of there immediately. Am I wrong, though? I don't know. Again, I think I was feeling sad about it all week and then this morning I woke up after having those dreams that made me annoyed and seeing his annoying not-progressive post, now I don't feel sad as much as just, ""Fuck it. Let me just fucking wait and see if he fucking calls me or something. I can't be bothered right now."" Yeah, I'm sure that it's . . . See, here I go. I was literally about to say, ""Yeah, I'm sure that is going to make him feel sad."" [00:31:30] Okay, I'm sure it will. It makes me feel sad, but why do I even need to worry about that or think about that or say that? It's my problem. I really can't walk away from that inclination. Maybe in time I will, but right now I really am trying to work hard at not having my mind wrapped around how he might feel about this or what he might think about me not talking to him. I need to worry about myself. I been doing all of this stuff for everybody—for work, for him, for the house, for all of this stuff. What have I done for me? I am doing more. Obviously I'm going out with my friends as I mentioned and I think it's especially important right now to keep busy. I'm finding that at home it's a little more difficult. [00:32:30]</p> Yeah. Maybe I will have to move at some point.</p> Yeah. We moved in there together and had almost our entire relationship in that apartment, so I'll see. I like my apartment, I really do. But sometimes when I'm home I'm just thinking about it, just sitting around. I will have to figure out if I continue to feel this bad then, yeah, maybe I should think about finding a new place on my own and starting fresh on my own at some point. I'm not quite ready for that, but it would be good. We'll see if we end. I'm sure I'll want to text him, but I'm just going to try to stay busy and if I feel like calling or texting him, maybe just calling or texting a friend instead. I'll be interested to see if he texts me at all this weekend or tries to call me. I'll try not to pick up the call or respond to the text message, but I am curious to see if he will reach out. Even if he does, though, it's not going to be saying something, I'm sure, that can convince me that he's working on stuff. Maybe it will be nice, but . . . [00:34:09] I guess it's kind of like lesson learned. Earlier this week when I was texting him and calling him it was me, not him. I was like, ""Wait a second. I'm the one not talking to him. Stick with it."" (sighs) I guess it's just a difficult period that I'm trying to manage the best I can, and I've been doing pretty good. I do think I'm doing pretty well. I'm just staying distracted. I just want to kind of get a better handle on my reactions to things and how I'm feeling with things, and not rely so much on thinking what other people's opinions or people's thoughts about it—more relying on my own feelings and instincts, I think, is important, too. (pause) [00:35:20] Do you have any opinions? (laughs)</p> Definitely more so than last week or earlier this week, I think. (pause) I guess I'm seeing things a little bit more for how they are. I see by you, that I'm not talking to you and you're not doing anything, that I see how that's helping me. There will be digging out of that sense of denial that I have about how things are and how they could be and how they were and how they might be and seeing it for how it is and dealing with that, as opposed to looking at how it was in the past or how it could be in the future. [00:36:32] That was a big problem I was having, so I feel that's a good thing. I'm just finding that distractions are very key for me right now and I think that's in with the whole taking care of myself area.</p> Yeah. Staying out and doing stuff that I've wanted to do but maybe have been hesitant to follow up on.</p> Yeah, they're just things that I would be doing in a normal life; but it's acting as a distraction because it's not stuff that I've been doing as frequently before when I was with Franklin, as I am now. I'll go out every night of the week if I want to or need to. </p> Yeah, exactly. So that's helpful as well.</p> Yeah, and with the cats and stuff. My roommate is nice and we've had a couple of conversations and she seems cool, although she asked me if I could unplug my air freshener because she has allergies to strong fragrances. Ugh. I did it. It's fine. I was like, ""My house doesn't smell with it."" (laughs) It's one of those things, you know. But, yeah, it is difficult so I'm going to have to think about that as an option. If I want to move, I can. (pause) </p> It's helpful to have the support of my friends and be able to come here and talk about things. People don't understand. They think therapy is like this big ""thing,"" when really it can just be as simple as helpful to just talk to a third party. People think it's this big ""I don't want to be in therapy,"" more like gut serious. (sighs) It should be a fine weekend and I have plenty to do at work and schoolwork next week. </p> In terms of things to do? [00:39:18]</p> I don't know. Honestly, I was thinking about maybe buying a new pair of shoes to wear out this weekend. </p> I don't know. Some new high heels, maybe. I haven't really worn high heels in a while. I thought it might be nice. I'm getting my hair cut next week, which is always nice. I'm looking forward to that.</p> Yeah, thinking about choosing an outfit based on how I want to look and how I want to feel, as opposed to how he might want me to look or might like me to look or how I might look with him—out of place with people that he knows. It's a really different way of thinking about it and it's more fun. I'm like, ""I can just buy something."" [00:41:05]</p> Maybe. Yeah, maybe, because I was always very conscious of how I would look around the people that he hangs out with and maybe try to dress a little bit more in that style. Also, he would like me to wear some things that I really didn't like on myself, but I would do it because he liked it. Yeah, I think I will be a little bit more—I don't know. Maybe a little bit more older. Like maybe buying a whole new outfit to go out one night just because I want to because I want to look cute and not it being, ""Why are you buying a whole outfit? You've got lots of clothes"" Maybe wearing lower-cut shirts. (chuckles) I don't know. Spending more time on my hair and makeup, being more conscious of my accessories, being more conscious of being out with my single girlfriends and maybe wanting to look cuter so we're the ""cute"" group of girls. A lot. I am. It does have a lot to do with it, thinking about being out there again. I'm looking forward to it for this weekend, at least. I have nice plans.</p>",0
1004798821.txt,"I'm feeling really overwhelmed and tired. [Pause]. I've been waking up between like 4:00 and 5:00 like every single night for like four weeks now. </p> And sometimes it lasts for like five or ten minutes and then sometimes it lasts for like two hours...what happened last night. And I think it is the SSRI...at least that's what my psychiatrist thinks. </p> Now I'm taking Zoloft. [Pause]. So that's what the fatigue is. I'm overwhelmed because I don't like the distracting and sort of tiring process of taking medication and adjusting to it and thinking about whether it's useful or...[pause]...even like noticing little things that make you feel like you're taking medication. Like the little brain twitches. [Pause].</p> You talked about dreams being interesting to you. I've sort of had like a dream this whole time too. I've sort of been trying to keep track of them, but so I need to know what about the dreams would be helpful to talk about because any kind of writing, documentation activity right before or after sleeping is not really compatible with like how late I am always and how tired I am. So if you could maybe give me some guidelines as to what aspect of the dreams are...</p> So like...okay. So I've dreamt about therapy three times in the last week and dreamt about tons of other stuff too, but this is the first time that therapy has come up in my dreams and I couldn't remember the second dream was, but the latest dream, which was last night was that my parents and my brother came with me, which was very cute and not surprising. </p> Yeah, but I kind of like it. Like I still look forward to coming here and I still...I think I'm crying because I'm tired. I'm not like feeling...[pause]...well, whatever. So I like the; I like the intensive aspect of my own like insights and your insights and the exploration that happens. And I don't know. It's like fascinating and I'm like asking all these people inappropriate questions about their therapy because I'm just like really curious about it. </p> I said how is your session with Rachel today, and he said it was good. And he usually doesn't say it was good. He usually says, ""It was okay."" Or he'll tell me a specific insight that he thought was interesting or weird or something. So I just; I should have stopped there in his eyes. Then I was like, ""What was good about it?"" He said, ""If I have something to tell you then I will, but I'm not going to be as open as you are."" And I said, ""Well, to be honest, I'm just super curious about therapy right now. I don't actually feel like prying actually. Like I don't need to know because I love you and I need to know what's happening in your therapy. It's just like you're a person in therapy that I talk to, so I want to know what's happening in your therapy."" </p> For my understanding. She did tell me. That was useful. Or comforting. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, there isn't too much. I show that I love these people in other ways. I don't have to know what they talk about in therapy.</p> And I brought it up to Linda exactly as that. </p> Well, because it's sort of this like strange experience and no one really talks about it.</p> And Linda is a great person to talk to because she...she treats most things as an objective study and it's so nice to just hear her analysis of anything she's been through in her life. Sort of maybe the way that people might experience talking to me. I think I do the same thing, but she's a religion student and obviously writes and reads an awful lot, so she's got this cool literary way of talking about all of this. So I knew that asking her about something like this would...that I would just get a whole lot...like a structured argument; an analysis and that sort of...I was just looking for some...another person's impression of the phenomenon. [Pause].</p> The confidence is a really different...in a really different place, so I'm really comfortable and confident about my own ability to be introspective even if you say things that I've never thought about before. So I feel like I can communicate extremely free in here.</p> Aside from that, yeah, I guess it's...jazz rehearsal, I can sort of like forget after it's over. [Pause] </p> Yes, so I can't really forget therapy. That's what I meant about it being totalizing. [Pause.] </p> Yeah, and just the potential. Not necessarily exactly what is said, but they do stick with me. Just like when I was watching The Wire, I talked all day about the characters in The Wire, and I just finished a book yesterday and miss it very dearly and think about what happens next. I've gotten pretty attached to people and their stories. So it's not unusual for me to be thinking about my interpersonal relationships a lot. But more than that, it's the...it sort of feels like a grand stage and I don't really mean that in the performative way, but more like this like theater where it's like a super set of all the other things they do in my life. So it encompasses everything, or it could. [Pause].</p> Because we could talk about anything here. [Pause].</p> Yeah, like Sarah and my mom did it all. Linda got it, but she's got more similarities...way more than I did. Between her and my mother, I've been just sticking to the edge. [Pause]. </p> Uh huh. Um [pause].</p> Well, I guess it's sort of like how I...how things become important to me like when I started meditation, that was like all I could talk about, and I read a bunch about it and I told everybody about it and I asked them stuff ...[pause]...besides present as new, as my latest thing. And maybe this is sort of become that in a way. And that happens with everything, with swimming and like painting pots. I started painting my terracotta pots a couple of weeks ago and I was looking for my own creative activity and...so it's sort of an unfamiliar feeling to be really like honing in on this and getting it a lot of weight and importance. </p> Yeah. No, it doesn't. But clearly this is very different. [Pause]. </p> But it doesn't feel like an activity. [Pause]. Like a recreational activity or...it does feel like an enrichment. [Pause]. Enrichment but I think it takes a lot of emotional energy. [Pause]. </p> Yeah. </p> Uh huh. It's also kind of [pause]...it's kind of exhilarating because it's always sort of a surprise what I'm going to talk about and what you might have to say about it and how I might feel after. And I don't think most things are that surprising. And I could see if I had like a very deep seated, you know, issue that I had been battling with for many many years, but maybe there would be some element of like knowing what was the thing to talk about, but that's not really the case. So I just talk about whatever I talk about and don't necessarily expect there to be parallels and sometimes there are and that's sort of...sometimes that's kind of like a treat. But at the same time, if it really sticks with me and changes the way that I'm viewing things; yeah, it has the potential to like influence everything. So that's...and it has. In some...sometimes it has, so that's kind of different from the other activities. Plus if there's like this whole structure, like meditation is something that I have to be pretty self driven about. And in some sense, I've made a commitment to another person in therapy. [Pause]. So it has a bigger presence. [Pause]. </p> Yeah, that's pretty reflective of my value of people. I mean for some other people like meditation could be much...a much more dominant activity because it's driven entirely by the self and it's a solitary thing. Solitary activities that never had that much weight for me as not solitary activities I guess. Probably the yoga. [Pause]. </p> Um...[Pause].</p> I'm trying to imagine like a different person and personality type and if it would be any different. [Pause]. I think if I had a really talkative woman who was more ...[pause]. I don't know if this exists though. Maybe...I think in some sense if I felt like I was...I don't think the woman part is that important, but it's like the type of person I'm imagining, I don't know that many men...[pause]. Yeah, maybe like more...of a...I'm your pal dynamic would be less...I don't feel hurt. I don't think hurtful is the right word, but maybe less...[pause]...maybe like more; there would be more lubrication for the...like if you imagine that you're sort of like going on this road and like here are a bunch of bumps and turns and you don't really know where it's going to be maybe more like cushioning, if there is a...[pause]. </p> I can't really explain it. I guess I'm imagining like a...sort of more talkative...</p> Casual; lots of [inaudible 43:35]. But I don't think I want that. I think I want to come to a pretty objective place. So I'm not wishing that I had a more, you know.</p> Yes.</p> Maybe women.</p> But yeah, sure. That's true. I don't I want that though. I think I would grow more tired of the person if they were that way. If there is more of their personality and their thoughts. Because like, you know, unless they were like completely compatible, it seems like the nature of this stuff isn't so much about like what you say or how you say it, at least, but maybe it is. [Pause].</p> Maybe there would just be more hand holding. [Pause]. And reassurance that...[pause]...things were going to be okay. [Pause]. I'm not sure that anybody has that power to really reassure me that things are going to be okay other than myself. So...</p> Yeah. [Pause].</p> And we both laughed a lot about that because it was sort of this really sudden shift...[pause]...that neither of us could have anticipated. But that's sort of like the sentiment that I sometimes go back to. </p> Yeah, that would be helpful.</p> Mondays at 9:15; is that still open? </p> Well I don't really feel that strongly about getting in to lab early on Mondays because I'm not doing it anyway. </p> I feel pretty secure in my [inaudible 49:55] lab, so you can...</p> At least right now, that's not important.</p> Thanks.</p>",1
1004513666.txt,"So I have to leave like a little late and I have to leave about five minutes early just to get to work on time. I'm just going to set timer.</p> No because we didn't watch that other film this week.</p> So they need me there at eight. I just told them I would be five minutes late, so. (inaudible00:02:53) there. So if I leave at five of I'll be good. (Pause) So Georgia went well. Mostly well. As well as I kind of hoped it would go. So that was total relief. I (pause) um, my dad was the absolute best I've ever seen him. (pause) I know that he's on some (pause) anti-depressants. He's um, mostly for his bipolar and so (pause) it's working I guess. So I mean it was, it was ... it was like I'd never met him before. (chuckle) (pause) I mean not that extreme but like it was him (pause) just like totally (inaudible00:04:02) like totally (pause) you know he was really like he'd show up early in the afternoon. Which normally like he would show up usually like come around for dinner. I went and hung around with my brother in the afternoon he'd hang out at the beach with us and he you know he's really engaging like asking questions about our life which is like, I mean huge.</p> He would have I mean sort of interest or he was like throwing the football with Chris and was just totally just not ... my grandmother would try to like bait him. She's a little bit evil. And she would say things to him and he would just (pause) like sit there and kind of let it roll off and then you know kind of like you know give each other a look like, ""Oh."" And just have our own kind of moment about it and it would be done. And one night we went to dinner, just him and Chris and me and my grandmother and she was like (laugh) kind of dragging her feet, she didn't want to (inaudible00:05:00). And he was the one like, ""All right mom come on. Like these guys want to go do their own thing. It was like un ... unreal. It was unbelievable. (pause) And it was just a huge relief. Like I just felt so ... I mean I'm still nervous about spending more time with him in Massachusetts because I don't trust that these things will last for a longtime. But it was a relief to see that for now he's doing well and that um, maybe (pause) that I can ... that I can be around him and I can feel okay and that ... like I was really confident around the whole family the whole time which was really unusual for me I think in part because my dad was so even keeled and predictable. That it made me feel safe enough to feel confident and be okay and just ... like let some of the things my grandmother said kind of slide.</p> And um, you know I don't expect that maybe will always be the case but it was good for this trip because ... like if anything this weekend was just nice to have with my dad because I have never had anything like that before.</p> And so, (pause) every, every experience I had had with him in Georgia had been awful. And this was not even close. So (pause) it was good. It was nice. (pause) I mean every experience I've had in my life with him has really been (pause) very touch and good but this was the first one that I just felt like ... I left and I felt like I can even point to a thing with him that would have ... it was just amazing. (pause) So you know? I'm really happy about that. I'm trying to just (pause) I'm feeling that also that I'm not putting too much weight into it. I'm not, you know ... I know that ... I'm not trying to be pessimistic but I'm also not really like crazy optimistic where I think like, ""This is dad now."" (pause) I'm just trying to be realistic in the fact that like that experience was great and (pause) um, if we ever want that in the future I'm thrilled. And if things you know take a turn (pause) that's like I'm just really happy that that happened.</p> I really feel like (pause) um (pause) no matter what happens I will always have had that weekend with him. And so I'm really happy with that. (pause) I just feel really good. (pause) I don't know what he's on but it's great. (pause) My grandmother on the hand is a little less great. (pause) She's like she ... I don't know she's so weird. I mean like (pause) you know so whenever my brothers come to Georgia they get a limo (pause) at like she comes in the limo ... it's an hour and fifteen from her apartment to the airport. So she gets this big limo for them and she comes in the limo. She has champagne and the whole thing and granted our flight got in at um, midnight on Thursday but ... so she sends a town car and um, it's an hour and half to the airport and so we take the town car an hour and a half back and the driver's like, ""All right so it's going to be ninety bucks."" And I was just kind of like, ""Oh all right you know like it's fine we'll put it on the credit card."" But immediately I was like ... like my brothers every time they come get like the royal treatment, like everything rolled out. And it's not a big deal because we're adults. So we can pay for our own car. (pause) But I mean immediately like that gets in my head like, ""How did you ever know what my brothers get when they come down here?"" And so ... I don't know, so whatever (pause) you know Chris's (inaudible00:09:50) like it's fine. That's why we have a credit card like we'll live.</p> And (pause) so uh (pause) anyway you know we all have a nice time and we're ... my aunt and uncle are down there; my dad's brother, his wife and their three kids who are kind of younger. They're you know in middle school and elementary school. And you know she came down and spent the whole first day at the beach with us. A family that I grew up babysitting for; who I was really close too. It's (pause) my grandmother's friends son who's in his forties now but when I was growing they were in their like twenties or thirties and they lived next door to us. And I would spend a lot of time ... I mean I would go on vacation with. I used there house kind of like ... I would spend the night there probably at least twice a week and just spend a lot of time with them.</p> Yeah because they ... like it doesn't bother them ... they just don't ... they don't just like ... they just roll their eyes. And that's what I was kind of doing this time. But I'm just ... I'm really sensitive. (Laugh)</p> Yeah there are certain things that I get a harder time for ... (pause) and just um ... and you know and like Chris was saying ... I was saying to him like, ""How are my little cousins around all of this?"" Like I have girl cousins who are twelve and Fifteen who were down this time and I have two other girl cousins who are twenty-one and eighteen. And their family doesn't come down for it anymore because of an incident that happened with my girl cousin who is twenty-one. When she was like fifteen um ...</p> My grandmother ... my aunt; my dad's sister walked into my grandmother's bedroom and my grandmother had my cousin's arm twisted behind her back and was ... I don't know what she was doing. But they got into some argument and my grandmother got upset with her and twisted her arm behind her back and my brother Alex, the one who's nineteen was down with them and my aunt just said, ""Everybody pack your stuff, we're going. We're leaving right. We're not coming ... we're just ... I'm not coming back down here again."" And so they all packed up and left.</p> Yeah. Yeah the youngest. (pause) And they ... I mean they're just the sweetest kids and (pause) you know my aunt is a really good mom. She's really tied up with them. Of course my grandmother gives her a hard time for that. Like (pause) they got, you know my uncle and my grandmother who never ... have never gotten into a big argument; they got into I guess a huge argument a couple months ago and my dad was around. That my aunt is too (pause) is too attentive to them, to the kids. That my twelve-year-old cousin should be more independent and should be doing stuff on her own. And it's like whether that's true or not, I mean it doesn't (pause) I don't think it like (pause) should ever escalate to an argument of like a screaming match, like you know. And I just don't think that that's really my grandmother's business. Whether my aunt is too attentive to her kids. And whether my twelve-year-old cousin is independent enough or not ... my aunt Judy was talking to me about it and that particular child's personality is just one who likes to be around adults more and she just ... she has a little harder time socially and so her mom has, you know treats her a little bit differently because of her personality. And it's like you know that's how they're going to do it in their family, you know.</p> Yes. She's the school psychologist at their school as well and so I think she is around a lot and I think she does (pause) but she's not this like crazy (inaudible00:22:30) like I see her around her kids and she's like (pause) you know (pause) when I see here around them I think like, ""That seems completely perfect to me."" Like you know they get themselves ready to go to the beach. They get their own sunscreen on. They make sure they have all there things they need. You know like it's not like she's in there like combing their hair ... you know like they seem to be doing everything appropriately for their age.</p> Yeah.</p> Well I was trying to look for the validity in it and I just can't ...</p> I don't know.</p> She's crazy. (Chuckle)</p> She has this authoritative role in our family I guess. And I guess you know because of that everybody does take a little bit of what she says seriously because she ... I mean like (pause) everybody's kind of like (pause) I don't know I mean (pause) she just gets so clear that she's in charge, do you know what I mean?</p> I don't know. I mean well holds the purse strings. (pause) And so everybody kind of bows down to her for that reason. But you know when somebody has this loud booming voice that's just seems kind of like (pause) I know that what she's saying has no ... like she would tell stories that happened from when we were kids and it was like, ""That's just wrong."" I mean that's wrong. That's just not factual at all. And so I know that she's crazy. I know that what she's saying is crazy. But ... I don't know it's just, you know, it's just kind of how it's been and it's just been a more recent thing that she's gotten this crazy .... Like she's always been in that role before but the things that she said before held a little bit more truth or like started with a seed of truth and then (pause) kind of went from there. But now it just seems like it's all kind of (pause) just full on crazy.</p> Yeah. Definitely. I think the whole family sees her as powerful.</p> Yeah.</p> I know. But what I'm saying is that it's hard to be ... I've always felt like the one on the outside being like (pause) just doing things or saying things a little different and so when I'm like back around everybody it's hard (pause) cause you want to (pause) you know you want to (pause) kind of assimilate to everybody but without ... but then in your own way kind of. Like so every time she's like ... you know like make ... I don't know ... I don't know. Make either like (pause) like a ... says like she didn't mean it like that like try to stickup for my cousins or like say like stickup for my aunt or somebody. And like (inaudible00:26:02) like I don't agree with what she's saying or what she's doing but at the same time like I don't want to be the one fighting with her either. And so you just kind of like let some of it ... I don't know. I guess ... yeah she has this crazy power in my head. She used to watch us a lot as kids. And yeah she was in charge and so when you ... you know I grew up with her just being in charge.</p> I don't know. Like since we were down there I hear myself sounding like her. And whether it's true or not I just hear it. Like words or phrases come out of my mouth and I'm like, ""Oh my God that's her."" And as soon as I hear it I just like (pause) like watches me to stop speaking.</p> Like being argumentative. Everything (chuckle) Nana would say, she would just ... not anything but ... one her things she would just do is just go, ""No. No that's not true. That's not true."" It's just what she ... that would just be a response of hers. She'll do a lot of things. (laugh) And I do that like I hear myself doing that with my friends in conversation or with Chris you know it's like now. That's definitely not true. It's like that's terrible. That's terrible. Because ...</p> I don't know. Like I just ... I hate that immediate reaction of like, ""I'm right. I have authority on this and I've heard two sentences of what you've said and I've disqualified it."" And whether or not I'm actually doing that, I don't know because (pause) I don't know. (pause) But I do feel like, I like mimic ... I've mimicked some of her authority. Like I've mimicked that kind of behavior and that like ... that's like this toughness is like you know (pause) and I feel like I've mimicked some of it and I don't like that. (Chuckle)</p> Yeah. Right. And it comes from just (pause) you know I know that it comes from a lack of self-esteem, a lack of just thinking that people will take me seriously because of what have (pause) to offer or say matters or that they ... you know or because people I'm talking to usually care about me, like me, or love me. And so ... but I just instead take on this like, you know kind of tough attitude and it's not very cute.</p> It's not cute. I'm not charming. It's not like ... like I always kind of play it off in my head. It's like, just kind of like it's like a show. It's just like a cute thing I do. It's like not really cute but like you know kind of like a showy thing. But it's like I'm sure she probably thinks that too. She really doesn't have any awareness of how harsh that comes off and how harsh that sounds. And um (pause) and how it just like makes other ... it just immediately makes the person that she's talking to feel like (pause) okay, like sometimes you're acting, ""Okay. Like I'm sorry. What ... all right. Tell me what you have to say because everything you have to say apparently is right and that nothing any of us say is valid."" And I just know that I have done that in certain circumstance with my friends or my family and it I just don't want to write people off like that because it's not (pause) I don't know it's just not ... healthy way to have any relationship. (pause)</p> Mm-hm. Well I feel like I'm afraid of taking on their strongest (pause) like character flaws. Yeah so my dad's like dependency issues or my dad's mental health issues or you know I guess my grandmother's mental health issues. (pause) Just these (pause) huge things (pause) and I just don't want to be like that. So I feel like I'm always waiting to prove myself ... prove to myself that I like ... I'm just always seeing things that are like them instead of seeing things that aren't like them. I'm always seeing like, ""Why'd you do that? Oh my God you do that?"" (pause)</p> Yeah I guess, I don't know.</p> I don't know. I just don't know like ... I was thinking like I'm waiting to prove myself wrong that I'm not like them.</p> But I don't know. (pause) I think if I can be um (pause) you know like not living there is one of the things that made not like them. Moving across country by myself was something that made me not like them and you know living, you know living in different places and meeting different people and meeting people that aren't like me made me think ... you know not like them. And so (pause) now I'm moving back. (laugh) And I was just thinking that, you know like I have this idea for a small business that I'm thinking about for when I move to Massachusetts and it's just something I've been thinking about and writing a lot of ideas about and (pause) And my uncle and I were at dinner asked, ""Well what are you going to do when you ...</p> Bless you. Moved to Massachusetts and ...</p> Bless you.</p> (Chuckle) I said I was ... I had a few glasses of wine at this point because normally I keep these kinds of things kind of close because I don't like ... I always feel like they're going to judge me and then they get really easily in my head about it. I said, ""Well I was thinking about taking some business and entrepreneurship classes because I have this idea (pause) and I kind of explained to him. It's like a baby concierge ... I don't know if you've ever heard of them. They're cropping up in mostly New York City and here but (pause) I explained the whole idea to them and they just look at ... like they gave absolutely no reaction at all. Just kind of looked at me after me talking about it for five minutes and just said nothing. Absolutely nothing. And then change the subject to something with Chris. And I was like (pause), ""Okay."" (Laugh) So you guys think that's a terrible idea? But instead of just saying they don't say anything. And um ... but I feel like if I could do something like that it would make me different me, it would make me (pause) I don't know not only is it something that I'm really excited about and I think, I think is a good idea, but ... (pause) I just feel like it would be something that I could be like proud of and be different from (pause) from them and too that I can just something on my own. I want to do something on my own without their help or without Chris's help or without just on my own.</p> But for them to have the reaction of just staring at me made me feel like, ""Oh, okay."" Kind of left me (inaudible00:35:39) it. I'm like a little bit ... and keep it at the same time a little bit like, ""No I'm definitely going to do it. I'm definitely going to do that."" And I'm going to take classes when we move to Massachusetts and I want be really, you know I want to do as best that I can and really try because of that. Well ... (pause)</p> So I don't know it made me kind of feel like (inaudible00:36:07). Yeah so I guess that was one of the things that me feel like I could proof to myself that I'm nothing like them. Because none of them ... that's not the driving force behind it, obviously. And that's not ... I wasn't even thinking ... that wasn't even at the forefront of my thinking when I started thinking about, but it was what I was just thinking when you ask me what I was thinking there.</p> Yeah. (sigh)</p> Yeah it does when I think about it and when I think about just ... just the fact that I'm not ... my grandmother's money is very appealing to me. I think it ... but I'm not afraid at the end of the day either to just say like, ""I don't need this. Like I don't need you giving me a hard time. Like I would gladly just not come around anymore and not take any money from you ever again if I have to keep putting up with this."" Because it ... I mean I'm going to have to keep putting up with it but like if it gets to a point where it's just like ... like I'm just not going to be around her. This in my mind was like a strike one kind of thing because I just can't ... I mean I know she's not going to change. I know I'm setting myself up to just ... but (pause) like she doesn't do that to my brothers at all, at all. And they don't get it when I say to them; because they both called yesterday to see how it was and they were both really, you know happy about my dad and everything and I talked about my grandmother and neither of them got it.</p> It's ... I mean and my brothers have always been like (pause) (sigh) All hail. And you know I get that my brothers are cute and charming and like sweet and lovely boys but uh ... (pause) but we're all flawed (laugh) individuals like I'm not any (pause) I wasn't not a cute, charming, sweet kid. Like I was a kid and there was nothing about me that deserved any sort of that. I didn't deserve a target on my back that said, ""Pick on me because you don't like my personality."" You know or ...</p> And so I just, you know it frustrates the life out of me that I'm still, you know with her and my dad and my dad I'm kind of getting what I was looking for and what I was hoping for all this time with him. (pause) And was looking for just a peaceful, calm ... I was looking for him to be interested in me. And for him to you know show any interest. And I got it even if it was just for a weekend. That will do. Like I'll take it. But I'm still waiting with her.</p> Yeah exactly. (pause) But you know if there's more that's great. If that's it that's fine. (sniffle) (pause) With her it's a question mark. And I ... you know she's only in Massachusetts for a few months a year. (chuckle) It's good and it's not like I have to live with her.</p> It's five of.</p> Okay. Yeah I do have to drive.</p> But I'll see you on Friday at 7:45.</p> Oh is that not a good trashcan?</p> Okay.</p> March. Or February.</p> Okay, great.</p> Thank you so much.</p> Bye.</p>",2
1004798809.txt,"Hi.</p> Yeah I can't think very well (inaudible at 00:00:15).</p> That would be fine. I was actually going to suggest that (inaudible at 00:00:35)</p> Yeah. Yeah, like I said, I, I'm not, I'm just not thinking well today.</p> So... Like, I'm awake, which is good. I made it here sort of on time which is good. (PAUSE) [00:00:57]</p> Well thinking I just don't know if I can string a sentence together today at all. And, you know, you've got other stuff happening and so I'm just like, ""Well would it make more sense to just say skip it?"" [00:02:05]</p> ...panicking. (LAUGHTER)</p> Yes. Yes. Yes. But I don't know (inaudible at 00:03:07) But at the same time, I've literally taken one dose so part of me... I mean, I kind of want to say, ""Well, see what it does in a couple, three days."" Like, you know, in a couple of days. Yeah. (PAUSE) But the, you know, the alarm or the panic comes like the impulse to hurt myself and like that's no good. (PAUSE) I don't know. I just don't feel like I'm good for anything when I'm like this. I just (inaudible at 00:03:57). Both not being good for anything and thinking that I'm not good for anything. (LAUGHTER) I can't think very clearly. [00:04:05]</p> Yes. Yeah... (PAUSE) It at least comes from the same place. (PAUSE) Well it's still the same thing. You know. I think.</p> Um...</p> (LAUGHTER) [00:04:57]</p> Yeah, you say that and I try to believe you.</p> I feel kind of like a vegetable right now. It's like, ""Well I can't, I can't figure things out as a vegetable."" (LAUGHTER) Yes?</p> It just keeps coming back to that. How do I figure it out.</p> Yeah, yeah. I really don't want it to be but it is. (PAUSE) But it's not... I guess what I'm afraid of isn't that I will say something that I don't want to share with you or that I don't want to come out. [00:07:00]</p> Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah. Also this is hard work and I don't want to work very hard right now. I'm already working really hard to kind of keep my eyes focused and opened. (LAUGHTER)</p> I could. (PAUSE) That seems really hard.</p> That (PAUSE) that, just that... It's harder to let go of the impulse to keep myself together than it is to keep myself together. [00:09:01]</p> And I sense for you to even suggest that and for me to then do it, that would be like, that's another example of me telling myself to be a certain way and then trying to live that out as opposed to just...</p> Yeah. (PAUSE) Yeah.</p> I hate to... (PAUSE) I really don't want to be where I am. (PAUSE) [00:11:00]</p> And... (PAUSE) the other thing I think is that like, you know, there are a certain number of kind of obvious conclusions that I have come to and kind of been like, ""Well. I guess I got that figured out."" I've been like, ""There's a shock."" I don't like feeling helpless because when I was a kid, I couldn't guarantee that somebody would make food for me if I couldn't make it myself. Wonder where that comes from? (LAUGHTER) And so I'm... (PAUSE) [00:14:51]</p> They do feel trite, yeah.</p> I don't see the use other than saying, ""Okay well I know this. I'll watch out for it.""</p> That seems useful. (LAUGHTER) [00:19:01]</p> I mean knowing that seems useful.</p> (inaudible at 00:19:35)</p> Okay.</p> Hmm.</p> Yeah.</p> I didn't tell anybody that story for like ten years.</p> Like I didn't talk about it until like, I until after I had gotten to the point where I, I said, ""Okay. I'm not that person anymore.""</p> (LAUGHTER) [00:21:59]</p> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p> Yeah. And another thing I really remember about talking, talking with that with her was a kind of early days when she said, ""What do you want?"" And I said, ""I want to be with my mother."" And that just didn't. I mean, it couldn't have happened because like my mom wasn't in a position for us to be with her. But... (PAUSE) [00:24:00]</p> You just said, ""Oh?""</p> (LAUGHTER) Really?</p> Oh really?</p> Wow. (PAUSE) That was like ground I walked on for years.</p> I guess I just took it as a given.</p> Oh. (PAUSE) [00:26:00]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah. You know, because I was and I was living with my dad and things weren't very good and everything kind of shifted around when I was, over time when I was in high school. [00:27:01]</p> But she just loved that. Like that was what she wanted. She didn't want to be my mother. She wanted to be my sibling. And like, ""Well, I have a sister. (PAUSE) I don't have a mother. I can't help you there."" (PAUSE) [00:28:00]</p> Yeah. (LAUGHTER)</p> (LAUGHTER)</p> Yeah.</p> Yes. Yes.</p> Yeah.</p> I was also, I mean, I was terrified that she would kill herself when I was little. Like when I was... You know, I think she told us when I was like nine or ten that she had tried to kill herself like the night that she left my dad. So like I knew that was a possibility. You know, I, I, I thought I had to take... [00:29:01]</p> Yeah. (LAUGHTER) Yeah. Sorry, somehow I thought I just told you these things already. (LAUGHTER)</p> Yeah.</p> I think you're just on the unfortunate, in the unfortunate position of catching me as like the fifteenth therapist...</p> ...to whom I've had to tell my life story. (LAUGHTER)</p> There gets to be a, a kind of condensed narrative that I just say, ""This is what I have because..."" You know...</p> ...practice your lines enough times...</p> ... they pretty much just come out pat.</p> (LAUGHTER)</p> No, no, no. (inaudible)</p> No.</p> Yeah. And yeah. And it's one of those things that... Like at this point...</p> ...even though I haven't talked about it, I've kind of just assumed that you knew.</p> Yeah. So, there was that. (inaudible)</p> Yes. As best I remember, she was telling us about like, like the night that resulted in her leaving my dad. Like all I remember is, is like waking up one morning and coming down into the kitchen and there were these ladies from church that I didn't know very well in the kitchen and my mother was gone. And eventually, like, I was told that she was in the hospital. And like I don't remember when I saw her next but it wasn't for a while, I think. You know, I imagined it was when, after she got out of the hospital. Maybe I visited. I only visited her in the hospital like once or twice. [00:32:00]</p> She had been.</p> She was hospitalized, she had been hospitalized at least a couple of times before them. But I was too young to kind of realize what that meant. So like one of my very earliest memories was being at the beach and my mom, with my dad and my mom was in the hospital. I just knew mom was in the hospital and that's all like it didn't mean anything. (PAUSE) But (PAUSE) you know, we visited her, she had us every other weekend and that's not very much. So... (PAUSE) [00:33:00]</p> I would, she would just drop off the map for long periods of time or what felt like long periods of time. There was one time that I was at camp and she was really good about like, she would always send me a care package when I was camp which was really nice. And there was one year that I just didn't hear from her at all. And I like wrote to my dad and was like, ""Where is mom?"" and he didn't answer. And finally I like flipped out, you know, hysterical, crying, like... (LAUGHTER) In retrospect, these, you know, 20 year old counselors were like, ""What the fuck do we do with this fifth grader...</p> ""...who's losing it?"" And I found out that like she was in the hospital but she had told my dad that he couldn't tell me that she was in the hospital. She never wanted anybody to know that she was sick. So she would just, so she would just be gone and I didn't know why. And... (PAUSE) You know, so it was like I never knew. Like I still feel like I have to be very careful what I say to her because if I say the wrong thing, she'll kill herself. (PAUSE) I was going to make that, say that less. I don't necessarily think she'll actually kill herself but yeah I think I need to change that. But yeah, I, yeah, I, I missed her and I felt like it was my responsibility to take care of her. Yeah. And then she started smoking and I liked freaked out. She started smoking when I was like eight. Like, right after she got divorced. [00:35:19]</p> And I was really upset because like, that's the one thing that they tell kids is like smoking will kill you. (LAUGHTER) And I couldn't make her stop doing it and like I hated that. You know? (PAUSE)</p> Yeah I thought it would kill her. Yeah. (PAUSE) [00:36:00]</p> Yeah.</p> Okay thanks.</p>",1
1004565041.txt,"I guess where we left off the last time. I'm not sure where it exactly was.</p> Well it's not that it didn't sit right. It's just that I wondered if that was indeed the case. Could be, I don't know, if that's...</p> Could you explain that?</p> Okay.</p> I still I guess don't think it does because if this is something that's been playing out in the other world, the day-to-day world for me, I don't see my direction or my objectification of people I don't even know or people I do kind of as being a power thing. So I understand that the dynamic here is different; you do have power and I'm entirely okay with that. But I don't think I'm trying to equalize it or shift it. I think it's just a, it's part of what I do generally.</p> It means that I did it earlier today. It means I do it here, it means I will probably do it later today. And although I did it earlier today, I stopped to ask myself so you're done with school; what is the pressure? What is the need for this? And I don't know. I couldn't answer it. I was a little dismayed but it also just seems like a force of habit. So I don't know how to explain it now.</p> But I've thought about this for the past couple of weeks. And this objectification to me seems like just - to give another poor fitting analogy is to say it's a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there in that it's not as though I am thinking that any of these fantasies or whatever are something that I look to as a replacement for my current situation, my current status. So it's - I think it's the knowledge that it is impermanent, temporary, fleeting that carries the appeal.</p> Yes, but also it's - yes, I mean in such a way that it does not matter what they're like to be around. That's kind of beside the point. When I say they I mean...</p> Yes, and when I think about these as they happen or just after, when I say they happen it's like five seconds sometimes. I don't know. I guess I - a number of things happened but one of them is I think to myself well, I think to myself before to what end? What do I really think this is going to happen? Why do I put myself in a position that I know isn't going to lead to anything?</p> Yes, yes and it's become a habit. I don't know. I just don't know.</p> I don't know. It's - I guess to clarify it there seems to have become I don't know if it's, if I should say an alternative to what I've been doing or another version of it. But it seems like I can look at somebody and find them attractive and although I enjoy the finding them attractive I don't necessarily go into a fantasy. [00:10:45]</p> It feels a little uncomfortable.</p> I don't know. I guess - I don't know, I just, I can't - maybe it's because it's so close to my other process that I can't until now, how to differentiate the two, or at least acknowledge that there are at least two versions of this. I don't know but it's - I guess in some ways it comes back to me wondering how would I react if in the process of finding somebody attractive I was put in a situation where I had to... [00:12:28]</p> Yes. Not should, want, yes. I don't know. So that to me seems like what happened this morning at least.</p> Yes. You mean do I act on it as far as enter it into a fantasy?</p> Yes, true.</p> I guess I see them all as the same. And - or at least I have until recently.</p> Well I think at one time they were all, when I wasn't married for example - I should say I wasn't (inaudible) in any way with my wife then, partnered, whatever - I think the point was to find somebody attractive, flirt to the point where something does happen.</p> All part of the process, yes, yes. And again even then I don't think it mattered, or I should say there were times when it didn't matter. The appeal was that it was fleeting, that it was - you didn't have to deal with whatever, life. And that hasn't changed. But I think it's just a matter of being able to realize that there are different degrees of subsiding.</p> Well I think beyond the fact that I was and still am in love with her, I think for a long time it was I wanted stability and I wanted intimacy and as much of a family as a husband and wife are. And I don't know what else to say. [00:18:58]</p> Yes, so what do you make of that?</p> So what do people do? I mean do they just understand that these things serve a purpose and they go no further than what is, what fulfills the purpose?</p> Yes, it's exhausting.</p> I guess I still wonder even if I do understand that there is a point at which it serves a purpose and beyond that it's excessive or whatever, what is it about not being able to trust myself that is still there?</p> So how would I do that? [00:24:30]</p> Well I suppose even acknowledging that there's a difference between seeking someone's attention and then just finding somebody attractive is in a way trusting myself. But when I go to a coffee shop and I see the person behind the counter as attractive, will I go back to that coffee shop? Probably.</p> To see the person behind the counter. And that, to me, when it involves volition, I think then...</p> Yes.</p> Yes.</p> Yes, or even being entirely happy to pay you every week to see you. Not so happy but, you know, acceptable. I guess that's when I start to wonder if it's...</p> Yes. And why I need that motivation or just have it? But I do know that it's not just a matter of seeing you that I've been coming here. I do realize that coming here and actually dealing with the very issue that I'm struggling with with you is - I mean I'm hopeful in that, I'm confident in that I am making progress. But when you ask what would it look like if I did trust myself. I mean I think it's easier to trust myself since I don't drink. But even still I've found myself in situations where I think it just felt wrong. I didn't go too far necessarily but it's - I could have.</p> Maybe I used to look forward to that in fact...</p> ...because it allowed for lax behavior.</p> That wouldn't be the same. And what I mean by that is that I couldn't work through this with...</p> Yes. True, but...</p> I think you mentioned earlier just the kind of adrenaline burst or just excitement or difference or response maybe I guess. I don't know. Perhaps trust.</p> No, just - I meant just her. It's, and she doesn't say it, she never brings it up, but even when the subject of Canada comes up, I just shudder. She doesn't. A couple days ago when I was finished she said what you need is a week in [inaudible], which is a region in Canada where that whole thing happened. And it's like, she was saying it lovingly and like I deserve it, but for me it was like a knife through my heart.</p> I said yes, yes, that's right. I just changed the subject. It wasn't like...</p> I'm afraid to because I don't want to, I don't want to bum her out either. I mean I think I've told her that for me, we've got friends from Canada recently, we just went down there to see them, and she's talking about having a house down there. And for me I think I told her that look Canada is not something I feel - I mean it's tainted for me. The whole country, the whole - I just can't, at least right now look at it as being a really appealing place to be at all. The reason people go there in large part is because of the beaches. And for me to find myself on the west coast of Canada would just be - it's just something I can't bear. Especially having gone to those places with her after it happened, when she knows and she was upset with me and I was feeling like crap. And that being the memory that I have of those places and the memory I've had of being in Canada for three months after that where I just felt like shit and I - so yes. And yet somehow I will forget those things when I'm out in the street. So kind of how do I do that? How do I forget how awful I felt for so long to even today and yet I'm still able to just... [00:36:35]</p> I guess it would be unreasonable to expect that I would deny myself of the rush of what those fleeting [inaudible at 00:38:22].</p> Yes, I see what you're saying.</p> Yes. You know, the idea of getting help as a couple in order to even to check in to see where she is, that scares the hell out of me. It's like I know I'm going to feel like hell. I know we're leaving the country in August. I don't know how or when we're going to move through it.</p> Yes.</p> Yes.</p> True, true. But it's the very thing that I'm so angry with my dad about. That he didn't get help for me - and I was one of the ones who was affected by his failures. [00:42:26]</p> Yes, I know. Exactly. I know how damaging it could be no matter how okay she seems.</p> I know. In our remaining time can we talk about something more uplifting?</p> I don't know what that might be.</p> Oh, is that what that's for? [00:44:06]</p> It's so tiny.</p> I know that drawer might be more.</p> Yes, yes. Just never open it.</p> So next week I graduate and the family's coming to town Tuesday and Wednesday until Saturday and Sunday. Yes, so it still hasn't quite hit me yet.</p> Yes.</p> I don't know. I guess it just seemed easier than I thought it would be.</p> No.</p> Yes.</p> Yes, and, although this might be digressing into not uplifting, because it's over and because it went by so fast and because it didn't seem like it was that challenging, it just makes me question whether or not I really needed to do it at all. And yet I don't think I would've been able to reach that conclusion without having done it. At the same time, it's now leading me out of the country to do work that I probably couldn't do without it. So I guess questioning the motive for doing it and the logic of doing it is kind of beside the point. [00:47:11]</p> Yes, okay. If I don't tell you this before I leave - you're really wise.</p> So are we over at [inaudible at 00:49:11] today?</p> I see you're wearing the school colors.</p> That's right, that's right. Just seems so appropriate for some reason, but yes.</p> You don't get to wear jeans over there?</p> I see. Yes, I think Dr. [inaudible] wears cords a lot of the time.</p> I see.</p> I don't think it's going to be next week.</p>",0

And (pause) I worked last week one day and then this week I had off because I had you know, school. And then I went to school yesterday morning, I worked after school from like three o'clock until they close at nine. And (pause) you know, I gave my schedule to my cousin to see when I can work and when I'm available. And she texted me you know, Sunday, said, ""When you say yes on a day does that mean, you know that you can work?"" I said yeah, it means I'm around all day. [00:01:28]</p> Yeah, very, very much so.</p> And you know, it just, it, it ended. You know, it irritates me when my cousin's like, ""Well I've got you on for thirty six hours"". And I did it out and it's thirty two. So she kind of you know (chuckle), it kind of you know, it pissed her off a little. You know, it pissed me off, it was just like, ""Well I scheduled you in"". I'm like, I don't want this. [00:07:20]</p> Family. How I did, you know growing up; I did have a very close relationship with my cousin, my aunt, my uncle. You know, I used to; I was very close to them. I used to stay at their house all the time. I used to do a lot of things; I used to always want to be with them. But, me working on me, you know, being in business with them and seeing this other side of them pushes me away from them. I don't want to associate with them. [00:13:43]</p> It's starting to. It's starting to. The problem is, they have a lot of volume, they do make a lot of cash. So, I think the greed is kicking in to them, but, the amount of work that they can do as they're getting older; my aunt and uncle are in their seventies, my cousin's pushing forty. They're physically breaking down. Um, reputation around town is out that they're not fun people to work for, so applications coming in are down. The amount of people that work for them are down, and all their old staff is getting older and breaking down physically. So, in reality I see the business has hit its peak and now I see it coming down. And I've, I wanted to be there to right the ship to keep it up, but I finally realized you know, a year and a half ago that anything I say they're not going to listen to; they're not going to value my opinion, they're not going to you know, listen to me, they think I'm out to get them. [00:16:00]</p> Because they thought I was there to sabotage.</p> No, they weren't suspicious, they just, they were the type of people that don't like to find new help. They were the type of people that the less people they have on the more money they make.</p> Because they wanted me to get rid of people that I didn't like, they thought if I had a problem with somebody. Because I never really clashed with the thieves because they knew I knew. And they, you know the thieves they didn't know to them, that I was just saying stuff to get them in trouble, but really I had full evidence. I saw, I witnessed people do it. You know, it was, one of them, I told my cousin about it, she goes, ""No they wouldn't do it"". Then my cousin finally saw her red handedly doing it. Then she was like, she wouldn't have never looked, you know, but because I put that thought in her head to like look suspicious at it and she finally did it once, it was like, ""Jesus Christ you're right"". You know, but at first they don't believe me; they never believe me. [00:19:06]</p> Because of the drug incident.</p> Because of me selling drugs and you know, doing drugs while I was working there.</p> Probably, I'm uh, I, I, I'm guessing, I can't say that is, because that is in the past. You know I have been you know, cocaine and prescription drug clean for you know for over six years. I haven't been mariPetera clean you know though, but I haven't smoked mariPetera since January. You know, I mean I, I try to cut down on my alcohol intake. I don't drink you know, heavy all the time anymore. I mean a lot of it was me just being a wild early twenty year old who thought he was invincible. [00:22:19]</p> Because I've never seen them react so emotionally you know, to defend me before. And I don't know you know, if it's going to come out. You know, and then I don't want to be in the middle of a family fight. I don't want to start a family fight. But, I just know that my mom is not going to hold her tongue back with her sister, she's not. [00:24:17]</p> She'll, she'll ask her what was going on, if she knew why they were treating me like this. Why? She'll, she'll try to ask the questions why I was only working four hours. Why, why doesn't, you know and she'll start pushing buttons because my mother gets very emotional into things, she's very you know, quick to react; she's a very reactionary emotional decision maker. [00:24:46]</p> Nope, she'll just get worked up, worked up and just start going. And that's kind of what I'm afraid of. Is she's just gonna you know blow something up. But, (pause) you know, I mean it, and it, and it sucks because you know, me and my siblings asked her to do this, you know, seven years ago when we were all working there and she didn't. [00:25:18]</p> To step up to my aunt and my uncle and say something, and my cousin because we felt that if it came more from my parents that it would have more of an impact on them. And, and it took my mother twelve years of us being there, to finally not take her sisters side and finally take her children's side. And to me that's, it's new. So I don't know how she's gonna react. I don't know what's going to happen. (pause) I know something is going to happen, but I don't know what, and that's you know, I, it, as much as I talk about how much you know, like my parents don't do for me and don't do that. The more and more we're talking here and I think as old as they're getting, is they're starting to finally see our side, they're starting to finally stick up for us. [00:26:21]</p> Just to stop being picked on. Stop being walked all over. I kind of think we got that, you know that side from my dad growing up and that's our personality. Was, we do see people picking on us, we do see people taking advantage of us, we do see people using us but yet we still go back to those people. [00:27:16]</p> To what extent?</p> I think that's why I'm here, is I'm trying to break away from that. I mean I told you, you know in our first couple sessions how I have a control issue, uh, well I wouldn't say I have one anymore, I had one you know I mean I still have a control issue but I wanted to be involved in everything. Everything I was involved in, I wanted to have my two cents in, to do this, to run this, and you know, now you know working with you and working in here, is I'm kind of content with taking a back seat role. [00:31:16]</p> I don't know cuz I've never done it. I've never been, done anything like that before. Everything that I've done has been mostly family oriented. Yeah.</p> Yes. You know I can, I should be now. I think now, you know, moving out was kind of rough. You know, I, I did feel homesick and did all that stuff, but after being back, I don't want to be there anymore. I, I don't want to be there anymore, I can't do it. I, I, you know, it's to the point where I'm ready to be you know with my girlfriend. I'm ready to be with her. I'm ready to you know, start my own you know, life with her. [00:32:13]</p> We've been talking about it, we're planning on moving once I get a full time position. Depending on what school system I end up in, is then, when we'll start discussing a move. But yes, it has been talked about. [00:32:31]</p> Yes, for September.</p> There are opportunities, but a lot of them uh, most of them came out now, you know, but you know, I'm trying to wait for jobs that come out, cuz I broke them by list into districts, I want to work in a regional school district so I have like five or six districts. So if public, or schools or regional school zone, but that's where I'm headed. So I have a region, excuse me, I have a region that I'd like to be involved, be staying in. So, that's what works out, but I've also been you know doing that working you know, figuring out what's going on, but they just had a couple come out this time of year, but a lot of them won't come out until you know early August. [00:33:25]</p> The bar,</p> The bar, excuse me. I know it's gonna fail before it even starts and, and ultimately, that's what they want me to do, is to come back. But I don't want to. And this is, this has been the hardest for me because I've walked away before, but I've always came back. And to me, I'm kind of scared about going back. About being pulled back because it kind of reverts the me moving out. [00:34:52]</p> Emotions.</p> Guilt. Probably mostly guilt because knowing that you know, I told them I would help them and I ultimately couldn't. You know I do have a lot of guilt in me. You know I do feel bad because I do see my aunt working in pain, I do see my uncle working in pain, I do see my cousin working in pain (inhale) and I do want to help them out. I do want to you know, to, in my heart I do want to see them you know have a successful business. But in my head I want them to fail. I want them to, to know what it's like to be back down where they were. To remember what it was like. You know, to be the family that I used to love hanging out with as a kid. You know instead of these people that they are now. I don't like these people. [00:35:56]</p> Greed. Greedy, treat people like dirt, constantly on edge. You know, constantly picking on me for no reason. You know, picking on other employees for no reason. Yelling at customers. I don't like those people. I really don't. And it's just something that you know, I thought again, I could control the situation, change it. But, you know, I can't. I need to move on and I need to you know, get myself, you know in the right direction. And I feel the best thing to do is to just walk away from them. [00:36:40]</p> About me not being able to work anymore. (pause) Because, and this is my opinion to them, it's like, do you want to work or don't you want to work? I mean back when I was younger before I had the drug issues and stuff, they used to get mad at me if I took days off. Because I wanted, I was a kid, you know eighteen, nineteen, twenty years old, I wanted my Saturday-Sundays off. To them, they used to always say, ""Do you want to work or do you want to have fun?"" You know and I'd always go to work because I felt bad. I was always guilted into it. (sigh) [00:38:27]</p> It's, it's very disturbing, and it's very you know, it puts things into place, and I don't know why I keep it, but I do keep it. I have held it for over a year.</p> Just listen to the tone of his voice, listen to how he's speaking to me, how he's addressing me. This is after one of our big arguments.</p> I want you to know the working environment that I'm at, just how it's you know, the environment that I've been in. And this is, you'll get the relationship that we have. Because of this place. And maybe you can get a sense from his voice about how it really, how it you know, it the trust is still not there and it just.</p> He mentions Peter.</p> Oh I'm sorry, do you want me to play it again?</p> He was on a cell phone.</p> He mentioned Peter who is one of the other cooks. And Peter in my opinion is the dictator of that business. Peter is an illegal immigrant who just recently became a citizen because he married an American girl. And Peter gets to pick and choose what hours he works, gets to pick and choose what days he works. And whenever something goes wrong to mess up what Peter is doing, Peter's schedule, that's when they attack me. Because they have me work so Peter can have Friday nights off, Sunday nights off, Saturday nights off, so all my schedules for four days. You know, and then him mentioning talking to the boys, well his two brothers work there, and having me work these nights in these four hour shifts, is I come in at four and they all leave. You know what I mean, and that's what, that's what irritates me. Is, who are these people to tell you how to run your business? [00:43:26]</p> Mmhm. Mmhm. And what pisses me off is he goes, the first sentence he said was, ""I was talking to Peter"".</p> Yes, my, I was lazy. Because I wasn't up and I wasn't at the time. You know, and you know, they just said, they thought I didn't want to work. But at the time this happened, I had a full time job. You know, I was, you know, filling in helping them out and I asked, you know, didn't want to work Sunday nights because I had to get up and go to work on Monday morning at seven o'clock, seven thirty. But he wanted Sundays off. So, I mean it just, it, it, it irritates me to the point where you know, it's supposed to be their business, it's supposed to be family and this, you know the guy he's talking to is not even a manager, he's just a cook. He's not the kitchen manager. He doesn't have a manager title, he's an employee like myself. So, it, the first thing that ticked me off is, why are you consulting him? Why aren't you consulting my aunt who's a manager, or my cousin who's a manager? Why are you consulting him? You know, and my feeling is this. If they were going to lose me, they would rather lose me rather than four workers, three workers. (sigh) You know and to me that's hurtful. [00:45:10]</p> I do listen to it every time I listen to my voice-mails.</p> Not all the time, I mean I don't usually get, usually I answer my phone, but you know, whenever I check my voice-mails I'll, you know, that'll come up and I'll play that. And you know, it's just a reminder of...</p> Just what was going on and how they really think about me. You know, how he really perceives me, how he thinks you know, stuff goes on in the past, and how it's over, but from that message, from my perspective I know it's not over.</p> Ok.</p> Um, can we talk about you know, now that I don't have any money coming in, I'd hate to miss every week, but just for financial reasons I can still do the hundred dollars if it was every other week.</p> I will come next week, cuz I want to.</p> Thank you, I really appreciate it.</p>",2
1004478010.txt,"Hi. I forgot that ... I came at 8:20 instead of 8:30. Because ...</p> Yeah. So, I ... Hi.</p> How are you?</p> Good. Goodness. Sleepy. The girls keep getting sick and we're just sick all winter. It never stops. They got sick in October. We've just sick all through. Well, though ...</p> So Chris got his grades back on Friday and was not disappointed but he was ... we went to meet for dinner. He was going to check his grades because he knew they were coming out and he had been applying for jobs all last semester and missed so many classes.</p> Last year he was first in his class out of the whole law school which was really a big deal and exciting and you know fifth overall. So he was really proud of it and he got his grades back this semester and he's like ... he had a ... his GPA before was like a 3.9 something and it got brought down to 3.8. If you're not in the top fifteen you get bumped out of the ranking; you don't know your ranking anymore. So he told me he was going to ask if he was ranking and he said, ""Well I'm out of the top 15 people."" So he was all sulky all night. (Laugh) Not sulky, but like you know. He was in a bad mood. And so we went to dinner and we went home a watched a movie and like we're having some wine and for some reason his bad mood ... like when he gets in a bad mood I just have to then ... instead of talking about it I just get mean for some reason if I've had a few drinks. And so him and his friends were ... they're always like ... he and his guy friends think they're really funny and really amused by each other. And they're jokes back and forth to each other are always like, "" But I'm the best."" Or like, ""I'm the funniest."" And for some reason it annoys me.</p> Like get over yourselves. You guys are great, I love you all, but like, enough already because we get it, you guys are so great. And so I said something like just kind of cutting and mean for no reason, like I don't mean to say it. But I say it and of course like starts an argument. I said like, ""Why do you think you're so funny? Like you guys you know that other people laugh with their friends too. Other people are funny too."" And it started an argument. And then of course, you know he got mad, reasonably and then I just stopped talking. I just don't talk anymore. And then he ends up just leaving the room.</p> That's really bad. I just can't ... I mean this is the cycle that happened. This is not unusual. It's very typical actually. And so ... well the newer thing is me just not talking. Usually it would just keep escalating into a full-blown fight and yelling. But now instead what I do is I say something mean, he reacts, he says something mean back and then I just stop talking. And (pause) I don't know, I think there was some more layers to what happened just because (pause) but I just ... but that part in particular is something that doesn't ever change. It's really infuriating. It's infuriating for him. It makes him really frustrated and then there's nothing more I can say ... the only thing I can say the next day is like, ""I'm sorry."" I know. I don't know. I just do that and then what else do you say? You know it's like ... you know. I can only ... he just ... must be so frustrating for him because I just keep doing it. And it's frustrating for me too. I don't know like ... it's like I just can't help myself.</p> But ...</p> Well a couple of weeks ago, you know he ... my friends from back home, my guy friends, he doesn't like them and they're not very welcoming when the girls bring new guys around. They never have been. And so they're a little difficult and Chris has never really liked them and going into the situation he knows, you know with Fred being there and then I have some history with some of the other guys in my group of friends and that immediately makes him put his ... he just won't have anything to do with them. He doesn't want to have anything to do with them. He doesn't like them and he's told me, ""I just don't like your friends. Your friends suck. They're weak."" And I know it comes from his insecurity about my history with them. But it still ... these guys are still part of my life and still my friends and you know we have all moved on. Well maybe not me and Fred. But my other friends and I, you know they're engaged, I'm married, like there's no more history in this way. We had ... of my closest guy friends had just bought a house in (inaudible_00:06:25) over the summer with his fiancé and wanted us ... Chris and I to come out to visit for a weekend. I made the plans and then Chris just completed rejected it. He just wouldn't go.</p> And I ask him, ""Let's just go for a night. We'll drive up Saturday morning. We'll spend Saturday night, we'll leave Sunday morning."" And he just wouldn't do it and he just like, you know, ""Your friend Jed sucks and he's super weak. He's not nice to me. Like why should I be nice to this guy?"" So I was like, ""Oh my God just do it because he's a person in my life who I care about and I've made a huge effort for your friends who are now my friends because I've tried really hard and I just want the same courtesy back. I understand it's more difficult because I've slept with Jed, but that is in the past and I can't change that."" And so you know that happened over the summer and then by New years we were supposed to go to the same house and a lot of my friends from high school were going to be there and over the holidays Jed had seen Chris and said, ""Come to the New Years party. You guys are invited, we'd love to have you."" And Chris was like, ""I will never go to that New Years ... are you kidding me? No, not at all."" To me. He did say this to Brian.</p> But ... you know, obviously hurt my feelings. Again this is a situation where these are people in my life. This is one night, you know? I don't know why this is that big of a deal. And so, you know he ended up not coming and I went and you know even like that day that I was leaving he's saying like, ""This is totally inappropriate. Like I don't see why you think this is appropriate for you to do."" And I just don't agree. I just don't think it was inappropriate. He was invited. He could have come. He felt ... I think the only reason he thought it was inappropriate was because he didn't want to be in that situation. So I get really frustrated when he is openly very verbal how much he hates my friends. My girlfriends he likes just fine. And he, you know things that they're fine. But he'll just attack, you know my friends and say that they're whatever they are. So when I hear talking about with his friends or about his friends I'm like, I love his friends and so the thing is I really like them and I really get along with all of them. But as soon as he starts in or I hear any of them joking around about like, ""We're the tightest."" Like, ""We're so cool."" Like it just gets under my skin because I know how great they think they are. (Chuckle) And even though I think they're great too when Chris is so openly negative about my friends it's like, ""Uh.""</p> Yeah. Right. So I just ... I think that that's where that was coming from.</p> I know. I know it's like ... and they're joking. They always say they're joking. That's what they now say it's a joke. But it's like it can't be that much of a joke if that's like you guys constant jokes back and forth to each other. It just gets under my skin. (Laugh) It didn't get under my skin before he was openly negative about the people in my life. And that's when it started to bother me. And the next day I explained that to him and I said you know, ""Obviously this looks like it completely came out of the blue. And it did completely come out of the blue. I just was trying ... I just got a jab in. But I think it was because of this like, you know now this feeling that I have that these people in my life suck in your opinion and you and your friends are so great. And so I just feel defensive and I feel insulted by it.""</p> Yeah. I don't really feel like I can. He ... we have like a pretty different history. Just ... I was very promiscuous and I was with a lot of people before starting to see Chris and that's something that (pause) is a little embarrassing for me because I know I was doing out of insecurity for myself. And just like just sort of eager. I'm not very proud of. And a lot of people that I've been with either he knows or are my friends or he knows a lot of the people. And so ... but Chris on the other hand hasn't been with hardly anybody. And he's has a very different history and so I don't have to be around people that he's been with and I don't have to see his ex's and I don't have to see his one-night stands or you know, I don't have to deal with any of that. Everybody that ... they're all in Washington where he went to college and so it's not anything that exists in our life. But my history does really exist in our life. In California and in Massachusetts and (pause) and I think that his lack of experience I guess or dating history or whatever before we got together is an insecurity of his and my other extreme is an insecurity of mine. So because of that its just not really talked about openly. When we talk about it it's like vague. Like vague ways of saying things. Like it would never be like, ""I ain't going to a party with a guy you slept with."" It would never be that. It would be like, ""Do you think that's okay for you to be there with him?"" It's just implied instead of like being actually said. And we just don't talk about me as in my ... I don't know. Not that I necessarily want to talk about it. But I think that there's things there that still come up and aren't really resolved for him and maybe for me either.</p> I used to be really embarrassed about my past like, mortified. And now it's just for me it's just kind of like something that happened and that I can't change and that kind of understand why it happened. You know I realized that I was just trying to be validated from all these different guys. So I understand that and it's less embarrassing for me now and more just (pause) a phase that happened. Not that I'm proud of it but it's just not something that really like tears me up inside like it used to. But I think it really bothers him. I don't know.</p> No. I think ... what I think and I don't know we've talked about it. But I think that he thinks that I was a slut. And that I was like just had really bad behavior. (Chuckle) And that that's kind of embarrassing for him. I think that ...</p> Oh, no.</p> No. No don't. And like, no he's never said that to me but it's just what I think is probably his feeling on the situation. I think that he has his own feelings about his history but I don't think they're really, to me, I don't think like compares them. I think that ... I don't know. Because like, you know all his friends growing up were all like, you know had girlfriends or whatever and Chris just didn't. And then you know had a couple of girls he went on dates with. And then there was me and then we got married. And so I think for him that's his own thing separate from me at least. I don't know that.</p> Yeah.</p> Exactly.</p> Mm-hm. Yeah. Exactly. And then it just, you know and then it manifests in this like relationship that he doesn't have with my friends and it just ... it's just there. Just ... and then I go ... then I guess like, I guess my feeling is like, ""What is there to say?"" So like I think sometimes about like you know about talking about it but feel like he'll probably just shutdown. I don't know what ... like what is there to say anymore? You know like I could say, ""I don't think you like my friends because I've been with some of them."" And then, and then what? You know then he'll just say, ""Yeah. You know I don't like it."" And then what? (Chuckle) And so ... I don't know. I guess like since we've got into this we talked about it early in our relationship and then you know it kind of come up and then we got engaged and we got married. And then after you're married it's kind of like, ""Well what's the point? Like why do we need to talk about this?"" I'm like ...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah. That's true. I also (chuckle) not that this matters. But when we first starting dating his best friend, Jay, who had kind of hooked us up, they're our friends that live here now. He had said to me like, ""Just so you know I think Chris is a virgin."" And I was like ... I said, ""No he's not. There's no way."" And he said, ""Yeah, seriously. He went away to school in Washington and like we'd heard about some girls but we think Chris ... Chris has never talked to us about girls. So we think Chris is a virgin."" And I was very far from that and so I was kind of ... he and I never talked about it. We just went on with that stuff. And I asked him later, like, ""Have you been with other girls?"" And he said, ""Yes."" And he told me there were these three girls and he told me about them. But I've always kind ... it was really early and I've always kind of wondered if he was telling me the truth or not. Because ... and not that it matters really. I mean it does matter. But I just always wondered how true that was. I've asked him, you know we had had that conversation and then I asked him later like, ""Were you telling me the truth like had you really?"" And he said, ""Yes."" And so I feel like if I keep bringing it up like ... you know he's already told me two times that's not the case. But I've always kind of suspected like ... I don't know maybe (pause) I just don't know. I don't know why that would matter to me either.</p> So ...</p> Yeah.</p> Well, yeah. I feel like he's going like that those are negative feelings that he has about me. I feel like ... I don't think any husband wants to talk about like how many people their wife's been with before. And so, I feel like I don't want to bring up this ... these negative feelings he's got about me. And this idea of this person that I was before hand. That's not a cute person. (Laugh) That's not a good look. So part of me feels weird about bringing it up for that reason.</p> I don't want you to remember this person that I was before. Remember how I was. But you're right it does come up ... it comes up with just my (pause) just my personality and how I am. I mean, you know when we're out with our friends and I like, you know I'm hugging his friends and I'm like you know ... our friends and like you know, my old roommate who's a guy and I like had a relationship for a little bit and that's how I am and that's just my nature. And it's seems inappropriate and I don't if those things are inappropriate or not but just that's who I am. I know that he feels so uncomfortable with it because he knows who I used to be and how I used to be and that type of behavior was just lead to me getting a bunch of guys. And so I think when we're out and he sees me acting like that, acting all flirty and like I'm flirting with girls too, that's just my ... that's what he sees and he sees like ... I'm just being how I used to be. I think at least. Because he gets really mad about it. (Pause)</p> And I know that I need to obviously change certain types of behavior because they make him uncomfortable. But certain types of behavior I just think like, ""That's just me."" And at a certain point like I do like that I'm really affectionate and I do like to hug my friends and I do like to ... that's just who I am and that's just how I am. And so yes there are probably certain things that I should (inaudible_00:24:41). But for the most part I like that about myself. I like that my friends know that I love them and I show them and so there are certain things that I just think like I don't want to change that and I do like that about myself. And so ... I don't know. (Pause) And those are things that he can't really change. Me touching (laugh), that kind of stuff. And that, he can't really ... he thinks that whenever I'm being touchy and being like, you know when I'm hugging everybody and you know he thinks that's flirting. And that's just how I am. It's not flirting when I do it to my brothers or my sister. It's just who I am. Just how I interact. But for him, he doesn't like any of that and so it's ... I don't know. I think he only sees it when I'm doing it with other guys. He doesn't see it when I'm like, ""So you're my girlfriend holding her hand."" Or like sitting ... those are blocked to him and he only sees it when I'm doing this. And I think it's because this history that I have. So I guess I'm proving to myself how important it is that we talk about this. But it just feels so weird to bring it up out of the blue and just say, ""I think we should talk about this.""</p> I don't know. It's a good question. I don't know if that's about ... (pause) I think part of it is just, you know I loose my filter and then the things that I've been thinking bubble right up to the surface. I don't know but I definitely have a few drinks and then say mean things and it's reaction based. I feel like at least. It may not be, I might just be a mean person. But I feel like the next morning when I'm thinking about it, I think like, ""Why did I do that? Like where did that come from? That was ... what is that?"" Like you know I've told that I said things that I just like do not think or feel or just saying things to say them. And I think I'm just trying to get a reaction. (Pause) I don't know why though. I mean, I guess it's just like the stupidest thing; it's why everything is so stupid. It's just, like it's everything my dad was mean to me so then I'm going to do bad stuff. I feel like, like everything can't be that.</p> Yeah. But it sounds so stupid. It's like I can't blame everything in my life on like my dad was a bad guy who did mean things to me and so I'm (pause) how bad can that be really? Everything can't come down to that. Like I feel frustrated. (Pause)</p> I don't want it to I guess. I'm it does seem logically possible. And I see it and that's what I think it is. But it sounds so corny when I say it out loud and sounds so just, just so stupid.</p> I don't know, it sounds like a 'Lifetime' movie. Sounds like (laugh) (pause)</p> I know.</p> They really are and it sounds like I'm just blaming everything on it and I hate that. I don't want ... I just don't want to blame everything on stuff that happened when I was a kid. Like I'm so over it. (Pause) I just don't think ...</p> No I don't ... (pause) but it's still frustrating. (Sniffling)</p> It frustrating that I guess like it has this much weight still. And that you'd think like you'd think like I'm aware of this problem. And I have an idea of where it comes from but I have an idea of what my triggers are. And here comes the problem again and again and again and again and again and again. And you ... just happens like I just think like (pause) ""Okay so you have an idea of where it comes from. You have an idea of the things that you do to get you to that place, why does it keep happening."" And that's just frustrating to me.</p> I don't know. Like why do I want Joe to be mad at me? There's no like ... why would I want that? I just don't know why I want that.</p> (sigh) He just would say really mean things and just act like a lunatic. Just shove you for no reason. Just be walking ... just would try to ... he was just scary. He would be scary to be scary. You know there was just a layer of fear that always existed just, you know just don't step out of line because you don't know what will happen. And he never like lost it, like beat me up. But like, there were, you know shove me down the stairs for no reason or like spankings when I was little like weren't really ... I don't know I think just like smacking a kid isn't really a spanking that's just getting hit. Just doing scary things for no reason. Chasing your dog with a chainsaw and telling us he was going to cut its head off. Like just doing scary things and being scary. And just ... anytime you watch somebody beat your mom up likes it's not anybody you want to be around. You know he would pull guns on the whole family; he would tell us he was going to kill all of us and just do scary things and be a mean guy. Just because he liked control and power and he's just unhappy and he's a drug addict. But ... (pause) I don't know.</p> When we're little he would come home from the bars and he would just wham on my mom or just do really terrible things and it he would be screaming bloody murder. (Crying) and I would just listen all night long. And then go into my brother's room and I would stand in front of the door and make sure they didn't come out. He just ... he was just always there beating me. (Pause) (Heavy sigh) (Pause) He told my brothers that I was responsible for the divorce. That was the big thing too when we were older. He would always tell them that I was the reason that everything was so bad at home. Because I would instigate stuff with him. He would come home (pause) at you know 3 a.m. and he would sit in the kitchen above my bedroom every single night and make steak. Then he would sit in this one squeaky chair he had and watch T.V. and he would squeak the chair. And I would wake up and I would come upstairs and I would start screaming at him. And he and I would scream at each other and you know (pause) and that's just how every night went. And then you know and he would say things to my brothers like, ""Jenny's a real bitch. Like she's the reason your mom and I have so many problems and ..."" (sniffling) That's why my brothers and I had a hard time getting along for a while.</p> Because you know they resented me and tension I was creating. You know I'm fully aware of the fact that my dad was the bad guy in the situation. But it still, it's a weird power that is given to you when your dad tells you at thirteen years old that you're the reason that everything in the family is going wrong and the thing is it never made me feel bad. I didn't feel bad about it. I thought, ""Great. I make this bad enough for you; if you hate me enough you'll leave. Good. Go."" And that's all I thought. I didn't have this guilt where I felt like, ""Oh my parents ... I hope I'm not responsible for whatever it's worth."" I wanted to be responsible.</p> Mm-hm.</p> That's how I felt. My brothers didn't see it the same way because, you know he paid attention to them and he would throw the ball with them and do ... he still was scary and he still would do weird stuff like I'd come into the kitchen and he'd have my baby brother, five years old, both hands on his head and he's smacking him against sliding glass door for no reason. Like he'd still do weird stuff like that but he'd pay attention to them and like, you know play sports with them and tell them they were like ... you know he lives vicariously through my brother's career. He was really into. But for them they saw it like, ""Why are you making our dad this bad guy?"" And for me I always knew my dad's a bad guy whether I'm here or not. Like I want him to go. And I could ... you know he left when I was five for a year and he left when I was ten for a year. And even though we were alone for year and it was hard I loved it. I mean my mom probably didn't love it because it was hard. But whenever he came back it was awful. I wanted him to just go. But it is a weird, senseless power of control that you give to this, you know to this ... you know as a kid it is a weird sense of power that I felt like, ""I'm responsible for this?"" Then it's mixed bags. It's like; ""Well I'm not that responsible because you're not going.""</p> For work?</p> I don't know. I don't know.</p> Well she had to work a lot and when my dad came back the ... after my grandpa died when we were ten we had a lot of money but he still made my mom work. And so we would be at home alone and he would be there sometimes. And so that would always be bad. And then you know when stuff would happen she was there, she'd come you know like when I'd wake them up in the night like eventually she'd wakeup and she'd come out and then there'd be the whole family and everybody ... it's three in the morning and we're all standing in the kitchen screaming. And so she'd be there for the most part. Yeah I think she was just, you know I think she was just at a loss, like what ... you know eventually she gave him the ultimatum when I was fifteen and she said either you have to go rehab or you have to go. And he chose to go. And so that's just how he left it. But he didn't leave still ... I mean he left but he just continued to torment us for the next year. Just super scary. Like having to call the cops if he would just show up. We'd have to run all around the house locking all of the doors and sliding glass doors everywhere. And we would know when he was coming and then we would finally lock all the doors around the house and then we'd go to the basement and he would just stand at the door and he would just pound on the door for hours like a psycho. (Chuckle) And it was just so bazaar.</p> It doesn't even seem like real life any more. So it was like so far away. (Sigh)</p> It wasn't very nice.</p> It certainly wasn't normal. (Sniffling) Yeah. So I'm a little damaged. (Chuckle)</p> Just it's not a normal experience. Just feel a little bit cheeky because of all of that.</p> I don't know, I just feel broken. Like I was never put together right. (Pause) Like I didn't get the chance to (pause) like to make myself, to like heal from what happened when I was younger. It'd have to be like a whole person to begin with. (Chuckle) (Sniffling) I feel like I never got the chance to be a whole person. Like I was always just turmoiled. There was always something with it. I'm not (inaudible_00:42:02). But I feel like it was just always shaky and I've always have just been shaky and I'm trying to not be anymore. But I don't know. (Pause)</p> Just empty and stuff. Just missing pieces. I just don't trust anybody. I don't ... I don't know. I just don't trust myself. I don't trust other people. Just feels like black inside. (Sniffling) Like everything other than sadness I don't feel genuinely. (Pause) Like this feels real. This feels like (pause) this feels okay for some reason. But other stuff doesn't feel quite real. Like it feels fake. (Sniffling) And I don't ... that's not normal. I know that's not normal.</p> Like this is what I would be most comfortable doing all day. (Laugh) Just sitting here and talking about everything bad. That would make me more comfortable than like sitting at my friend's house and watching football all day yesterday.</p> I got ... and I don't know why.</p> Yeah. But what is that? Like why would I rather sit in a room and cry all day than go and be at my friend's house? (Crying) I don't like that. (Pause)</p> Yeah. (Crying) But I don't want to feel like that forever.</p> (Crying) We have to stop, huh?</p> Yeah.</p> Okay. Thanks.</p> (inaudible_00:44:49).</p> I got your stool a little wet.</p> All right.</p> Thanks very much.</p>",0
1000094790.txt,"Hello.</p> Hi, hello.</p> I'm doing ok. </p> Yep. I'm preparing, doing all kinds of research for the trip that we're going to take and getting excited about that. </p> Since I lose weight so exceptionally slowly, what it'll be a year of abstinence in August?</p> You know I've only lost ten pounds. (chuckles) I mean obviously you know I'm not getting enough cardio exercise. And  the other day I was in that cardio class and my knees started to kill me so I quit doing that. And I went back to Yoga again. </p> But I think when I start doing more cardio, I'll start losing a little more weight. </p> I feel like most of the time I'm mid-moderate. Sometimes I'm high moderate, you know. </p> Oh yeah. Yeah. He prescribed the homeopathic hormone drops. And he's also got me on folic acid, and some Vitamin B's. </p> I believe so, yeah.</p> Since they didn't mention it I'm assuming it was fine.</p> I know the thyroid was ok. . </p> The adrenals I don't know. I don't know if I specifically asked them to check for those or not. Does he, what do they check for when you send your sample in? </p> Yeah I did. </p> They know I'm a client of yours. </p> Well you know I did it, what, last year. I did it I think July or August. And then I didn't do it again until a couple of months ago. </p> Yeah.</p> The things he's given me I have, yeah. </p> I don't even know if it's been two months. Probably you know maybe a month.</p> The drops and the folic acid and the vitamins.</p> Because I don't know if you remember. I talked to you after Heather said you know he told her she was insulin resistant.</p> Right. I mean it was funny. Because it was a double edged sword. Because in a way I was almost hoping that I was, but then hoping I wasn't.</p> If I was pre-diabetic or insulin resistant it would be like, ""Well, now I have to do something,"" you know? </p> But there wasn't any of that... which I'm actually extremely grateful for. </p> I don't want to be diabetic. </p> Or pre-diabetic.</p> Well that's true.  You know I still have the temptation to just have somebody give me my food. You know something like a Nutrisystem or something.</p> That's a place I can't be. </p> Yeah.</p> Um hmm.</p> Definitely.</p> And we're doing a whole week of this place where there's Yoga.</p> Yoga and hiking</p> So yeah, I'm planning on getting a lot of exercise. </p> Right, right. </p> But yeah, we plan on doing a lot of walking. </p> Yeah. </p> Like step class.</p> So that's hard for me. And then you know, after a while I feel like you know my knees are hurting and on fire.</p> It's like ugh.</p> No. </p> Right, right.</p> Yeah. </p> Right. </p> Um hmm.</p> Right. </p> Well I don't know what the huge resistance is for me. I think it's probably laziness or I don't know. But that's how I lost 60 pounds several years ago. And more than anything it was that I walked seven days a week. </p> Yeah. </p> An hour. </p> Ok. </p> Right, oh yeah. </p> Yeah, on vacation</p> Yeah, I just have to do it. Yes it's possible. </p> Uh huh. </p> If I carve out a specific time of day you know, and try and get my husband in on it so I have a partner... that would be the best. You know that's how it worked for me before. I had girlfriends that we would just meet every morning at different places and that was highly motivating to know that I was going to meet somebody else. </p> Passive. We've done it you know, we'll do it for a while and then we'll quit. </p> Ok. </p> Ok. </p> No, that was a whole different town. </p> Not off the top of my head. Not with people's schedules, no.</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah.</p> A schedule book, yes. </p> Ok. </p> I'd have to think about that a little bit because I have to work around my clients. Or else I have to make the time I walk, you know I have to schedule that in and then schedule my clients around that., which is probably what I would have to do to make it really consistent. </p> No, between eight and five. </p> Eight and five thirty, yeah.</p> Well nine to five thirty. </p> I get up about seven and I go to bed, try and go to bed about ten. </p> Well, the problem with right now is it's really cold.</p> At morning and at night. So you know the best time would probably be in later afternoon when it's a little bit warmer.</p> Because it's like zero degrees in the morning and at night. </p> Now that's not real motivating to get out there. (chuckles)</p> So I'd rather you know, at least it warms up to about 30, 32 on a nice day this time of year and it's tolerable. </p> Yeah, outside.</p> That would be probably the best because then you don't get bored. </p> Yeah. Even noon. You know even like noon or something would probably work. </p> No. Right now that would work.</p> His schedule varies as well. But most of the time he is at work. Yeah. </p> Yeah, I can do that. </p> Not necessarily. </p> You want me to do that right now?</p> Ok. I could do it; I couldn't do it at noon tomorrow. But I could do it at 2:00.</p> Tomorrow.</p> And I can't do it Wednesday until, well no Wednesday is not really good. Thursday I could do it, well I'm not sure because I might have clients book on Thursday morning so I'm not sure about Thursday of this week. Friday I could do it after like 1:30. </p> Definitely. I'll put that in. And so for this week I could do Tuesday and Friday. </p> Possibly Thursday. </p> No, Sunday I'm committed to something else but Saturday I could. Any time on Saturday I think we could both do it. </p> Yeah. Well I have three times. I have Tuesday, Friday and now Saturday. </p> I need a fourth time. </p> Which I could possibly do on Thursday, yeah. </p>",0
1000122436.txt,"Because I know seven years ago my father was in therapy with the same program?</p> And she said she didn't even notice the camera.</p> No, because this camera is [inaudible0:00:22]</p> Any pointed questions or?</p> I filled out two pretty big questionnaires. </p> OK.</p> OK.</p> All right. I feel depressed. Ha ha. I think that I have probably been depressed since I got back from Columbia the first time I was there.</p> I've been there twice. I did my last semester abroad in Columbia and I got back from that about three and a half years ago. And I came back and I think at that point I started to feel depressed. I didn't quite know if I wanted to be in Chicago, or if I wanted to go somewhere else. I didn't know if maybe I would be happier in San Diego. [0:02:19]</p> Those sorts of issues. And then I was always looking to leave again. So I went to South America, which I was planning, on doing since I came back anyway, because I wanted to do more extensive traveling. I was just basically focused on Columbia the first time. And then I went to... I feel kind of funny. I'm just like, ""I don't know what I'm talking about.""</p> Yeah. I don't know. </p> I don't know, I just feel funny. [giggles] I'm just nervous, because I've been in therapy before but it has always been with the same therapist. That I've had since I was fifteen years old. So on and off I've been in therapy with her so it is just a whole different experience. I mean I've been in therapy but just with...</p> Right. </p> I just felt like I need to break from the past a little bit and move on. Because he knows me and he knows my family, my mother had been in therapy with him. I felt like it would be a good thing. Plus the last time I was in therapy with him and it was about fifteen sessions and I just didn't find them helpful. And my mother had been in this program and she told me that it was really good for her so...</p> All right. Let me get back to Columbia.</p> Yeah, it was just like I started talking and I went, ""Oh, here I went to Columbia.""</p> Yes. So I took another trip... Not that I should go to my mother's died of cancer and this has been an issue with me for the past five years...</p> That's there too. There are a lot of things that are there. Probably my relationships with people. My relationship with my best friend, who has been my best friend since junior high, there's definitely some issues there I'd like to get into.</p> Samantha, Sam.</p> And Sam just got married when she was in Columbia. We were together in Columbia, we went there together and I left probably about three months ago. And she got married in my last month. And so she's down there. And that probably there is some issues with my father that I would like to get into. I have a great relationship with my father, but sometimes... My parents were divorced when I was about eight years old and sometimes I feel like it is too much and I feel- I don't want to do anything that could possibly disappoint her. </p> Yes. Sometimes I feel like he's very on top of me. And then if he's with a girlfriend and women that I definitely have a problem with relationships with men. I don't feel very comfortable around men. A lot of times. A lot of times. </p> Cut and dry, yeah. It has been three months and he hasn't written to me at all. </p> It hurts.</p> [Inaudible 0:07:34] My father hates him right now so he doesn't want to hear anything good about him, so I can't talk anything good about him around him. Because when I came back I was pregnant and I had an abortion. And he's just angry at him because, he, you know, one of his old girlfriends had a couple of abortions in the past and she thinks it was really irresponsible of him and he realizes I played a part in it, but he's very, very angry with him. So I can't really discuss it with him unless I'm ready to be angry with him and just say horrible things about him, and he prefers to hear that but...</p> Yes, because if- My friend Mary who became a very good friend of mine when we came to Columbia the first time is also a very good friend of this person and she, a couple of nights ago I'm on the phone with her and she said, ""Well, I can imagine that your father would be very angry, but just remember that you know, I would hate him too, and I would be very angry with him too, but I know him and I know he's a very good person or whatever."" I tried to tell my father that and he said, ""Oh, he's a good person? Oh gosh, blah blah blah..."" So you can't really say anything good about him around him. [0:09:00]</p> It was just very hurtful, because when I left it was kind of like, he's more of a person that it is hard for him to share things. And he'd turn on the TV and he'd tune me out a lot of times. And when I was upset about something it was kind of like, ""All right, what else?"" kind of thing.</p> Yes, he worked all day long and then he came home and we'd have dinner. And then we'd talk for a while and then he would watch TV. And this one particular night I was expecting my friends to visit me, because I was originally living elsewhere and then I moved in to be with him. I lived with him for probably only a month and a half before I left.</p> Carlos. So this particular night, or this weekend, I was expecting my friends to come visit me. I was pretty alone accept for him, because I'd never been in this town, all my friends were in a different place, and it was just basically him that I had there and that's why I was there. And my friends didn't arrive and they hadn't called, so I didn't know what was going on and so I tried to call one of them, Sam. I tried to call Samantha. And the woman that answered the phone three times said that she was going to try to get her and then there were seven to ten minutes of silence and she wouldn't come back to the phone. So I hung up and would try again. </p> I was alone and I was trying to reach her and I couldn't. This woman was being very uncooperative and wasn't helping. So I went back into the bedroom and he was watching TV and I started to go off. ""Oh my God, this woman!"" and blah blah blah. ""Want to reach Sam and I can't."" And he was like, ""Mmm,"" and kept watching TV. So I went back into the living room and I was very upset and that was the first night I slept in another room. I took a nap in the living room then I went back to bed. He was sleeping and he was snoring so I went into the farther room. I got on the phone with Samantha and I was able to talk to her. [0:11:34]</p> Yes, well I was pissed off with him because what had happened earlier. Basically he had just fazed me out and I left. When I came back in the room he was sleeping and I was just sort of, I was still pissed off with him and I didn't want to sleep next to him probably. I mean, he snores every night, but this night it bothered me. So I just left. That was that, I was just pissed up because of what earlier had happened.</p> Yes. Now I feel a little sad. Yes.</p> Well, throughout. I just forgot it while I was talking. I was just kind of like on a rampage.</p> That's a little bit of Carlos. Everyday I think about him on the train back to Glencoe Park, ""there's going to be a letter there.""</p> Yes. Definitely. When I left, he said he was going to come in October and we were going to spend the month together in October, and if he feels like he wants to change, he feels like he could change in the United States. Because maybe the tables would be turned, like maybe he would be more likely to be more open if he was here, because he would be more needing of it. Whereas there I was more alone and needy. And he thought- by the end it seemed like that was what he wanted to do before we left. He was like, ""Yeah, I want to change. I want to come in October and spend the month with you and by the end of my work contract, if I felt comfortable in the United States I would come back."" [0:15:36]</p> I don't know if I want him to come now. I don't know if I want to open that book again, maybe I need to just close it. But if he came, it could be a way of closing it, but I don't know if that would be a lot more difficult for me. Because I don't think it would work at this point. I had hopes that it could work, but I don't know if it could work at this point, so I don't know if I want to get involved again. I just have to...</p> Yes. </p> I feel like there's so much. I'm just getting to where I don't feel like I'm on a trail here. </p> For now. So what else?</p> Sure. That might be easier for me.</p> That's fine for now. I want to move into the city. But at this point there's no way. I have no friends in Chicago right now. Last year when I came back I lived with my father for about a year. And then I got an apartment in the city with a friend and another person who I know through my father who is a friend. Actually all our fathers went to high school together and one of them I've been close to since I was twelve, on and off we've been friends. And the other one I'd met a couple of times and she was looking for an apartment so the three of us lived together. And now, Isabelle who was a good friend of mine, still is, and her boyfriend Dave who also lived with us, they're in Oregon now, so there's really no one around. So I'm trying to see before I call people from the voice ads, if there's someone who knows someone. [0:18:28]</p> I started getting irritable, really irritable with my father. I was just like, I get pissy a lot.</p> I just kind of, I don't know, just pissy. Just like, he would irritate me. ""Get away."" So we have a really great relationship and it got a lot better when I left. I was definitely very irritable and that started to eat at him.</p> Yes. Because it was nothing he was doing. He wasn't doing anything bad. I was just frustrated with the situation and he was the closest person. And so that was it. But...</p> Yeah, he tends to be. Probably. He is very on top of me, especially when I'm not feeling good. He's always around the corner like, ""Are you OK? Are you OK?""</p> Yes. I mean he's wonderful. We have a great relationship, but probably it feels like sometimes just too much.</p> Too much. It is just like, ""Relax, we're going to make mistakes, but we have to make them."" I said to him one point when he had visited me in Peru, which I was actually planning on coming back from Colombia, I kind of went for a loop there, I was planning on coming back from Colombia in May, and at that point I had told my father I was planning on coming back. I had written Carlos a letter because he was living in Bogot�, kind of explaining how I felt about him and wondering because it always felt like there was something mutual with him, and just wondering what was going on with that. Just saying, ""You know, this is really driving me nuts, I just feel like I need to express this to you."" [0:21:56] </p> Yes. I didn't want to say it. He played... at that point I probably knew what I was going to do and what I wanted to do, go back to Colombia. But at that point I didn't want to make the decision because I felt like my father would just be so disappointed in me. </p> Yes. He said to me over the phone, I told him. He said, ""You with all your women's lib stuff and you're going back to Colombia to be with a man!"" And I was like, ""Whoa!"" And I knew he would be... [0:23:28]</p> Yes. And so I didn't want to make a decision that I didn't, I probably didn't want to make a decision before I saw him, so that he wouldn't judge me for it, and not think I'm a flake that can't get my life together and I just decided to stay in Colombia for a man. So I probably didn't want to make the decision before I saw him even.</p> The first phone call he was pretty much a wreck. I called him back when I got to Brazil, which was about five days later, and he said, ""I talked to your uncle and he said, just go down to Peru to talk to her and find out what's going on."" He said, ""There's a lot that I don't understand and I just want to come down and talk about it."" So we met up in Peru, and spent a week together.</p> I was happy. I was happy he decided to come.</p> Well, I hadn't seen him in a year or so, so I was happy to see him. And I wanted to explain what was going on with me in person. And I wanted to see what he would say. I wanted his approval and I thought that I could get it more easily if I saw him face to face also.</p> Yeah. I was scared, too. I was like, ""You guys, He's coming to Peru to drag me away!"" And my friends said, ""Don't worry, we're not going to let him take you!"" But...</p> But he remained pretty neutral. He was kind of like, ""This is the way it is, and this is the way I am."" Later on he told me he knew I was going to come back to Colombia. But then he was like, ""Travel a little while, you don't have to make the decision now, travel a little while, see how you feel, take yourself out of Colombia and see how you feel."" And he said to me when I talked to him on the phone in Brazil, ""Oh it will be helpful to see your father, you can talk to him and see what he thinks."" But he knew I was [inaudible phrase 0:26:13] And I knew it too.</p> But I just needed to... Like, my father was a major decision in all this. I knew what I wanted to do, but I just had to get by this father thing.</p> I wanted to see what he thought, I wanted to see how bad he would think of me. And probably, I don't know, I mean I probably would have ended up doing the same thing anyway, but I wanted to see. I wanted to get a more clear feeling of what I was going to do, probably.</p> Pretty much. Well, not approval. At no point did I feel approval. I mean he wasn't like, ""Go ahead and do it, that's fine."" But he was kind of like, ""Go ahead and do it that's fine."" After a while. We kind of discussed, and he was kind of like, ""Well, you need to do what you're going to do. But this is how I feel about it. I don't think this is right."" The other thing he said to me was, I was having a hard time with my best friend Samantha, and after a while he started saying, ""Well, I think maybe you think this is a good healing thing for you to do. Go...""</p> ""Go be with Carlos, feel appreciated by your peers. I know it is different with your father and with your family is different. But maybe you feel like you need to go with this person and feel appreciated."" At that point, he had met Carlos once the first time I was in Colombia, the first time I came to visit. He had met him and from what I told him about him, he had really liked him a lot. He liked him a lot. And he kind of felt, ""Oh good, go there, and he's going to give you a lot of attention, he's going to give you a lot of positive feedback. So go. I feel like maybe that's even what you're going for."" And he kind of felt like, ""Maybe you just need to go and do that."" [0:28:20]</p> Because there was a lot of stuff going on with Samantha. I think it was probably a hard time for the four of us. It was Sam, Kelly, Trish and I. And Samantha, Trish and I had traveled to Central America together and Colombia together and things got difficult for each of us in different ways. And then she got involved with this person and I felt pretty abandoned, pretty bad, because I was pretty depressed at that point too. And she wasn't spending a lot of time with me at all; she was just kind of with this guy...</p> With this guy that she got married to, who is a great person, really great person...</p> Yes. That was a big issue for me. </p> Well he did stay that way. He never stopped saying those things. He was definitely, right to the end, ""I want you to come home because this is what you need to do, you need to go to school, and you need to get your life together."" Whatever. He stuck with that stuff. But then I got a little bit of approval that ""Maybe this will be a good thing for you, to be with someone who appreciates you.""</p> I don't know. I probably would have gone to Colombia still.</p> I would have felt horrible.</p> I would have felt like I was a big disappointment to my father. Like I was a flake that was running after some guy to South America. </p> Kind of like a flake maybe, kind of up in the air, think that, well, he did kind of think about what I was doing with my life in South America.</p> Yes. I wouldn't say at this point that he thinks it is a Disappointment that I spent a year in South America and didn't do much. I worked, I traveled, I saw a lot. But I'm trying to...</p> not anything! I did work! </p> Yes.</p> I don't know I just need his approval.</p> Yes. I really need his approval, it is very, very important to me. I get upset. I can feel it. Like a couple nights ago. I think he's not crazy about my friend Trish at this point.</p> Yes, Trish is back in the States. He's not crazy about my friend Trish, and he... Trish called me a couple of nights ago, and my father was already in bed, it was probably 10:30. And I talked to Trish downstairs, and when I came back upstairs I felt like there was something weird in his tone of voice, like he was like, ""Are you talking to Trish?"" Which isn't really the case and whatever. But I kind of felt like a tone of whatever. </p> Just that, ""He doesn't approve. He's upset with me.""</p> What is she doing being friends with this person. I don't know. I can't think of anything too horrible.</p> Something like that, something like, ""What is she doing? She doesn't know what she's doing, this person."" It is just like, maybe if he doesn't approve than maybe what I'm doing just isn't right. Like I'm bad if my father doesn't approve.</p> Sort of. Sort of.</p> Not bad, but not OK. There's something wrong if my father doesn't approve. There's something wrong with me if my father doesn't approve of everything I'm doing at each moment in my life. </p> But he generally does really approve of me.</p> [Giggling 0:34:59]</p> He does approve of me! No, he does though. I just felt for a second like I was trying to convince you again, but I wasn't.</p> She doesn't. That's not how she feels. But I'm just like really, I don't know, proving to myself that he was way too important to me.</p> Yes.</p> It is a strange combination I guess. </p> I don't know. I don't really have any thoughts on that particular relationship between those things. </p> I don't know, I just don't. What a question.</p> Yes, men. I feel uncomfortable around them.</p> Men.</p> It is OK. </p> Yes. It is OK.</p> Yes. I mean probably, to be honest, which I am embarrassed to say so, I didn't really know what to expect and at first and you called and you were a man, I was like, ""Oh God, it is a man."" I wanted it to be a woman. And when Trish said to me, ""Is it going to be a woman?"" Because it is important for her too, in that kind of a situation, we share those feelings. She said, ""Did you ask for a woman?"" And I said, ""No, I didn't ask for a woman because I should probably deal with it if it is a man anyway, if I have such issues with men I should probably just deal with it anyway."" So, and I didn't even know if I even wanted a man. I sort of wanted a man and I sort of didn't. So when you came up and I thought, ""He's a young, good looking man,"" and I thought, ""Oh no! This is the worst thing."" So...</p> Yes, but I'm OK with it. </p> At first when I was sitting there I thought, ""Oh Shit."" But now I feel fine.</p> You mean like before, the crying and then... I don't know. Why, do you think I go up and down a lot?</p> I don't really know.</p> I don't know, it is just like initial reactions and then I can just open up and think clearly again.</p> So which of the three techniques are...</p> No, that's good.</p> Yes. Because that is like... I mean, I'm not a nut case with men, but I'm definitely very nervous around men. I would like to explore my relationship with men as well. Because I don't know, I just have problems with relationships with men.</p> Yes.</p> Nowhere. </p> You said that you were a Psychologist intern.</p> So how many years have you studied?</p> Where are you studying?</p> I live right near Loyola.</p> OK. And you just got involved with this program?</p> OK. </p> Yes, it makes me a little nervous.</p> I don't know. It is like, all of my little mannerisms; all my little body language or whatever is being recorded.</p> In the preliminary interviews, I didn't know where to look. Because a lot of times she was reading questions and we wouldn't be having eye contact. So I was like, ""Where do I look? Her outfit is nice. Or those are the books, or Hi."" That sort of thing. </p> I'll get used to it, I'm sure. I just didn't expect it to be in this room. And when my mother told me she wasn't aware of the camera at all, like it was some kind of little thing in the corner hidden somewhere that she wasn't even aware of, I thought that would be the situation. So when I came in here I saw the camera very clearly.</p> The other thing is, that I forgot to bring the money today. </p> I have about half of it, and I just forgot, I'm sorry. </p> Well today I was in the field so [inaudible 0:46:25]</p>",0
1004687726.txt,"So I received two phone calls of rejection this morning. I am really glad they called today and not over the weekend or last week, because I had a really good morning, especially the last four or five days. And I have—I feel like, I spent the last few days being like, ""OK, I know I didn't get this job. These are all the reasons why that's a good thing,"" and so forth and so on. And both of them were like, ""We really, really want you to stay in touch with us in the future."" So, yeah, that was nice. But, yeah. If they called Friday, it would've been death (laughs), even though I really wanted them to call on Friday. But, yeah. [00:01:00]</p> Well, I had already decided that. I decided I want it. (pause) But that's fine. And then I had a chance to decide that I was okay with not Danng it before they called, (inaudible at 01:32).</p> Yeah, I kind of had, like, you know... But yeah, so. You know, it's (inaudible at 01:55) OK actually. And, you know, all in all. And, yeah, I'm so glad. (laughs) I feel like I've been trying to have a shorter commute for two years. And it's finally going to happen. (laughs). I'm really excited to move, not because of anything other than, like, I can walk and it'll take me 20 minutes to walk. And if I'm running late, I can take the train and it'll take me ten minutes. And you're already ten minutes late anyways, so it'll be fine. Really excited about that. [00:02:32]</p> So, I think I said—I think this was like a week or two ago—I was talking about Dan (sp?). And I was talking about him kind of rounding up, in terms of thinking that things are better than they are. And I can't believe—I thought I didn't do that. Like, part of me is like, I cannot believe that I said, ""Well, this is what Dan (sp?) does, this is not what I do."" (inaudible at 05:25) like, preoccupied a lot right now. Well, what else am I (inaudible at 05:30)? (laughs). The answer is, probably a whole lot. That's one of the things I've been thinking about. [00:05:44]</p> Yeah. Both in terms of, I have been a teacher—so I'm interpreting what you're doing from the perspective of, like, ""What would Chad do if he were a teacher?"" And I (pause)—I have a very—particularly since I taught—have a very clear idea of what my role is as a student in order for, like, things to work. So like, Professor Mills (sp?) has—I mean, I found this incredibly, incredibly irritating for, like, the first month and a half of taking his classes. And I got over it. He has to work things out in his own time. Like, he has a script and you have to let him follow the script. The problem is that your responses are part of the script, and so, you have to figure out what he wants you to say and then say it so that he can move on with his script. And for most teachers, this is a fucking disaster. Like, a lot of people do this, and most of the time, it just doesn't work at all. But it works for Mills (sp?) because he's a genius. And because if you just sit back and let him get where he wants to go, and let him get where he wants to go in the way that he wants to get there, the end result is something really fantastic. [00:09:37]</p> Trying (inaudible at 10:33). Sorry, when I don't see you for a really long time, I think a lot—as in there's like a lot of to—just, like, dumb. (laughs). So, yeah. But it's also—part of the problem for me is that (pause) I felt that a teacher knows a lot of things that they're not going to tell me right away, because the way that a course works, the way that education works, is step-by-step-by-step. And you can't jump. I mean, you can jump sometimes but it's usually better not to. [00:11:26]</p> In practice, really way less OK with it than I would like to be. (laughs). And it's hard to tell the difference between what I think and what I'm feeling, or what I'm—[00:12:29]</p> Well, if I knew then (laughs). Well, things like, I can't believe that I thought I didn't lie to myself. I'm sure that you never thought I wasn't capable of lying to myself. You know, that's not how people are.</p> Things like, I said—what, like the first day? I was like, ""I don't believe I'm being conscious. I think subconscious, I don't know."" You know, that you didn't take that off (ph) with me. Because you couldn't at that point, you can't. [00:13:25] </p> So I guess there's a question here somewhere of, like, what kinds of things are you really telling me and what kinds of things aren't you? But I don't think that's really a fair question to ask you, so (laughs). </p> God, Dan (sp?) used to do this. He's like, ""I'm not asking."" And then he would be like, ""But I imagine such and such."" And be like, ""You just asked. You can't say I'm not asking this, and then state what you want, and think that that's not a question."" (laughs). [00:14:40]</p> I hadn't thought to fit in those terms, but yes.</p> Oh, yeah because then I'd know exactly what to do. (laughs)</p> Well, that's not how I think about school, but yeah. You know more of the answers. (laughs). I mean, there's a reason my favorite subject was English, rather than math. Because I never felt (pause)—I never felt like my opinion wasn't as good as the teacher's. Just that, the teacher's a lot more experienced than I was, you know. All too often, I thought my opinion was better. Like, I hadn't really recanted my (inaudible at 16:46), so whatever.</p> Yeah. But, I mean, it's not that they know all the answers, but they know more than I do and they know how to approach the topic. I mean, I think this is part of the reason why this thing with Dan (sp?) has been so hard for me (pause) you know. And that I thought that relationship was safe—and then it wasn't. [00:17:52]</p> They have a place where I'm going—it's a good place to be. (laughs). Well, usually.</p> Yeah, (inaudible at 19:07). If you know all the answers, nobody yells at you. Did I tell you about fourth grade geography? Oh my god. I mean, I still am embarrassingly bad at geography. Like, I'm, like, truly embarrassed at how bad I am at it, but I just—I failed every single quiz in fourth grade geography. I would just get zero after zero after zero after zero, and the teacher was this, like, (laughs)—she was like, probably mid-forties at the time, like 5'10"", very tall, very thin, kind of a (inaudible at 20:07). I think—I heard later that she, like, kind of got around. We lived in a town with, like—like, the town was, like, 3,000 people, so, like, getting around you don't have to go very far. And she was terrifying. They called her ""Queen Beasley."" And, you know, the kids (inaudible at 20:28) fourth grade and so, it was like, this, like, ritualized ordeal of you spend the year with Mrs. Beasley, and before that, like, it's like baby school, and after that, you're a real student. [00:20:40]</p> Yeah. Which, in many ways, it was, because she was very, very good. Like, a very effective teacher. You learned a lot. But she wasn't the kind of teacher that was necessarily very good for me, because she was very degrading, and I was easily degraded. And I think it was this—I mean, when I think back about it, I think this is the strange situation where she could see that I was very, very smart, and I would failing everything. And she didn't understand why and the reason was very basic—I didn't know how to do homework, and nobody was making sure that I did it. [00:21:39]</p> I mean, you know, (laughs) more or less that way often. Sorry (ph), I'm still working on (inaudible at 23:46). But, like (pause) I actually forgot where I was telling the story. But it was awful. Like, I would just cry, and cry, and cry, and feel so stupid and so ashamed, and she would humiliate me in public, you know, in front of the other kids. And, you know, she was definitely a, like, you know—it was one of those hard-line, take-no-prisoners kind of high stakes approaches, and I think those are effective to some degree, but, like, they—you know, it was just really bad. (pause) And it's just that nobody noticed. So, I kind of continued in that vein (ph) until I hit high school, and then I learned that if you study, then people don't yell at you. Before that, I thought just people just yell at you. (inaudible at 24:56) yelled at me, and I couldn't quite figure out why's everybody yelling at me and not everybody else. [00:25:01]</p> Yeah, I didn't really learn how to study consistently, you know, to get the grades, until I got to high school. It's just something clicked. I think it was a combination of having, like, a study hall, you know, I was at boarding school, so we had very, very structured time. And having friends, I think. Just, like, feeling like I was somebody who could do this. Or I don't know. Like, I —</p> I still didn't want to.</p> And I didn't see the connection between the studying and people yelling at me. Like, (laughs), I don't know why but, like, I just didn't—it's like I didn't see a future in which I could get good grades. And so, I didn't see a future in which I could be valued for these things. I don't know why. But I just —</p> Yeah, and I, you know, I continued to do OK. Like, I got into St. Margaret's (sp?). I didn't get into St. Christopher's, which was the school where my sister went and where I really wanted to go. But, St. Margaret's (sp?) was probably better for me anyway. St. Christophers didn't really have any mechanism of dealing with kids who didn't—kids with any kind of—outside of the solemnly high-end of normal range. So, it was hard (inaudible at 27:11). It's just, like, severely ADHD and I just didn't know what to do with that. [00:27:18]</p> I think both. It was the same teacher for sixth and eighth grade.</p> Yeah, like, why did that keep happening? Or, I was, like, hopelessly disorganized. Like, I still am—I'm hopefully disorganized now. (laughs). You know, you'll give me a piece of paper and it would be gone. It was never coming back. And the main way that they communicated with parents was they would give us, you know, give us things to take home to our parents. I never took that (inaudible at 29:13) there, and my father is hopelessly disorganized—he never thought to ask about it. And so there's just, as far I remember, there's, like, miles of miscommunication. But I don't know. [00:29:27]</p> Well, he—I don't know. He would say, ""Okay, we're working on organization, you know, we're all working on organization. Tanya (sp?), you need to work on organization."" But then he'd be gone. (laughs)</p> He never did that.</p> No, he never did that. I think it didn't occur to him that that was something he should do. Like, I don't—I don't know why. [00:30:44]</p> But he didn't.</p> Yeah. Maybe he did and I just don't remember it. I mean, I think he would ask me whether I'd do my homework, or whether I had done my homework. And I would say, ""Yes."" And I wouldn't have. I think. Or I would say, ""I'm doing it,"" while I was, like, sitting at the table, staring into space, and after a while I would put it down and go do something else. But I'd not have it done. [00:31:34]</p> This is something I hadn't realized, but I kind of still, like—it's really hard. Like, it's hard for me to talk about. Also I just feel so ashamed and so upset with him. You know, why the fuck couldn't he do these things? Like, everybody does them, as you say. You know, I don't care that his job was hard. I don't care that he was working all the time. Like, I recognize that he was doing his best, but it wasn't good enough. But there's nothing I can do about that now. (laughs)</p> I mean, this is still, like, mystery in your mind about this?</p> To me, it seems, like, pretty straight forward. [00:33:18]</p> (inaudible at 33:23), you know. I think he's severely, severely depressed and (pause), you know, I think I was just one of the things that slipped his mind.</p> I mean, also that was the way he was raised. I know I'm just coming up with excuses for him, but that is in fact true. (laughs) [00:34:30]</p> But I do think that (pause). That —</p> (inaudible at 35:03).</p> Well, I've thought about it a lot. Took me a very, very long time to forgive him, you know. Well, know, like, maybe I should un-forgive him, because (inaudible at 35:25). (laughs)</p> He didn't really check my backpack. Nobody ever checked my anything. And I didn't know parents did that—like, I actually didn't. (laughs) Good to know. Parenting tip. (laughs)</p> Barely. (laughs). I mean, like, there was a lot of food in the house. There wasn't always food on our plates, unless we made it. We always had something to wear—we never had enough to wear. Like, you know, I wore pants that were, like, this short, because it didn't occur to me that I could ask for new clothes when I had outgrown the old ones. That kind of thing. But he was still doing better than his parents. [00:38:07]</p> Oh, fuck yeah. (laughs). Sorry. (laughs) </p> Yeah, I know.</p> I wasn't thinking in that way at all. I mean, I was thinking more of in the, you know, I constantly look for people—for teachers to be stable people in my life.</p> You got that. (laughs)</p> I mean, I don't—I don't think I was—I felt that I was trying to hide this. I guess, we had a conversation a while back about, like, you know, my dad yelling. I guess I tried to—I thought that all of this had kind of come across in that conversation. But apparently not. (laughs)</p> But I'm not embarrassed to talk about it at all. I don't feel like, you know, I don't know, (inaudible at 40:35).</p> (laughs) Again, with the continuity.</p> That may be a convincing argument. But I know I tell people about it. I don't—I don't know. [00:41:21]</p> I'm really pushing not to, aren't I? Or something. (laughs) I don't know why. [00:42:25]</p> I am certainly not going to tell you about the (inaudible at 43:09). (laughs). I don't know. I mean, the puzzle for me has always been that, like, ""Was this really bad, or wasn't it really bad? And do I count as somebody who was neglected, or who had a hard childhood? Like, do I count?"" You know, the way that we think about it and talk about it, there's like—there's just two categories, and I don't feel like I'm really in either. And so far, I mean that I want to say, ""Yes, this was really bad."" I don't make it sound like justification for why things are really hard right now, but I don't... [00:44:04]</p> Yeah, there's a reason that I don't believe in public humiliation of children. I think that's the worst thing you can do to them. Well, not the worst thing, but it's pretty bad. Sorry, I interrupted you. </p> Which is weird, because I also really want to have been, like, I want it to be there. Because then I have something to hang on to. But, I don't know. It does feel like what's actually there, I'm really not happy about it. (laughs) [00:45:13]</p> (laughs) I don't want to [extend the tissue at you] (ph), but I did not. (laughs) Thank you.</p>",0
1004687732.txt,"Obviously if you can't fit me in for a while that's okay—well it's not really okay, but we'll make it okay. (laughs)</p> Oh, my God. (laughs) That sounds like an insane day.</p> Okay. That was why I brought it up, to ask you to keep your eyes open and, knowing that you're pretty solidly booked up at those ends of the day, I'll just be aware of that when I'm looking for jobs.</p> I think I'll just look for something around here. [00:01:50]</p> Okay, thanks. We'll make it work.</p> Can we talk a little bit about what you mean when you say ""taking up emotional space""? It's one of the things that I thought I knew what you meant when you first said it and the first several times, and it seems you use it in categories that make me think I don't necessarily understand what you're talking about. It's not entirely clear to me, like what we were talking about yesterday of me being loyal to people and also anxious about them. But I can't remember exactly how anxious is related to not wanting to dump on people in my life. Does that make sense? [00:03:12]</p> Okay. [00:04:04]</p> It will either come up again or it's not important (chuckles)</p> That's basically what I was taking from it. James and I, when we were talking two nights ago, I think one of the things he is finding is that it's just exhausting to be my main source of support. Somehow over the summer he's kind of become one of my only sources of support in terms of when things go really bad, I call him. There are various things behind that. He has really asked me and has always pushed me to call other friends also, and that part of the conversation I just really didn't feel good about. I can't tell how much of that is me pushing back against taking up emotional space and how much of this is me feeling like—there is kind of a resentment for me at the end of it and I don't know how much that was justified. </p> Yeah, I know. It's not like ""justified"" has any value. (laughs) Do you know what I mean at all? I guess what I said after the conversation was, ""You know . . . "" and he was like, ""Are you okay?"" I was like, ""Well, yes, but less so than before we started talking about this. I kind of feel like a package that is heavy and that is being passed from one person to another."" That and it's hard for me not to have a filter with most people. It's hard for me to take up space. Then the next time they have to talk to me, I have to catch the mop or something. It's really good that I have all of these people who really care about me, but I feel like it's making all of my relationships into relationships that are really just centered around me. [00:07:29] It's very easy for me to talk about myself always, and then I talk about myself for five minutes and I'm like, ""This isn't a conversation. I don't like this."" But I don't know how to get out of it. I feel like they think I'm sort of fragile—which they think I'm sort of fragile because I am so fragile, to be clear. (laughs) But they are afraid, maybe, to talk about other things. I feel like the depression is everything that I am. That makes it harder when I talk to other people, and it seems to me like they think the depression is everything I am also. That's a lot clearer in my mind than it was before I started talking about this. Thanks. (laughs) [00:08:37]</p> I just keep thinking of that David Foster Wallace story and I just don't want to be that. She had this support system and there was a special elite core of members within the support system that she tells everything to and it just feels so . . . arrgh. It's beautiful. (laughs) Novels are hard for me. Actually, it's like art is hard for me. I go too far into it sometimes or I have to catch it at the right moments. I'm re-watching Buffy and I had to stop at Season 6 because Season 6 is too much. </p> That's the one where she comes back from the dead and, basically, she just wishes she wasn't alive the entire season, so the season is her reconciling herself to the fact that life is hard. I knew it was coming then, so I could stop. It's just easy, particularly for very good art, for me to get so far into the characters that I become emotionally overwhelmed and that will send me into a week of being miserable. (laughs) [00:10:47] That's why I reread things 20 times, because I know what's coming. It's still an emotional journey, but it's a comfortable one and one that I know what's going to happen. David Foster Wallace's Brief Interviews with Hideous Men was a book that was good for me to read, even though it did, I think, send me off into several days of mess because he's ultimately a really hopeful writer. He's talking about ""this is the way that people fail to connect"", but he's talking about it in order to connect, to say connection is possible. It's not an accident that he ends the story collection with one or two stories in which connection really happens. That's nice. But I think I might need to take a break before I read him and adjust, although I do still find his writing style to be [ ]. (inaudible at 00:12:23) (laughs) </p> He's a novelist and he drops out of college to finish his first novel. He's a break-away success; everybody loves him. They meet when he's 23 and she's five years or several years older. She wants to be an actress. They get and he has an affair, or series of affairs; it's unclear. And then they get divorced, or he leaves her. It's funny—I got to talk to the playwright. He came into Notre Dame and he said he felt like it was this very, very culturally specific work about being Jewish in New York and being in New York, especially. The man is Jewish and the woman is Catholic. One of the things I heard this time around was, ""Oh, well obviously she doesn't think they're going to get divorced. She's Catholic. That's not how marriage works for her."" [00:15:55] They just have very different ideas about when you leave and for her, you don't leave. I thought it was very funny that he would say, ""I don't understand why this has such appeal to an 18-year-old in rural Texas."" I was like, ""No,"" because it is universal even though there are a lot of the jokes I got over a period of ten years. So this time around I was listening to the song about the husband didn't envelop me a lot and it's different than it was for me, but there is also a lot of the same stuff. For him, he needs some kind of emotional independence from his wife. [00:17:05] I think the line is, ""All that I ask for is one little corner, one tiny room at the back of my heart. Tell her I found one, she sends out battalions to claim it and blow it apart."" That's not what it was for me at all. I guess this shame was something I had heard but never been on the same side as. Also, there is a plot point in which the husband, Jamie, has a whole long song in which, as his Christmas present, he gives Cathy, the wife, a watch and he says, ""Take your time. I am going to support you while you devote yourself to acting full time."" Like ""do this"". I was looking into it yesterday I was like, ""That was a terrible idea."" (laughs) That is something you did that kind of started it, because he's brilliant and he's an artist and he's successful. In some sense it's about a kind of independence of artistry and she's not being successful. She is really uncomfortable with that and she really doesn't want him to have to support her. And so it's like she's grateful, but to have to keep on being grateful as you continue to not get call-backs, is brutal. But I get defensive a lot. (laughs) James needs somebody to take care of and I need somebody to take care of me so we work out pretty well, but I need that independence also. [00:19:38]</p> More the latter. Yeah. I do need to feel like I'm somebody outside of him. It's way more of a problem for Cathy than it is for me. That's on her end what drives things. For me it's just kind of something in the back of my head and something I've talked with James about it also; but I've always known this is something in our relationship I need to watch out for. I need to not get sucked in too far to feeling like I'm completely dependent on him. [00:20:49] Right now it's a problem in that the things that he said, ""It's okay for you to lean on me in this way,"" even though I've said, ""This is going to be really hard on you. I don't think I should lean on you in this way."" He said, ""It's okay,"" and now it's really hard on him. Part of me is angry at him for not listening to me or . . . (chuckles)</p> Yeah, but more I feel bad for having believed him but recognize that it should be, ""Well, okay, I'll lean a little less now."" Like none of this is necessary, you know? Maybe. I don't know. (pause) [00:22:19] He didn't say anything, but it was one of those—he was silent for several minutes because he was getting his temper under control. We were on the phone. I had called him crying because I was freaking out about paying some bill and didn't know exactly if I had that much money in my account to pay it. He said, ""Okay. Get out your checkbook and we'll look at the checks and see if there are any missing. We'll account for all the checks that you've written and see if they haven't been cashed."" I said, ""I don't really have just one checkbook because I lose them, so I just have two or three floating around."" (laughs) That's something that never would have occurred to me to feel bad about, but he was [ ] (inaudible at 00:23:24) Seriously, dude? (laughs) I think he did the right thing in terms of managing his anger and, if he had yelled at me, that would have gone really badly. At the same time, I knew he was really angry, so it didn't go well. Especially financially, he does a lot of handling for me. I am really grateful for that but I also worry that it's going to be too much for him and that I shouldn't just tell me what I need. [00:24:36]</p> Yeah, but I also think that's a terrible idea in that that's where distance starts, I think. My dad is coming to town today. He hasn't told me about this. He's just been texting me. I don't have unlimited text. I have a lot and I usually don't go over, but I don't count them. (laughs) He sends me these long texts and I started to reply and I'm just like, ""I'm just going to call him."" I leave a message and he texts me back. He's like, ""It's too late to call,"" (laughs) and so I text him a reply and then he texts me back again. (laughs) I was a late convert to texting, in case you can't tell. (laughs)</p> It's like we'll make plans and then he'll suggest changing them. I'm like, ""Wow. Everything in your life is really subject to change in a way that's just not for me anymore."" There was one time, I was like fourteen and it was in summer, and he came home from church (we lived across the street from church) and he said, ""Okay. We're going to the city in a half-hour."" (laughs) I was like, ""What?"" [00:27:00] And he was like, ""I told you, right?"" And we were like, ""No. No you didn't."" (laughs) So we packed up and went to the city for the weekend, a couple of days, and visited friends and family. Oh my gosh. That is really crazy. I really like the stability of having plans as James does, but it doesn't come naturally. James is like, ""When is your dad visiting?"" (both laugh) I had told him, ""He's going to come on Wednesday and leave Thursday, probably before you get in, because he's getting in tomorrow really late."" And then yesterday my dad was like, ""I'll have a car, so I can help you move if you want—maybe even stay over until Friday to help you move."" That's my dad. (laughs) We call him poppa. I still do. The good thing about him is that—it might be more with me than with other people—but he's really, really good about recognizing that this is a busy week for me and saying, ""I just want to be with you. I'm going to come and I'll be in the coffee shop whenever you get out of your appointment. You do what you need to do. Don't worry about it. I'll find a parking spot. I'll just follow you around for a couple of days."" That's really nice. As far as I can tell, his entire theology is based around ""show up and be with people and be flexible""; and I think that's pretty good. [00:28:55] He's really good with people that are grieving, people in the hospital. He really gets that—just be there. He and James wear, not only the same size shoes, but the exact same kind of shoes. (laughs) It's a long-running, intermittent joke that I chose James because he's like my father and he chose me because I'm like his mother. I'm way more like his mother than he is like my father. [00:29:46]</p> They are, but they are also really similar in many ways. Some of the same kinds of [ ] (inaudible at 00:30:03) There was one time in college where I bought a pair of flip flops for myself and, at the same time, James's mom sent him the exact same pair of flip flops that she had bought for him. (both laugh) </p> I guess part of it is that my father's family lives all over the country and they don't necessarily spend that much time with each other, but there's just like an ""e-thought"" of loyalty. Basically in any city I go to I have a relative that I can spend the night with and just, ""S happy to see you. Always."" Then there are periodic [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:21)—usually at funerals, which is strange—where there are these huge and loud and [ ] (inaudible at 00:31:32) rapscallions (laughs), very idiosyncratic and probably pretty obnoxious to people outside. It's good to belong there, even though you don't. We're all alcoholics. (laughs) We're all kind of a mess. It's like we really are all in it together in some way. It's really important to me. James and I were talking about this last night. There is an episode of Buffy, I think it's called Family, in which Willow's girlfriend is not being accepted by the rest of the group and then her real family shows up. It's both because she's a lesbian and because she's a witch, clearly homosexuality equals magic, so they're trying to browbeat her into coming home. Buffy and everyone else is like, ""No, she's our family. Go the f**k away."" [00:33:14] We were talking about the fact that that loyalty is not that they like Tara. They don't dislike her, they ""nothing"" her, but because Willow loves her, she belongs to them. She's part of that. James was like, ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable thinking about that in terms of friends who are family than if they were actual family, because then what do I do with Vivienne's husband?"" Vivienne's husband is a huge asshole. (laughs)</p> Yes. I think I reconciled myself to that much faster than he did. I gave up on Brad much faster than he did. I don't know. I was kind of afraid to say, ""I think we do owe Brad that same loyalty."" Yes, we do. That's not incompatible with thinking that he's a huge jackass and saying, ""How dare you treat my sister that way?"" And saying, ""No, I will leave the room when you make racist and homophobic comments. That's not okay with me."" But he's ours. That's a good thing. It's one of the things I feel I'm lucky to have. [00:35:08]</p> Yeah. It's not there with my mom's family. They freeze each other. They're a whole other kind of f**ked up. (laughs) I guess I think of my dad's family as ""hot"" and my mom's family as very ""cold"", but my youngest aunt, Marla, has been . . . </p> Yeah, my mom's youngest sister, who is probably about seven or eight years younger than my mom. I kind of take her as a model of how not to let go of people in that, somehow, she has gotten to the point where she is married and has one child and they live a life of conspicuous consumption. I both really want it and I react against it also. I guess I do want a wine frig that has a separate temperature for white wine and red wine. (laughs) That's awesome. She sets boundaries, but she always reaches out. Every year she always invites everyone for Thanksgiving. My mom never goes. She goes once every six or seven years, and it usually ends badly. Everyone is really awkward. Everyone thinks they're having a good time but nobody is actually having a good time. Sometimes there is a really awkward, hushed silent beat, but she just keeps reaching out when she can, even though about a year after my grandfather died she got into a fight with my grandmother. I don't remember what she said to set it off, but my grandmother just erupted into this paroxysm of rage in which she basically said, ""I am mourning your father and you are not."" Marla was just like, ""No. Get out of the car."" (laughs) I think she just took her home and was like, ""Okay, we're done for now. I'll let you know when I'm ready to talk again."" But she just keeps going back to that. She just keeps trying. She just keeps being open. I want to do that. I don't know how to. [00:38:43] </p> She is like, ""Dude. I'm the one who is getting treatment."" (laughs) This is not a reflection of reality. I don't know how to evaluate that. In some ways I feel like Marla had to get out when she was really young and build a person and a life for herself early. I think in some ways she is less damaged than us; or more healed. She had cancer and almost died as a teenager. She was at boarding school and was in the hospital near the boarding school and her parents never visited her ever. [00:40:14]</p> Yeah. So then fast forward 30 years and she's having surgery on both her feet—she's a long-distance runner. I don't understand how it works at all. There's something like she might have to have her feet amputated and so she's having the surgery to get her back to running. It was really hard and a big deal and mom never called or visited her or did anything. Marla's like, ""Okay. We're not okay. This is a problem."" (laughs) I don't know how she does it; and it's not like she's perfect at doing it, but she keeps doing it. Every year she e-mails me and Amanda and Jason and says, ""Hey, if you guys are around, I'd love to have you over for Thanksgiving."" That's not that unusual in that there is no conflict there.</p> Yeah. How are we for time?</p> I thought a lot in teens and early twenties about just cutting off my mom and just being like, ""There is nothing. I have to not see you or talk to you."" I don't want that. I don't know how much of it is the kind of guilt that I recognize as not actually good and how much of it is ""that is not what I think family means"". I don't know how I will ever be able think about my mom and not have that stab of feeling guilty. Every time she crosses my mind I'm like, ""I should do this better,"" or ""I am failing her,"" except for when I'm actually around her. Then it's both ""I should do this better"" and ""I am so angry at her."" (laughs) </p> And it's felt about the same way about this for about the last 15 years, so it's sort of okay. (laughs) No, it's not really okay. </p> It's something I'm used to bearing.</p> Yeah. You're right. There is nothing I can do that will make me less vulnerable. Even if I cut off contact with her for the rest of our lives, I would still be that vulnerable to her. Thank you.</p> So what I can do is choose what that looks like, if that makes sense. Say, ""I am vulnerable to her, so I would rather be vulnerable in a way that I feel what I value."" Eh? (laughs) You look very skeptical. [00:46:48]</p> Kind of. I'm not very good at sitting with things that are bad, but yeah.</p>",1
1004824655.txt,"So, (pause), (sigh), (pause), (sniff), (pause), so I was thinking about our conversation quite a bit over the last few days and, (sniff), (pause), I don't know. A couple of things, I think came to mind. [00:01:33]</p> (Pause), and I also felt like you were kind of tacking in our, (pause), you were trying out a new tack and you were not owning up to it. It was kind of a—</p> That's the way it seemed to me, so I'm not quite sure what to make of that. And as I said as we were, (pause), going over coming to a close on Friday, (pause), some of that sense is probably external to you.</p> (Pause), those thoughts aren't enough apparently. (Pause).</p> What's that?</p> I guess something else could come to mind if I tried. But (pause), (sigh), (pause), what else comes to your mind? (Sigh), I mean you say, you said that you felt that I'd been more confrontational. Or I can't remember exactly how you put it. That wasn't it. [00:05:50]</p> (Pause), I mean they're kind of basically two—if we just sort of take the process of not getting work done.</p> Which is the nominal reason why I've come to you.</p> There are kind of two ways of looking at it. One is that there are all of these alternative, time wasting activities that, (pause), have their own kind of valence that are preventing it.</p> Yeah.</p> Exactly, so that was more simply put, all right? So (pause), I don't know what the—I mean I don't know that one has to choose between them necessarily except that, (pause), the—if there's a kind of graph. If you're graphing sort of responsibility versus, (pause), what's the other axis sound like—responsibility versus compulsiveness, compulsion—</p> Yeah. [00:08:26]</p> Yeah.</p> Exactly, exactly, exactly. And they're not—when I say—the metaphor of the graph, I think is a reasonable one, or the kind of conceptual model of a graph is a good one, because at different moments, proportion—</p> The kind of proportions could be different. The curve could look different, but (pause), all right, I guess that's it. I guess that's what's really—has been kind of maddening about the usual party line with respect to these things, which is that there's no, (pause), that it's all about being oppositional, that it's almost sort of a developmental, a failure of development. </p> No I don't think that, I don't, I don't. The responsibility mantra is charged for me and I don't—I feel, ironically I guess, resistant to it, (pause). I feel like it's a way of blaming me.</p> Now, that's probably not the best way of setting things up, in the sense that, (pause), well each of them has a trap imbedded in it. Each axis has a trap imbedded in it. On the one hand, (pause), there's no responsibility and then what are you going to do? You need a completely instrumental solution.</p> On the other hand if, (pause), you except full, complete, kind of totalizing responsibility then it's pretty potentially kind of devastating if you can't move, so you're kind of stuck, which frankly, I think is kind of where I have been for quite a while. So neither, (pause), neither a horizontal like or a vertical line is necessarily the best model, (sniff). (Pause), at least the most constructive model of whatever the issue may be. [00:12:17]</p> What you're talking about I think. What do you mean, what do I envision? (Pause), (sigh), (pause), (sniff), (pause), (sniff).</p> Yeah. Oh, you mean a model of causation? I think that the—[00:15:06]</p> Causation is the same. I mean, (pause)—</p> It's the same thing. It's the same phenomenon.</p> They're not, I mean that's why I describe it as a curve, really. It's not—</p> No.</p> No, no.</p> I mean not so much the being devalued as an absolute, more just sort of being, (pause), rendered helpless, (pause), being rendered without agency. I mean maybe it amounts to the same thing. It's just who's the actor in any given situation? But yeah, no, it's exactly the same. The—[00:16:05]</p> It's not two cases. I guess that's what I'm trying to say with this kind of [inaudible at 00:16:19]</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> I mean the response is the same. I mean we're trying to—I mean I guess what I'm trying to kind of evoke or find some way of visualizing is, (pause), it's more kind of a constant phenomenon, like what aspect of particleness (ph) is there and what aspect of waveness (ph) is there. </p> I see.</p> I see.</p> No, (pause).</p> Yeah, I mean I guess what I'm saying is the behaviors have a center, I don't know, a specific gravity of their own at this point. They have valence and (pause), you know they're compulsive. And they assert themselves sometimes even before there's a specific sense of upset.</p> I'm not worried about the why I'd be doing these particular things. I think it's probably whatever, but (pause), they can assert themselves. It feels to me as if in some instances, they can assert themselves without, (pause), necessarily being provoked by some specific kind of cognition or some specific kind of, (pause) anxiety.</p> It has to be dealt with.</p> I don't know if spontaneously, I'm just (sigh), (pause), again it's a curve with two axes [inaudible at 00:23:19]</p> (Sniffs), (pause), (sigh).</p> (Sniffs)</p> Well look, I mean what I think what I'm—you asked what came to mind and I'm telling you, what I'm reflecting back at you, or maybe that's not the right way of putting it. What I'm sort of expressing to you is what I feel or think when I hear what it seemed to me you were saying, or you did say overtly on Friday about responsibility.</p> Yes, so (pause), I believe that sometimes I assume, very consciously, and sometimes, just sort of intuitively,—you sometimes bring these things up in a way that's provocative. Maybe it's completely intuitive. Okay fine. So—</p> Yeah.</p> Okay.</p> Okay. (Pause), then it's not a misunderstanding.</p> Then my reaction would be to point out an honest misunderstanding. I mean on the other hand there were three things—for some reason I have near total recall of almost our entire conversation—</p> On Friday. It's interesting what—</p> It's interesting given what the conversation was, but —</p> What we've been talking about, in particular what we were talking about on Friday.</p> So on the one hand, (pause), I do feel this resistance, and I think I was giving voice to it on Friday as well, in maybe a little less worked out form. On the other hand, it is kind of notable that A. I felt this very strong sense of well-being—</p> Suddenly during the course of our conversation—</p> As soon as I felt that opposition sort of assert itself between us—</p> And B. that I apparently walked in, (pause), to this room, kind of feeling, (pause), feeling, in a sense that you were in opposition already, even before we'd said anything.</p> And they're not exclusive.</p> That's a problem.</p> (Chuckles), [I would say] (ph), you made me feel terrible.</p> (Chuckles), all right. (pause), (sigh), I mean I think I've always held out hope. And I could bring in abortive journals, very abortive journals from—</p> The age of eleven onward.</p> That give voice to this just sort of wish or hope. I've always just sort of had this fantasy that there would be some instrumental solution to my difficulty organizing myself and essentially to the behaviors that would intervene in what I thought was what I wanted to do—</p> Whether it was run every day, or do work, or write, or read, the things that I thought I should be doing.</p> Well just there would be something, there would be some sort of silver bullet, some magic bullet. On the other hand, I've always felt a very strong, sort of countervailing fantasy that it was really my fault, that if only I just sort of, (pause), willed it into being this would happen of its own accord.</p> And that historically, has not felt very useful either.</p> I know. We were talking about this on Friday, that's not really the way that you think about it. And I think that's fine. I mean I understand that. I accept it, and I get what the objective is, and I'm not rejecting it. I'm just saying that that's the way that it feels. [00:34:13]</p> You've said that before. I'm not sure that's true. What cards are we missing?</p> What cards are we still missing even after all this time?</p> You don't?</p> I'm not sure what manner of information you're looking for. (Pause), are you looking for a historical explanation?</p> Or is it—</p> Okay.</p> Why I had this strong reaction?</p> Well we've talked about this. I'm sure we've talked about this.</p> So you want to talk about it again? Okay.</p> I mean the one way of answering that question is just to kind of catalog historical events as to this dynamic.</p> I don't know, because Obama won the election.</p> I came into the, (pause), today's meeting feeling okay. I don't know. I mean I'm in a—</p> Relatively good mood. No. No. It's not like I'm less annoyed about this.</p> Oh, you're saying because I'm annoyed.</p> (Chuckles), I feel like I'm in a good mood right now.</p> When I came in I said I'm mad.</p> Yeah, that's true, that's true. (Pause), well I mean I guess what I'm trying to say though is that I had some sort of baseline clarity that allowed me think through what I was feeling in a way that is difficult when I'm feeling really distressed. (Pause), that this is my proposition. </p> I just kind of identify it. I don't know, it's a good—I'm not rejecting—</p> I'm not rejecting the question. I agree that it's interesting.</p> I'm not saying no, (chuckles).</p> I'm not saying no 15 times and—</p> Whatever. No I am not—</p> (Chuckles), all right, down the rabbit hole, so I mean, I'm not though. I agree it's interesting. [00:38:38]</p> I agree it's curious. I agree my selective memory is—it's troublesome. It's strange. It's, (pause)—</p> We don't understand. (Pause), okay, (pause).</p> What's the difference between the explanation and the comment (ph)?</p> Yeah, (pause).</p> I mean—</p> Yeah, that's partly (ph) fine. I mean and that's my natural inclination is to say exactly that. Why is it so mysterious? I mean what are you looking for beyond that? (Pause), why does there need to be an explanation that's more, (pause), sophisticated than that, (pause)? (Sigh), using sophisticated as a majorative (ph) here.</p> Well I wouldn't be—I mean I wouldn't be here given—</p> The way that we do business—</p> If I didn't think that in some sense there was, (pause), there was something about change, that was possible in a way—</p> That would not be an option—</p> If I was—</p> Black.</p> Well, (pause), (sigh), what does it complicate? I'm not being argumentative.</p> That's just an honest question.</p> It's a little more ambiguous.</p> (Pause), in some sense, I believe it.</p> It's part of the picture.</p> Yeah, okay. (Pause), okay?</p> Yes. (Sigh), all right, see you on Friday.</p>",2
1000013364.txt,"Now I was a little troubled by the clock, can we-is it possible to put it in a place where we can both see it or is that - ?</p> Yeah okay, and the session is basically 50 minutes?</p> Okay, so it almost seems like we just kind of get into something and then it just-time runs out. Yeah let me talk about a few things and I had one observation, I was filling out the forms, I was thinking about some of last week's session and I notice when we got into-I mean it's a couple of weeks in a row, we got into issues, we're going down one path and then we come back or your questioning comes back to feelings about my mother and it was a little, to me I guess it was a little disappointing. Because, I don't know, I think I could spend all my life talking about my mother, I kind of would like to put all the issues about my mother aside.</p> I mean do you think it's productive to deal with my-is it-I mean you raised the question, I just don't know whether it's produc-I just-</p> No I don't-yeah I agree, I don't think it's productive. I think she's just too, you know, there's not much I can do to change our relationship between me and my mother. I've tried and-so I don't know that it could be productive so I'd just as soon-</p> Yeah definitely not.</p> Yeah I'd kind of like to put it aside for the time being. I've kind of just made my peace with the fact that, as you say, she's not going to change, I think I'm kind of stable or I've kind of made my peace with myself. That I do as much as I can but that I can't drive myself crazy about dealing with her and talking to her too much. I mean that's just-so I just kind of want to go on and I'm thinking that that's probably why what I really want to do is spend more time with bright interesting women because I just-I suffered so much under-in my relationship with her, with her mother. With my first wife, I had-in those three cases, three very, very kooky weird manic narcissistic difficult women.</p> No, no I think last week I was a little upset at the-after that session because I was getting into what I thought was some interesting stuff and then we kind of got-I got sidelined on the business about my mother. But other than that, no I'm still so incredibly pleased with the way my mood is so much better, more optimistic and upbeat and hopeful even. That if these same circumstances, the trouble on the deals, the trouble-the little bit of trouble in the relationship with Jemma had come about before our therapy had started, and then again, the wild cards, the Paxil as well.</p> Well she's picking up on how-it's been this issue of my relationship with Skyler that is always a little bit unclear to me and Jemma, very quickly, very smartly picks up that I feel very, very, very close to Skyler, primarily because of the fact that she's Madison's mother and the only person taking care of Madison. And so I just am enormously beholden to her and appreciative of her parenting efforts and she's done a wonderful job and I'm just, for the most part, very, very pleased with Madison's development. [00:15:20 ]</p> Well I don't know that I necessarily want to separate it. I'm not sure that it needs to be separated but Jemma is-has suggested that I kind of draw some-for example, here's an example as to how she sort of happened to mention to her that one of the time-one of the thousands of little bits and pieces of fallout from Skyler checking into the detox, is the fact that I had just agreed to pay for a ticket. I just bought her a ticket to go down to Miami [inaudible] [00:17:04 ] next week and take the whole [inaudible] [00:17:08 ] for her board certification as a physical therapist. She had passed the written, flunked-</p> And that's Jemma's question. Why am I paying for the ticket?</p> We have no formal arrangement. I mean we go on all these many years now, five years without anything, any definitive arrangement. It's been very loose and it has-</p> Yeah, we just never-we talk from time to time about writing something down, I guess partly because my income has been so uncertain and she's worked and not worked and it's been-it's been very difficult and I know it's something we at one point, a couple of the-last year started to think about getting a mediator or a facilitator and helping us come to a more definitive-</p> There really hasn't been, it's been kind of very-</p> Well, we kind of wanted to get some guidance to kind of clarify many things about the parenting issues and just nothing has been defined. From everything from the name Madison uses which at the minute is her mother's name to all kinds of decisions, decision making, all kinds of financial business.</p> Jemma is not saying she's jealous, but she's-</p> No, she's raising some legitimate issues which is when I do things, when I write checks to Skyler, which I just do on kind of an ad hoc basis. Some years it's been a lot, as much as $18,000, $25,000 and some years it's been very little, as little as $6,000. The question in her mind is theoretically everything could be traced back to Madison, to the extent that I'm writing a check for Skyler that frees up money that she can-that she was otherwise going to spend [inaudible] [00:19:43 ], it's just fungible balance.</p> I respect Jemma and I-we've achieved I think, such a wonderful relationship that I am happy to have her input on every aspect of my life and I'm glad that she's raising it because I think she's-I don't feel defensive about it. I think it's about-</p> She says she is and I can accept that there might be at some point a conflict but not yet, nothing at this point. But anyhow, that's one place where on money issues, we're not doing things for Skyler, we're doing it for Skyler, has Skyler doing it for Skyler as Madison's mother.</p> Yeah, taking their lead, yeah.</p> I don't think I what?</p> When you-when my mother?</p> Well you're right but in a way I guess, I'm glad that you did because then it just kind of-it may have forced me to deal with and I'm glad I did. I took a more assertive stand and I thought about it and I said-and I considered it. Is there any benefit in talking about my mother? And so I'm glad that it came up and that we dealt with it and I appreciated your feedback on it, that it's-that we don't necessarily have to deal with it but that it might come in at some other way into our work.</p> I think I was upset last time and okay, but life has its upsetting moments but I think the place-I think that where I'm growing and enjoying life more and enjoying the interactions that I'm having with you and I think this is helping me get somewhere is that I can be upset with a woman without it becoming a big deal.</p> That was-yes, that could that, that led to that, exactly. Something that allows me to engage with women, to listen very hard to what they have to say and try to-maybe try to help solve problems that are on their mind. Also learn and grow from my interactions with them and just have some very, very good intensive communications about real life issues, of personal growth and fun and pleasure and dating and romance and all the things that I think-that I enjoy and I think most people enjoy. And I guess and I'm hearing more and more so many guys like me don't particularly-either aren't good at talking about or don't particularly want to talk about.</p> Yeah, yeah.</p> Yeah I mean it's certainly in the fantasy. But-</p> I had a big reaction when you started-</p> I thought the rest of your-I imagined the rest of your sentence was going to be in your fantasy about fixing women up, like I guess I projected you, I thought you were going to say to me, maybe you're thinking about even fixing me up.</p> Yeah. I knew it was going to come to something fairly personal and sensitive and-</p> No.</p> I mean I just-</p> It just kind of just jumped into my mind. I didn't-well I saw that you were headed in some provocative direction, I guess that was the first thing that occurred to me. But the whole business about being a friend and a sensitive communicator with women and not-but doing it in a purely platonic way is something-that's my main objective and I'm not looking to-I don't-I want to be-it would be gratifying enough to me to just to be involved and having these wonderfully stimulating connections. And not involved in the physical way, particularly if my relationship with Jemma continues to be-evolves in the direction that I want it to go which is-that we'll be a couple and committed to each other, then I would see that as essentially monogamous. [00:32:50 ]</p> No.</p> Well the more important thing is-or the business about, I mean I knew that one of the objectives of the research was to kind of-was to-I could see that the forms test or ask me questions about how I'm feeling, about the relationship with my therapist and how I'm projecting what the therapist is feeling about me. So it's not something that-so I'm aware of that when I fill out the forms at the end of the session. I'm trying to be as honest and helpful to the people who are conducting the research as possible. [00:37:14 ]</p> Yeah because-to involve trying to be-'cause I guess that's the difference. I'm trying to be honest and at the same time, understanding that in my honesty, I may not be winning any friends here. I may be exposing myself as-in a way that you might perceive as a shallow jerk or that an intelligent woman might perceive as a shallow jerk. But at the same time, it's not my objective here to necessarily win friends, it's to kind of try to get my issues out on the table and for us together to examine them.</p> No because I think what I just said is actually the reverse. That I'm prepared to be as authentic as I-to be perfectly authentic and open and say things that, reflecting on them, might make me look like a jerk to you. Might turn you off that way. I think I'm saying that, that I'm not censoring myself. I'm not here to win a popularity contest, I'm not here to have you necessarily like me or respect me which I would normally be in my relations with women because as I've said, so much of my life is about winning the approval of women.</p> Okay, well we might-'cause I mean my question was even more to the point of in talking about this desire to befriend women and to engage with women and connect with them, the fact that led that you asked is this a ploy to end up-you didn't use the word ploy, but I guess it crossed your mind. Is this-would this possibly lead to your sleeping with them? I guess causes me to suspect that you kind of reacted to that somewhat negatively or basically jumped to the-you so quickly jumped to the conclusion that I might be using that as a way and I guess maybe what I'm saying is maybe, this maybe betrayed a feeling about me as the kind of guy that would do that. Which leads me to wonder, are you-</p> Well the very fact that you asked me made me wonder are you disapproving-would you disapprove of that? Or does it lower your regard for me so that it hinders our working relationship? [00:43:29 ]</p> Well I guess my concern is that if you don't approve of me, it's not-you're saying, I honestly believe you that it's not an impediment to working with me, but I know that in my work, I do a better job for people that I-my clients that I like. And to the extent that you, quote, unquote, don't like me or don't approve of me, it might cause you to be less enthusiastic about our working together.</p> Yeah, or disrespecting me or just seeing me as a jerk. 'Cause I know-that's a-there's like a huge divide between-in the lines of the women that I know between jerks and non jerks and it's very important for me to not be a jerk 'cause that's what I keep hearing from women. And I think for much of my life I was a jerk and I've been trying so damned hard to stop being a jerk. To being a mensch, to being somebody that a woman can really befriend. And it's important to me to have a woman say to me that, ""You're not a jerk Aidan,"" 'cause there are so goddamned many jerks out there. [00:46:59 ]</p> I mean I'd like to [inaudible] [00:48:23 ] for one more minute. 'Cause I think we're right at something very interesting. Does that make sense to you?</p> Yeah, both.</p> All right, well that's-I think I may feel like that's really a-that's really I think at the heart of a lot of what's at the essence of a lot of my issues I think. I mean it could even make sense to pursue that in the next session?</p> Okay, so you don't have a clear cut answer on that.</p> All right, I guess I'm-and I guess the last thing and I know you've had this [inaudible] [00:49:31 ] to, if I were to ask you whether I came across as a jerk or a mensch [ph], I guess it would be premature. I guess you'd have to reserve judgment probably on it.</p> Okay, good thanks. Do you have a pen? Can I just ask one last question? Do you-how would you like me to refer to you as? As Julie or Dr. Larsen or [inaudible] [00:50:10 ]?</p> Do you have a preference?</p> Great.</p> Thank you.</p>",1
1000013370.txt,"Well. I must say, I'm going to need your help a little bit in this session because I'm a, I'm feeling a little nervous because, you know, it is toward the end.</p> What, the second to last session?</p> You know, and I'm, it's like, I'm not sure what my expectations were but I mean I couldn't have possibly expected to change my whole life. Which is too damn well settled. So in some sense I mean I'm disappointed. I'm not a dramatically different person than when I came here.</p> At the same time, you know I'm in a pretty good place. With a lot more perspective I would say. And a lot more of a sense of kind of looking (inaudible at 0:01:09.2) or felt awarenesses of what's going on. So it's like there's nothing, you know, I mean how much, it's kind of hard for me to figure out a way to be productive and meaningful and prepared to bring out (inaudible at 0:01:29.4) so it's having a little bit-</p> Yeah. Exactly. I mean there's vastly more to do in terms of where to go with it in my life. But my past issues, my father just called last night to tell me he was getting, he had to cancel what I had looked forward to. A very sentimental weekend. Him and my mother going up to Ithaca to see my son for a visiting weekend. He just feels too frail. To go. So it's the first time that something like this has happened. [0:02:12.6]</p> Yeah. And yet, and yet, in a weird way it's like nothing is working optimally. And none of these issues are anywhere close to being solved. Or do I feel like, you know, I have a real good handle on them? And yet in some, some perverse way I keep, as the office keeps going, I keep managing one way or the other to get the work out. My life just keeps kind of rolling along and so it's like -  there's a part of me just says, part of me fears that at some point this is all going to explode into some kind of mini crisis. [0:04:18.5]</p> I think I might. I think I might. I think it has, I think it's a good, it's not a bad idea. There's a certain I guess security in knowing that it has a beginning, a middle and then dealing with the end. And maybe kind of -</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> You know -</p> Yes.</p> Yes.</p> Because it's kind of out of my control. And what I'm thinking is that sometimes it's kind of a relief. To have things out of my control. To know to that it's not up to me to make a judgment as to when I've had enough therapy. Or haven't had enough therapy. So. [0:10:00.9]</p> Because I'm lacking in the sense that, as I said, I think it ties into this feeling of there's -  I feel like when I'm working in therapy that the potential I think, that the possibilities of making dramatic life changes are so kind of, are out there for me. So there's maybe a temptation for me to take rash steps to try to do maybe too much. On the idea that I've got this nice package term, either I'm going to take a preset amount of time and do one of two things. Either smooth out some of the wrinkles in my current life which is essentially what I feel I've accomplished in our time together. I'm much less apoplectic. I'm much less sad, depressed. Less thrown by dealing with women.</p> Yeah. Because -</p> Yeah. In the sense it's like my relationship, I think it would be like my relationship with Jemma, my relationship in my work. It's so damn hard because I have the continuing sense, as in so much of my life, this kind of is the cup half full or is it half empty. Is my work in therapy really doing, am I really reaching for the sky and doing far reaching things? Because I have this opportunity now to have some intelligent, lovely person kind of listen to me and help me struggle through all these things to make these changes. So am I doing, could I be doing better? Could I have a different therapist? I guess  -</p> Should I have a different therapist, or be in a different mode of therapy. I think I'd just be constantly vacillating. Should I be in five day weeks? I'd want analysis. It would be just a constant turmoil in my mind. And so this is a certain freedom from having to worry about that. I've made a commitment to this particular program, to this particular therapist, to this particular relationship. And I don't have to think hard till the end of the therapy what I'm going to do next.</p> I don't have to work that out. It just, it's just one critical judgment that I don't have to have in my mind. I don't have to think about. About the consequences of continuing doing something that I could be doing more often or less often or with somebody different or in a different mode. And it's just something I don't have to think about. And because I'm not, I guess I'm just a little insecure about the, you know, some big decisions I've made. And managing important relationships. You know, it'll be another relationship to manage. I think that may be it. I don't have to manage the relationship with Julie. It's just - -</p> Yeah, it's been predetermined. You know, I'm going to come and the relationship between Aidan and Julie is going -</p> I think if it's as a consumer of professional services, if I were engaging an attorney -  I think I told you that in my divorce litigation I had a female attorney that I kind of fell in love with. And I mismanaged that relationship terribly. In terms of how I related to her and how we handled we handled the custody litigation and all of that. Because of the inappropriate feelings that I had for her that could lead to romance. Which it ultimately did. [0:16:16.3]</p> Possibly. But -</p> It's possible. I just know I've had a lot of bad judgments in handling those relationships. And it just adds a degree of tension I think that I'm hoping to, that's been kind of I think in some ways good for me again not to have it in front. Not to have to deal with it in some ways. So I think it also, there's also a trust factor too. I know that in these relationships between providers of professional services, lawyers, therapists, all kinds of other doctors, bankers, and consumers, there is an innate conflict of interest. That I see myself as a provider of those services. And I -</p> Well I'd be afraid I'd be exploited.</p> Yes.</p> Those are the things. Exactly.</p> Right. There's that. I mean you've hit it very well. Because like in the relationship with Jemma for example, we went on this very expensive trip to Peru. I just took her the night that I missed the, that we had the misunderstanding about the session. I'd just come back from Peru. Five days, six days in Peru. Cost me a lot of money. And boy, I laid out the lion's share. She made kind of half hearted attempts to pay. And I kind of was then in the uncomfortable position of not really wanting to take her money but not really feeling that I could spend the money on my own. So I kind of felt a little bit exploited. But then you know it was offset by a real genuine sense that Jemma really is not in this relationship just for whatever dinners I can take her to or vacations I can take her on. That she genuinely cares about me and genuinely appreciates the non tangible aspects of the relationship.</p> Very frightening. Exactly. And I think it's been as I think about it the reason that it's been very hard for me to have long term therapy in the past because I can never quite know when what the therapist is proposing is as much in the therapist's interests as it is in mine.</p> And it's kind of hard to know that.</p> And since it, very much of my life I'm just totally struggling, trying to minimize that.</p> I haven't quite figured out the tools. I suspect it could be. But I don't know that I'm really well trained in knowing how to sort that out. I mean I know that these are issues that could be sorted out.</p> Yeah. It's kind of hard.</p> Right. Could be. I guess it's possible. And maybe it's a big issue for me. Maybe larger than I realized. How to really take care of what's important to me and protecting myself against the fear of exploitation. But doing it in the face of, and what I used before with you as kind of gracious way, a way that's tactful, that doesn't seem to [snibble] (ph) in there, to- [0:24:21.6]</p> Right.</p> Right.</p> Right. It is. I guess it all goes to show that in some ways I'm happier maybe to not look under the carpet. Not really know what dark truths are under there. And to kind of live, in a little bit of a fantasy land. But it's kind of a lack of the just knowing quite how to do it. In a way that doesn't make, doesn't turn off the other person. The person I'm trying to manage the relationship with. By asking the hard questions in a way that gets them to understand where I'm coming from and be empathetic to me. I just am now recognizing how, what an incredibly valuable skill that would be. (inaudible) [0:26:13.6]</p> Yes. Yes. I am, you know, because I, and again, it's something else that I said earlier. It comes back to being that a lot of, by kind of maintaining this sort of nice guy posture, this sensibility of somebody who's not being too prickly, too demanding, too antagonistic, or confrontational. In some ways it's allowed, by putting off these confrontations, it's kept me, it's kept a lot of relationships alive with me. That might otherwise have really foundered, that I might have really torpedoed.</p> Yeah. That's what I mean. Yeah. If I, what I'm saying here, is if there had been a subject that would have, you know, led to a -  we had a little bit of a confrontation at the end of this session a couple of weeks ago.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. It could've been more. And you know, so it, I guess the lesson is now, again the fact that we have this predetermined 30 week session may have mitigated a little bit the, I mean where you're kind of forced to continue to -</p> Could've been.</p> Could've been. Could've been. Both of us coming to a conclusion that it was just too much of a clash or something like that.</p> Yeah.</p> Well maybe I might've come to the conclusion. Maybe you might've come to the conclusion. You might've come to the conclusion that says you know, you're just too frustrating for me to work with. Because just as you kind of in a way were saying, I just have said as much as I'm prepared to say to keep asking you the same thing and we're not getting anywhere. At the end of that session you might've conceivably have said something similar at the next session. [0:30:12.5]</p> I'm not sure either. In a way I think too by shying away from or avoiding these confrontations I've, not only have I avoided directly antagonizing, aggravating, saying something maybe tactless or heedless to somebody else, but then I've been immune from their criticism back to me. So it could have led then to Julie saying to Aidan, ""Well you know you're a complete idiot or whatever. I just feel I'm wasting my time. You're wasting your money here. So.""</p> Could've been.</p> Could've been. [0:32:06.6]</p> I don't know.</p> I'm not sure either. What I might've done was, and what I'm always tempted to do in my life, is to say let's have a temporary break. Let's, you know what I should probably be doing at work, and maybe what I should be doing with Jemma, and potentially in therapy, is to say, all right, now we've come to a, you know, kind of a nasty confrontation that's making me feel uncomfortable. And I imagine making you feel uncomfortable. Let's go to our separate worlds for X number of days or weeks or whatever. See how it feels to be out of each other's lives for awhile.</p> I think where I get myself into trouble is that maybe I'm not as quick and nimble a responder. So in the heat of the moment, I typically am disappointed. I don't have the right response. The right thing to say to kind of get across my real sense of what I want to say to you about where we are in that moment. [0:34:21.9]</p> As if what?</p> There's that.</p> Yeah by saying something that -</p> Yeah.</p> And I'm just honestly, as I think about it, I'm unpracticed. At the art of fighting. And I'm unpracticed at the at, and having not particularly good experiences about having major problems with women in my workplace.</p> Well -</p> Yeah.</p> Well, I summed it up, I think I may have summed it up. And just saying it left me in a lot of different ways. Because there's a part of me that very is loathe to want to fight with a woman. Because there's a lot of me that kind of puts bright, attractive women -  I mean a lot of me puts you kind of on a pedestal. [0:36:20.9]</p> On the other hand though, there's this sense of since I'm being deprived of what I want from all the women in the world, to have, to cuddle with them and what not. So it's then I'm worried that maybe my emotions will get the better of me and I'll be more antagonistic. As a chance to kind of strike back at not getting what I want. So.</p> Well I'm sure there is. I'm sure there is. And it's because I'm, and that's why I try to, that's why again, so many mixed, conflicted feelings towards women.</p> It's so hard. So it's better to just kind of -</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah. And -</p> Yeah. Exactly. So I shudder to ask the question and -  no I mean that is what it is. Is there - Anything that occurs to you that I should do with that?</p> Yeah.</p> Where they come from. You mean like early childhood stuff and the mixed, the kind of the whole mixed feelings towards my parents?</p> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, yeah. It's -</p> Right.</p> Yes.</p> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p> Yeah. So I have that. I appreciate the way you put that. I have that awareness. I'm just more and more trying to focus on having these awarenesses.</p> And as I said last time, or a couple weeks ago, about now as I sit with you, the awarenesses, I'm hoping that out of that -</p> Yeah. Yeah.</p> Well I kind of liked the way that you nicely summed all that up. And it was helpful. It was nice. Nice way that you tied up some of these loose ends. It was good for me to leave, to have a, to leave here tonight with a, I always like to kind of have a sense after each of our sessions as to what the kind of take home message is. And at the same time, as I said at the very beginning, the vast work of kind of coming to grips with these love/hate relations toward my mother, toward so many of the women that I deal with, is some way so beyond. [0:42:10.6]</p> So overwhelming and incredibly difficult to think about. How to attack those issues.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah. That's the other big, to accept that it's a piece. To be gratified that at least that piece is under, is in my understanding. And not to be -</p> Right. Yeah. That's the struggle that I always have is to take a certain amount of pleasure in the little bits and pieces that I'm able to glean and not to be too thrown by the lack side of the equation. [0:44:12.7]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Right. Yeah. And I guess the fear to ask, you think you have a strong opinion to working with a woman or a man is going to make a big difference or - ?</p> Can I ask something very blunt? Do I come off as misogynistic in anyway? Is that the right word? The expression a man who dislikes women or - ?</p> There's a phrase, which I've heard, it described as some men, as misogynistic or misogynist or something like that. A man who betrays an inner -</p> Inner hatred or -</p> It would be, and again, I may not be, it might increase, it might make me aware of something that I'm just not seeing. I don't feel, I've described this kind of love/hate relationship that I have.</p> So I think it's a mixture. But I'm hoping that I come out on the neutral side about it at least. If not more. But it makes me nervous in my relationships with women whether I'm appearing to be oblivious of the fact. It was one of those guys who just doesn't get it as they said a few years ago. As the kind of guy who doesn't-[0:48:15.7]</p> Okay.</p> Yeah I see that. Except that I can see that you are enough of a nurturing, healing kind of person, that I think that even if you felt, I don't think I've ever doubted that there is overall a sense of desire to be helpful to me. No matter how ugly or venomous a person I might seem. I think your thing in life is to help people in therapy. So -</p> My question is, does that -  are you going to give me any -</p> It's not an, can you give me some comfort and say that it doesn't seem to a preponderant side of my personality or my style of operating. I don't come across as obviously a woman hating kind of person.</p> Okay. I think I accept that.</p> Yeah.</p> Okay. All right. Well thank you very much. Let's see. The next Thursday is the fifth. Yes. Yeah. That's great. Okay. [0:50:45.4] [end of audio]</p>",1

I kind of rebel against it. I've never... I never had a job where I was like 9:00 to 5:00 then I would... and it's been an issue in therapy before. It's an issue with my wife and... and... and I think it... it becomes perhaps a focal point perhaps for... for being... for rebelling, I think, in some ways or for... for... and maybe an expression of... of anger. I think that by being late... and lateness and stuff like that. I... [10:11]</p> No. It hasn't...</p> I... no.</p> No, I don't know. No. I mean, today I was just like zoned I mean. I... it has perhaps... I think it's happened maybe on one or two occasions. Maybe that one time I came in here remember and... and I was just... I was kind of worked up within myself and I think the... and I was saying to myself... I was like giving all the reasons...</p> Right. Right. And... and there... there was definitely some anger. I mean, whether it's directed... exactly where it's directed I don't know really. I mean, it's... I don't know. </p> Head.</p> Yeah.</p> I don't... except that there's a little thing about it, of course, my perception of you as a... an authority figure and... that you're a... in some way, of course, controlling my schedule or controlling, I guess, in that sense. It's a...</p> Right.</p> Yeah. Yeah. And... yeah. Of course, I always seem to be like frenetically busy but...</p> How do I feel right now about it?</p> Well, I... well, the... I mean, of course I... I thought about it and I thought, ""Well, when is really a good time for me? I don't know."" Well, of course, the weekends are easier for me, but then again it takes away from the weekend. So, it's... it's damned if you do, damned if you don't really, ultimately. [13:32]</p> Well, yeah. I mean, having to come here and I wanted it to be done with and, I mean, in that sense there was frustration. Yeah. Like... yeah, I'd... I'd like... I... I... it's like I wish you could write a prescription and say, ""Here, take these pills. You'll be fine. Goodbye."" Not that I'm a big pill taker but...</p> What feelings? I mean, it's like I would... it would be... well, there's feelings like what... why am I so messed up? Am I really messed up or... or, no, I'm not really. It's like I'm thinking, ""Why does the world have to be so complicated? Does everything have to be so complicated? Things should be much simpler."", and I... I almost... yeah, it's like I... when you hand me a prescription or... or... or like... or maybe grab me by the collar and say, ""You got to do this. You got to do this."", and... and... [15:17]</p> Feel a little bemused and, I guess, I think perhaps I'd like to do that to you as well to some extent.</p> Well, I think that there's also... well, this... this feeling of like being... I guess it has to do with like you being an authority figure and me being in like kind of the hot seat and having to perform or to... and also that... yeah, that you're kind of an observer, but you're active but at the same time you can sort of sit back at some... some level and be detached and not kind of be invested in... in, I guess, quite the same emotional way or some... some like that... I don't know, but there's a certain... I guess, it's like you're omniscient in some ways that I'm not and so, I guess, a feeling like, I don't know, like you have all the answers or I want you to have all the answers and... and... but at the same time... I guess that it's... it's like a... but it's not like a level playing field. But, of course, I'm coming here because of your expertise, but at the same time that puts me at some kind of insubordinate position in some way, in some sense. I'm coming to you for help and... [17:48]</p> Well, my wife says I don't like to ask for help...</p> ...and I think it's true. I want to believe, I guess, that I'm like just a rock, self-contained; that I can get... that I could deal with anything. So... I think furthermore that I shouldn't, of course, goes back to that I shouldn't ask other people to give over for me; about some posing or something but... but it's also more than that. I think it's... I have to... an admission of weakness and...</p> Well, I was thinking... I don't know. I guess it was sort of exasperation. It was... well, it was like more like... it was like what I'm thinking as I'm speaking, ""What... what weakness do I feel or what... ""</p> Right. Well, weakness is... it's vulnerability and weakness is... and vulnerability is something that I want and I don't want in the sense that I want to be able to be vulnerable. I want to be able to be open and open myself up, but I also don't want to be exposed to risk, to... to being hurt or... or in any... in any way being ridiculed or being not accepted, being rejected. </p> Yeah. I think I... I mean, I think I have felt that. I mean, I... I know have and it's... it's a... I don't know. It's very emotional. I don't know. It's very necessary and longing to really give over and to...</p> Um hm.</p> Well, it's... it's like wanting to... well, maybe it's too pat to say like, ""return to the womb"", but something that... to be just completely enveloped and... in... in a... in some kind of supportive, completely understanding, completely... just feeling that I could abandon myself freely and be loved and be cared for and... and a... [22:51]</p> Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Not have to deal with life's jagged edges or... but... yeah, really, like enveloped in some kind of bubble or something to...</p> Protect it, yeah, and not have to worry about what people think or what... what... what I think or... I mean... or just, yeah, very much a... a giving over of... of myself and... and being up.</p> Um hm.</p> Right. Yeah. Then it's like... and, I guess, the aspect of it being on schedule lends to my kind of a mechanistic... it's not...</p> Yeah. I mean, it's just... yeah, and it's as if all the things, all the feelings, all the things that go on are my inner life, outer life, I don't know, and I come in here and they kind of... it's like I try and focus them into it. And then I go away and it's... and everything it's like entrophied (ph). [25:08]</p> Well, no. It's... it's like I'm... well, actually when I was in therapy before, I thought of this before, but it was... I sometimes characterize it as being my haven and my battleground at the same time, which I think this is. It's a haven, but it's also a battleground of a different sort, of course. When I go outside, it's... I'm... when I go back to work, it... of course, it's like I'm just thrust back into that situation and then I'm back in the kind of same mindset. I think that at times I think about what goes on in here, but it's probably really not so pretty small fraction of the time. Most of the time I'm just dealing...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. </p> Yeah. And I tell my... I'll tell myself on the way out different times that... I tell myself, ""I'm going to think about what we've talking about and I'm going to do something about it. I'm going to go out and try and work on some of these things."", but it's not... and... and then sometimes I do think about it, but most of the time I really... I don't. I mean, I'm... I'm there. I'm like... it's like I'm just...</p> Yeah. Yeah. Or I'm back in the same kind of rut or way of doing things. It's...</p> Um hm.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And there's... and the... I guess, of course, there's... there's the thing with... it's like if I open myself up too much in here, by the end of the 50 minutes I got to go outside... back out again and I'm feeling like raw or whatever like that. It's like... well, you got to like suddenly... you like throw... douse my head with cold water or... but... and that... I don't... it's felt that way maybe in one or two occasions that I felt like I've allowed myself to open up so much.</p> I don't think so really. I mean, it's not like I'm thinking about that. That it's well, ""I'm going to have to get out of here and so I'd better not say anything."", but... but it's... but it is something, I don't know, that... that I'm aware of, I guess on one or two points and then I've left. And... but I... I actually I... I don't know, there's something that I... that's holding me back. I think I find that every thing's holding me back. [29:19]</p> Right. So...</p> I feel fairly open. I also, of course, feel pretty bleary but...</p> That's... that may be true. I... I... well, that's what I was saying maybe it's not such a bad thing. </p> No. I... I mean, I feel safe. I think it... it surprised me that... in a way that... that I would feel as comfortable as I do and which I did, I think, fairly from the start. I mean, part of it, of course, is really wanting to have something like that, but at the same time I think I came in having a real... I mean, it'd been a long time since I had been in therapy and had had... and I had questions about having a male therapist in my... I mean, it was actually I wanted a male therapist.</p> Because my... I had a... a woman initially, Rex, and then when I was in counseling...</p> A couple' treatment, I was also... and... and I thought I, ""Well, maybe it would make a difference maybe."" I'm hoping. I had a feeling that maybe I was holding back.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. In some ways perhaps. Just kind of whatever. Male chauvinist tendencies. No, I don't know. Not really, but... but that it would make a difference and my... my feeling would be... and it does, I think, make a difference. </p> Um hm.</p> Yeah. Well, my sense is that you... I mean... I may regret these words, but I mean it... I don't think I'm as... I mean, I... I talk a lot about my vulnerability and what not, but I think the armor there is very, very strong. </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. And... well, what was I going to say? And it... it's funny. I mean, you point out when I'm talking a lot and I go, ""Aaah"", or I'll sigh or something like that less frequently. But there I'm like... [33:53]</p> Well, you do and I think it's good, and it... it's very annoying, but I think in a sense it's... it's good too, because I know that... I don't even... I'm not even conscious of it.</p> It's like, ""Oh, gosh, no. I have to think about what I was thinking about."", or, ""Or what was I feeling?"", and it's... it's hard for me to sometimes grasp it. Sometimes it's right for me, but other times I don't even know where that came from. </p> Yeah. Yeah. Um hm. And I was thinking I think, ""God, you have to ask me that again?"" </p> Well, because it was.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah.</p> Okay.</p> Yeah. That I should feel... I...</p> Sure. Yeah. And I was thinking that after; like why don't I just say it?</p> But...</p> Yeah. I agree.</p> I'm looking for my bag. I don't...</p>",1
1000016546.txt,"I got it clipped.</p> My hair.</p> (Inaudible at 0:00:50.5).</p> You took no vacation, huh?</p> Was it good or bad?</p> I'm in a bit of turmoil today.</p> (Inaudible at 0:01:20.2). Well, yesterday I quit my job. And so, like, the last couple of days - and I'm not quite sure why I quit it. I remember I woke up in the morning - well, the day before this girl, Susie, who has been dating three of us - I don't know if that was the final...</p> No, no, this is Susie, the one that I've been dating. I saw her last Saturday and I was supposed to call her up. And on Wednesday - God, this gets me so mad because she - what she said - she said she might have to visit her grandmother on Saturday. And so I looked at her really funny and I says, ""Oh, come on."" And she said, ""No, really."" So I believed her. 0:02:29.4</p> And she says there's - she's going to, you know, limit it to one guy, one of the guys she has been dating. And I said - I says, you know, nice to tell me on the phone. Thanks a lot and all that. And I talked to - I don't know, then I was getting a little sore because I couldn't figure out, you know - unless she's PD or something, I don't know what the hell's wrong. And just then there's a knock on the door, and all these people came in so I couldn't say much of anything else.</p> No, no, no, I mean, not much. I just - I said it pissed me off and I couldn't really understand why, you know, because I knew that it was really a strain on her, you know, to be dating three guys. And then I guess the thing was, I was very content the way things were. 0:03:45.1</p> But, you know, when she told me that, well, then all of a sudden I said, ""Oh, shit,"" then I was kind of - well, in a way it kind of - well, you know, well, I was angry and I felt shot down and all this other shit. And then I says, you know, how come it never is that until a thing breaks up, you know, that I realize, like maybe I would have liked to hang in there.</p> Yeah, or if - I don't know (inaudible at 0:04:24.2). Well, that put me in an unhappy frame. Then I got mad because the knock on the door was, you know, this girl - well, a girl named Kathleen who I used to date, but now she's, you know, going with another guy. But we play bridge. In fact, this is the girl that I went through the abortion thing with. So she wouldn't go away. I says, you know - I knock it off for ten minutes at least. But she - you know, she wouldn't leave. So then everybody came in.</p> Yeah, well, I - I just says, I said, why, you know, really why? And it's getting close, like, where I got to decide on school. And my head's in no condition to decide on school. So I said, fuck it.</p> For next year, yeah. If you want to make a decision on school, you've got to decide, like, nine months prior to wanting to get in. And I'm not all that convinced I want to go into social work either. And so I said, well - this is the part I'm not too clear about why I did it. You know, because I said all morning long - I said - you know, I tried to put it through my head, was it just - since I had been rejected, was I going to reject, you know, the job and say, screw the world? 0:06:25.7</p> And I even - I - well, I submitted - I submitted it as a resignation. And then I - there's something kind...</p> It had something to do with that for once in my life I wanted to make the choice. That - you know, it doesn't make sense, but I wanted to make a choice.</p> Yeah, yeah, I think that, you know - I think that was part of it. But what it did was that it was kind of like, you know - I said, okay, now I have a choice this morning of going to work and doing something, which I'm not particularly happy in doing and doing something, which I didn't really choose to do in the first place, you know. So I said, if I quit, you know, just outright quit, walk out of the place, then - you know, then at least I would have a feeling that if I ever come back, or if I ever do anything again that's it's something I want to do.</p> No, I almost started balling, it surprised the hell out of me because, you know, I had to walk in and then I wanted to go at a time when all the - see, my unit, I really liked the people in my unit. And some of them are - well, I'm (inaudible at 0:08:51.2) especially close to three of them. And the other lady a little bit too. And three of them were all there. I walked in, I thought maybe Mrs. Easter who is the supervisor would be there and I could just give it to her and get the hell out of there.</p> Shelly.</p> I always call her Wesley. I always call her Wesley. And Courtney, I told her too. And we talked it over for a couple of hours, especially with Wesley. And I don't know. Then - well, then it got really hard to talk to them anymore. So I just left.</p> Uh-uh.</p> You know, they submitted the thing this morning. Which, you know - which is...</p> Yeah, I did, I gave two week notice. But the two weeks are three personal business days, two - they call the thing comp days and then a week of vacation. So, you know, it's in and last night - you know - well, last night I went out and got a little bit smashed too. But I was thinking about - you know, I says, okay now, you can hedge a little on it, I said. You can tell them that you just want it to be a - you know, like a leave of absence. 0:11:00.8</p> And the other things, I don't know (inaudible at 0:11:34.9). My head is really...</p> It started - I don't know, it started even when I was home.</p> Well, at home my sister and my brother-in-law and my ma and I sat down one night, you know. Well - and we were talking, you know about - we got into - like, my ma wants to leave. And she's got this older brother and this older sister and her mother so she can't really leave the town because she would feel guilty and all this crap, and they use her, you know, I mean, they - she's been enslaved to them her whole life I think. 0:12:37.4</p> And - well, we talked a whole lot about that and, you know, I says, ""Ma, you know, why don't you just try enjoying your life for a change and, you know, just letting those people go. Why don't you just do whatever you want to do?"" And then we said a whole bunch of other things. I don't know if they're that important. But the thing that kind of came across to me was that, you know, here was a 60-year-old woman (inaudible at 0:13:14.8), what is my ma, 60.</p> You know, and my ma's kind of got, like, aches and pains all of that. She's got a bad back, she's got a bad knee.</p> No, she doesn't complain.</p> She's got - well, she started limping. And I said to myself, okay, you know, like, she's 60. And she says, like, when she sits alone and she climbs up the walls, you know, she doesn't know what to do with herself. She got - you know, she takes pills sometimes. There's not that many friends that, you know, she calls friends. And she's afraid to take off. I really wonder how much she knows herself, you know, what she's all about. 0:14:14.7</p> She's facing the latter part of her life alone, you know. And I don't really know the meaning of the word ""alone"" or to be lonely. I mean, I have never felt that. But she must have felt it. And to not have the resources, you know, to...</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, or...</p> Yeah, yeah. And she says stuff, like, ""If you go anywhere,"" she says, ""You always, you have someone"" like, she was telling my sister, but she doesn't, you know. (Inaudible at 0:15:01.5). One night when I went to bed and I thought about it, you know - I think I even started crying. It was just - I think I was crying not so much for that, but I said to myself, you know, when I reach age 60, I want to have all that - you know, I want to be able to deal with that, and have it worked out in my head or wherever it's worked out. And... 0:15:23.5</p> Yeah, see, I talked to Shelly about that. Shelly is about 50 at work. And she says whatever it is I'm talking about she worked through when she was younger too.</p> Well, she always - she kind of says, like, you know, like, what's she going to do now?</p> She always says she's going to go south as soon as her health, you know, gets better. Well, I know I got it - well, I don't know, I got after her on a couple of things. I made, you know, comments about the way it looked to me was that, you know, she always has had the people around her, you know, to tell her what to do or else she's always had the kids.</p> And then she - you know, that - I says, ""You don't - I don't think you even know what I'm saying."" But I said, ""But I don't think you can go south because you'll feel so damn guilty, you won't enjoy yourself anyhow."" I think that's what I was trying to say to her, you know, that that's what was going on. I don't know. 0:17:21.8</p> And she said stuff, like, when my sister and I used to run, my grandmother had real long hair. And we used to run through my grandmother's hair, you know, before she was going to wash it. Then she said this one thing - she says - I can't even remember the right word. She said, oh yeah, she said, ""I remember once when I learned never again to trust my mother,"" you know.</p> It was something like - you know, because it struck me and I says, you know, ""When was that?"" When my sister was little, I even remember too because I remember it was such a horrible thing. My sister loved cottage cheese. And she's always, you know, eat it like mad.</p> Sure, and one day my ma had horseradish on the table. And my sister asked what is this? And ma said it's horseradish or, I mean, it's cottage cheese, you know.</p> Yeah.</p> Well, I don't know. I imagine she meant it as a joke, I don't know. So my sister takes a big scoop of it and almost choked. You know, and she started crying and everything else.</p> I don't know, it was when we were still in - she must have been five, six, something like that or maybe even younger. Because I remember it - I remember she really started coughing. And - but, you know, it was that same thing.</p> You know, the thing with me.</p> My thoughts are all disconnected.</p> Well, she remembered - yeah...</p> She remembered - that was the second thing she could remember.</p> And she said she also remembered that I was always spanked. That I always...</p> But I don't remember getting spanked that much. But I remember that I always caught - she says I caught the hell. And she said that - she said she was the one that would always watch me. And then when I caught hell, she knew enough not to do it. But I was always the one - always heard her when I caught hell. And she even remembered the thing I remember too. One night I was out in a carnival. And I was having such a good time and I forgot to look at the clock. And then I realized what time it was, it was, like, almost twelve. And I came running home and it was a small town. And my ma made me stand up, I remember that until I got so tired that I - and she kept waking me up when I - you know, almost collapsed.</p> I can't remember getting...</p> No, I can't remember catching hell that much.</p> Oh, that I knew, yeah. But I can't - she says all these times that I was always the one that would catch the hell. And I - I can remember that, but I cannot remember that many other times specifically where I caught it, you know, other than - I can't remember ever being spanked. Maybe it was another kind of - I don't know. 0:22:03.3</p> No, she - no, well, no, it goes this way. We always get together on - like, at Christmas, not this Christmas. She had it at our place. But when we're over there, and it's just started, like, in the last five, six, seven years, when we go over there, you know, you have the big main dinner. And then you, you know, you sit around. We usually watch football, which she hates. And then - but then toward evening, you know, everybody's kind of back and we're talking and stuff. And it's like she's not really a part of things. And she wants not to be a part of things, and she almost kind of sits by herself sometimes.</p> And she - and then she knows that, you know, she knows that that is irritating to me and yet, you know.</p> Yeah, I go. I'm...</p> I don't know, I - I guess at the time I never thought about it. But why I mention that is that when those people are over at our place...</p> You know, then the reverse is - if they say they want to go home, then she doesn't want them to go home.</p> Yeah. And then - but what I - the only thing I can figure out is that's what she thinks of herself.</p> Well, I don't know, but to me...</p> Well, I usually stall a lot.</p> Well.</p> Well, I'd be going against...</p> Okay, I can see that. I could see that, you know, that I - that really is weird that I would ever, you know, assert what my thing was. I would do it in other ways. You know, I'd never say, ""No, I'd rather stay."" Or else she'll say stuff - well, she would say stuff if I wanted to stay, would take two cars, you know, and then she could leave. I mean, that's never happened because I would always leave. But sometimes I'll...</p> Well, it's two towns - they live in different towns when we go over there. They did another thing, there was another thing at home. This old routine, the old guilt routine because this guy - I'm 27 years old. So we get all done eating and, you know, my ma says, ""Johnny will do the dishes."" You know, I'm going to do the goddamn dishes. So I said - you know, I didn't cross her up, you know.</p> Because I don't cross up my mother.</p> I'm tending away from that (inaudible at 0:27:01.1).</p> Yeah, I never said that to my ma.</p> Hurt my ma's feelings. All right, if I would have said...</p> Yeah.</p> Except I said I would do them in two hours.</p> No, I usually would have stalled before. Why did I (inaudible at 0:28:56.0). Why did you say it would be my feelings that would be hurt?</p> I don't get it, well, why would it be my feelings?</p> I'm trying to make the connection if I'll do it. You mean if...</p> I laugh at her.</p> I mean, if she used those words I would laugh at her. But I see what you're - I see, you know, I know what you're saying. But I'm just trying to say - I'm trying to feel or to see exactly how she would do that. She wouldn't say that, she would use a way to do that.</p> Yeah.</p> See, the - yeah, the thing...</p> Yeah, for not...</p> Okay, there's one - yeah, there's one thing. Don't let - I just want to say one more thing. Don't let me forget the thing about that - really, because it didn't register with me at all that it's my - you know, that it's my feelings that would be hurt.</p> I mean, that - I want to keep that in my head. What happened after that, I said after dinner, you know, I would rather sit and talk for a while. There's no need to go Goddamn running into the kitchen and do the dishes. I didn't say that. I says, I'll do them two, you know, like, two hours later.</p> I don't know. I said, I - you know, when I was driving back from Iowa, I says, ""What, a 27-year-old doing the Goddamn dishes.""</p> I don't know. It would upset her I imagine.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I was just going to ride to the defense of my ma.</p> Yeah.</p> She can't really, though.</p> (Inaudible at 0:33:15.5) you to tell me what to do.</p> Okay, I'll say what happened then. I didn't do them right away. I went over and I sat down. I said, you know, ""I'll do them later."" Well, there was this other woman named Margaret who's my sister's, you know, relation, who is about my ma's age too. Well, and she's - she just says this is the way it is. So she - a little while later, seeing as how they couldn't sit and talk, she gets up and walks into the kitchen and starts doing them. 0:33:53.7</p> Yeah, yeah, if it would have been my ma going in there, I don't think I could have made the connection. But I saw exactly - you know, Margaret went in there. And I watched my ma - maybe this is what I was trying to - I watched my ma, and my ma immediately felt guilty, you know, went in and started helping her.</p> And then I was sitting there thinking, ""Well, I was the one that was - you know."" She was saying, ""Johnny, you were going to do the dishes."" I says, ""I said I'd do them later."" But see, I couldn't - if she would have got up and started doing them herself, then...</p> Yeah, then I couldn't have - then I probably would have gone along and helped. That was her way. That was always her way. If she wanted to get me she would start doing it. 0:35:01.9</p> And then I'd naturally, you know - I'd get mad and I'd...</p> Naturally, I'd get up.</p> Yeah. My sister once wrote me a letter and she said - I was seeing a girl in St. Paul. And it was - oh, it was a mess. And it wasn't going anywhere anyway. But I really liked the girl. And so my sister sent me a letter saying - you know, it was a cuss out letter saying I had better come home because that's - that my ma only lived for the times when the kids would come home.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. What I wanted to say is, don't most people see their mothers, you know, like once or twice a year?</p> But maybe most people don't do it because they feel obligated to (inaudible at 0:36:33.5).</p> Yeah, but I - well, the other times I didn't even think about what was going on.</p> Yeah, yeah, of all the girls, that's the only girl I've ever told her that I loved. Another thing my ma said was that she wanted to come up and pay a visit, you know.</p> And I said - I don't want her up here, really I don't.</p> I don't know, I just don't want her up here. And I said not in January. And she said maybe later. And I don't really want her to come.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I wouldn't mind a couple of days, but if she'd stay, like, a week, I wouldn't want that. When she came to Texas she stayed two and a half weeks.</p> And usually I'm not quite capable of that, no. I don't think I want her to come here right now. You know, I can't make the connection. Why would my feelings be hurt if she - if she would - okay, if I'd say...</p> Okay, but why wouldn't I - all right, you know, if I would do the thing - she gets up and starts doing the dishes or something like that or, you know, ask me if I would do it and I say no, I won't, you know, and she goes ahead and does it anyway, and then I'd feel guilty, although I'd tell myself she's doing it. So I would tell her to do it or I would try to help her do it.</p> Well, why should - I mean, why...</p> Why should - I mean, why should I feel guilty?</p> You know, that's so because it never - it never comes to the point where things are - you know, it's always like subtle things like that, which I've grown so accustomed to that I don't - I don't notice those things. I'm oblivious to it.</p> She did a thing one year when I was - when I was home. (Inaudible at 0:41:55.9). She left the house for something like two days. And my sister and I didn't know where she went, and she wouldn't tell us, she just came back. But I remember I was just - I felt, you know, like I had done it. I had made her do that. I drove around the town looking for her, all kinds of things.</p> I can't even remember, it was something - my sister and I were teasing her. And usually if we start really going on her we can - she usually never would get mad, she kind of likes it. But that time - I can't remember if it was that - it was something that touched her off, and boy, she wouldn't talk, she (inaudible at 0:42:58.9) and she left.</p> Yeah - yeah, when she does, she...</p> I remember once when I was little too she said, she was making a couch and she was upset about something. And she just said, ""I wish I were dead."" And I remember - somehow I thought, you know, I made her feel that way. And I don't - all I remember her saying that night, the feeling I had.</p> Yeah.</p> (Inaudible at 0:44:25.2). How can it be my fault, though?</p> I don't know, I can't - you know, I can't remember. I can't remember anything.</p> But if I was the one that always caught the hell - see, that isn't coming through, but if I am the one that always caught the hell, I would guess that that - that some way or other that, that would mean that I'm the one that's responsible for my ma's problems.</p> I'm the one that, you know - I'm the one that's punished. It's funny because I can't - I can't remember getting punished all that much. My sister said I always caught it. And my ma said she couldn't - finally it got to the point where she couldn't discipline me anymore by spanking me. She'd put me in corners. See, I can't - it will not sink in on why - you know, I know what you're saying when you say this thing about my feelings will be hurt, but I can't understand that. 0:47:11.5</p> I can't - you know, I know and I know what you're saying, but I can't...</p> She would make me feel sadistic?</p> If you yell at your mother.</p> Then you - then she's not going to love you.</p> That's not...</p> That's not obeying, though, and you should obey your mother.</p> Yeah, I guess. But even if you do obey your mother, you know, that doesn't mean that she loves you anyhow.</p> I don't know. I don't think she could deal with that. I really don't think she could deal with it. I don't think if - I don't even know if I'd ever tell her.</p> I'd probably lie.</p> She'd disapprove.</p> Say what?</p> No, she knows that. The bar thing she (inaudible at 0:51:52.0).</p> The bar thing she knows.</p> Is there any (inaudible at 0:52:11.6) about 14.</p> Oh, I wanted to make sure I read (inaudible at 0:52:23.5).</p> On - to have an adjustment made on my fees, who would I contact?</p> Um-hmm. They're really going to close it in June, huh?</p> Yeah, I can come any time. My time is pretty open.</p> Okay. My friend Susie is going to get (inaudible at 0:53:33.4).</p> She's going to get (inaudible at 0:53:35.4), she was going to come here too.</p> No, she signed up, like, about three weeks ago.</p> Maybe she's not interested anymore.</p> This is the one that...</p> Um-hmm.</p> Okay.</p>",2
1000017880.txt,"And I think lots of things happened to me last night because I was just thinking about that afterward. It was like a weird thing like, like some of the old hangups that I'm starting to get out of. I started to see those just a little bit because I realize now I could - I didn't even put my finger on it before, why I liked this older fellow in aerobics, Professor Blackwell and my instructor now whose about sixty, they're both about 60, and it didn't hit me that like what I was seeing in them was an older man. I just realized this coming which is so funny because I was thinking about, ""Now why do you have such an attraction to him?"" And like last night what happened is he almost didn't - he was talking to two of us, this other girl and myself, and we'd, my girlfriend and I had just had a discussion the day before about some people can attract fellows and have them fall all over them and some people can't. Well I can't, you know. So like I cried about that or... [inaudible at 0:01:01.6] ...but I cried because I thought it was so sad, because like I just don't have that, right? And it was like saying (ph) again like it was an inadequacy. And then afterwards I said, ""Well look, I never had it so what's the big deal."" Like I've always had boyfriends...but I haven't had like men or walk into a room and everybody, every guy goes, ""Ah!"" (making sharp inhaling noise) You know like with my girlfriend. Yeah.</p> Yeah, right.</p> Right. And I mean even as far as a boyfriend goes, there is a certain amount of fellows that...are attracted to me, not all fellows, you know. Like my girlfriend just walks in the room and every fellow in the room is going, ""Ooh!"" (chuckling) You know, all over her. But it's like, so then it's that I had to realize that, like it's not going to help any because...I thought at first, I think it really was in the back of my mind, like when I was finished with therapy I'd walk out and all of the sudden everybody in the world would go, ""Oh, here she is! New person, fantastic person, really want to get to know her."" And then I got more down to earth about it and said, ""Well you don't have - so what!"" So I got two new friends and I'm really, really excited about running and I like my teacher and I'm really...wow! So I didn't care. I didn't care that everybody in the whole gym didn't go, ""Oh, here she is!"" You know, ""She's here."" So, but anyway, last night the instructor came up was talking, because we were out at a restaurant and he came in, this is dad (ph) instructor and he's the older man. And so he came up and I noticed that he was talking - well he was standing right by my head. So naturally when you're looking forward, you'd actually be looking more at the other person that was next to you. Then like the first thing I thought is, ""Uh-oh, maybe she's got that appeal and I don't have it."" (chuckling) You know and I just, ""Gurr."" And then like I was with her and her husband and like we always, we give back and forth just about equally, so it's like saying like, ""I must have something in some way or like the fellow involved, not so much in liking me as a girlfriend but I mean like he relates to me. So what's the difference?"" I had, I figured this out, like even if the instructor didn't like me as much as he like her as person or as a whatever, if he thought she was a sexier girl or whatever it was...it didn't make any difference because I could still learn from him and I could still feel about him the way I felt. And I realized it's simpler (ph) that just, ""Hey, is that a great feeling."" Like I don't care, you know? I really, I just didn't care that he, after a while, but...the first thing that came up, because he was like, he reminded me of my grandfather, being as old as he was and being like full of love and...of exuding it like all over the place. And I guess I felt that way because, not because...of him as a man, but I realized this it's like, my grandfather's attention was of his love and that was lots for me, you know. Because I ended up, ended at that night when we were talking about fellows, and...like my girlfriend saying that I really couldn't attract all fellows. I started crying because I wasn't that great...as far as the fellows go, and I ended up crying for my grandfather. You know so it was like what I'm looking for. And then I realized this afterward too, which was nice because my girlfriend said, ""You might only have a couple of meaningful fellows in your life."" And then I said to myself, ""Well you know that might be true or maybe I'll just have one at a time. So what. So I only have one boyfriend and she's got six...hanging from the rafters all over the place, taking her to all these fancy places. Maybe I won't have a fellow to do that but so what!"" Like I need an object in a way to give that love to that I had with my grandfather, you know?</p> And like I don't need six people or eight people or ten people that all care about me at the same time. I only need one.</p> Yeah. But I realized that with my needs I don't, in fact, I don't like having three or four boyfriends. I had it at one time, four fellows going out...trying to keep one straight and make sure that your little sister doesn't open her big mouth and call somebody by the wrong name and all this bologna and I just, it's not worth it, because like maybe out of that four I like one or two. So why date all these fellows if you don't really care for them, just because they're taking you out and they like you, you know? So I said I would much rather have like a give and take, like I had with my grandfather, with one man at a time. Whether I stay with the same man for a long time or whether it's just...like one boyfriend after another boyfriend.</p> It would be like that and so that came to this realization and then it didn't bother me anymore. Because...like why do you need everybody falling all over you if that's not your need? It's not my need you know.</p> Yeah. Well...because I had... </p> Yeah, this is the thing. That's hitting it right on the head because like I've noticed that, like I like that idea of when my girlfriend walks in like everybody's just... </p> ...mills around her. And like when I'll go into some place, well people will talk to me...but it's not like, I might have two or three people even that will sit and talk to me all night and I'll talk to them all night, but it's not like the whole room practically gravitates towards me, you know. So like for a while this really bothered me but now, like I've gone to parties and I will try to get into the group in there and I just can't get into it because like nine-tenths of them I don't want to be with anyway. So then I'll actually, usually find somebody that I can gravitate towards and then we get along. But so what? So I get like what I would call the cream of my crop...that I can just sit with. And so maybe I don't have lots of people around but so what, you know.</p> Right. And it ends up that we usually...that we usually get attracted to each other or like there might be three or four of us...sitting there. And so this is the way I felt like last night finally, because it was like three or four people that all knew this couple that I just met. I mean they knew them already first of all, and so they were calling me like... [inaudible at 0:06:36.4] ...calling me the... [inaudible] ""And whose the other girl?"" ""Oh, the other girl, who me?"" (chuckling) You know, but it was funny. And then - oh something else that was funny too, because I was really proud of myself. I didn't make any airs (ph) about it. They go, ""Oh, the intellectual group is here."" And they said - and I guess he's the editor and I said - oh and the girl's a psychologist, she's in - what does she do? She works with ABC Mothers but she has a degree in psychology. She's not really a psychologist, I think she's got her doctorate. But anyway...it's so funny because they go, ""Oh, she's a psychologist."" And one going, ""Oh, my God. And what do you do?"" I said, ""Oh, I'm the come along..."" That...I come along. (chuckling) And so they just like to have me because... [inaudible at 0:07:15.9] For once I came out and said I didn't....try, I didn't go, ""Uh-oh. Well I'm just a secretary."" Or, ""Uh-oh..."" I just played a joke on them because like I didn't care. I wasn't going to say I was an intellectual... [inaudible at 0:07:25.1] So what. But it was really funny because like they just kind of looked at me funny. (chuckling) But we had, it was really so good that I can get like this now with people that I could never do before, and like a give and take, a perfect threesome... </p> ...with no trying to get the fellow away from her, and the whole bologna is just gone...at least with these people.</p> Maybe it won't be all the time. I mean I shouldn't say that all the time, I should say that it might be harder...in other instances. Maybe it's because like he's not really the sexiest guy in the world to me either, you know.</p> But it wouldn't make any difference before, you know. Before maybe I couldn't stand the fellow but I would still go...good...fellow, fellow, male, and it was really pretty bad.</p> Yeah. And I often, I look at it and I think it just looks so funny because here I am, I'm a girl. If it was an extra fellow it's not quite so bad. But usually when you think of a married couple and then another girl, and I've thought about that but boy, and we get along so well. And like there's no problem in that area, you know? And I go, ""Wow!"" (chuckling) You know.</p> Yeah, that's it.</p> Because I would never think, partly because of the way I was unconsciously, and partly because living with my sister. And my girlfriend and I talked this over and she said, ""I really think better (ph) that you will see a time that you were almost trying to flirt with your brother-in-law...because you wanted a man to pay attention to you, things like this."" Maybe not even in a sex way but just like in a way that could be taken as that way, you know? And so I realized I guess I had...I was looking for attention from the man. But like now it's funny, like now I can just objectively tear down with people as people...not like he's a man and because I like to work as a man. But like I'll say things like - James is a little bit more, he's a little bit more giving of himself or, and he's a little bit more concerned with people in general. Whereas this Cheryl girl is just a little bit more concerned with herself. I mean we're all concerned with people but in...just sitting down and I evaluate them as friends. So it's such, I might even say that he's nicer in certain ways because he's more giving. But then she's less, she's very interesting in her own ways and she shares in that way...like shares experiences and shares things like with us. And it's really nice because, like I can just sit down, I can evaluate them as people and as friends and as what they have to give, and then I try to see what I have to give to...back. But evidently I must have something because we're still going out...they always ask me. ""Oh come on, you got to go out for coffee at least or something."" And it's like... [0:10:08.7]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, that's it. And always wondering, not wondering so much like if you've got a reaction that was bad like or not bad but like in an affront of some kind or like you see that you're stepping on some...un-solid ground for that person, and that you can just, now I can kind of receive it a little bit. And then I can, when I see it I try to correct it. I try to think back, ""Now what did I say?"" And judging from what I know of their background, what could that have...and then maybe rephrase what I said so it wasn't taken... - So like lots of times I say things that I don't think in the way they're taken generally, maybe not just by this person but like generally speaking - it's taken the wrong way and you think, ""Oh my God...you're so stupid, why did you say that?"" And we were talking about that because I wrote this story for an amateur thing, contest, and I said that at least when you do it when you're talking - this is one of the reasons I don't write very often in letters to people that I care about. And it's like because I have a hard time putting down on paper my exact thoughts. And like you can't be there to read that letter with somebody and like if they read it and they come out with something, like a terrible reaction, you may never hear from them again (chuckling) because you said something in the letter that didn't go, you know?</p> And so I always think that, that that's one of the reasons I have a problem with writing because I can't express my ideas, sometimes even talking, but you can change it when you're talking. You can't do that when you're...writing.</p> Right. Well this, yeah, that was a big step for me because it was always the thing, I'm always worried that they're going to reject me and they're going to take their love back and they're going to do this and they're going to do that. But if you're worried more about them, I found this out too. Like last night I found myself just a little bit going back into this, like the playacting, like maybe if I act more interested he'll pay more attention to me. (chuckling) You know or some stupid thing like this and I said to myself, ""You probably look like a complete ass because...like what's the big deal? So what?"" And then I thought again, like I remember someone, a teacher, telling me this, ""That once a teacher..."" Because he was talking basically on Aikido and things like this. ""And once a teacher has a person's attention and he knows it and he doesn't have to work for that person's attention, he's going to work for someone else's attention more. That doesn't mean that he doesn't care about that person that's listening, it just means that he's got to work to get the other person and keep the other person interested because the other person tends to wonder."" You know, and then I think it might not have anything to do with liking or disliking, and even if it does what's the difference? You're still learning, he's still good, he's still got love and you can still love him, whether he...gives it back or not. So what, he's your teacher. And it was really funny because like I came to that conclusion and just, ""Holy cow!"" Because it's just like a whole new thing, that I don't, I might feel it starting to rise up but then I figure out why, and it is because I think of him like, because he's lots older, as this grandfather who had all this love that...he just exuded for me especially, you know.</p> Yeah. Well that's very true because I realized that when I, the big thing, I didn't really care so much about not having all those fellows...like falling all over me, but it was a big thing, like then I was crying for my grandfather because I wanted that special kind of love that you can have only with like very, very few people, really.</p> And so what's the difference? We have all these other peripheral friends, okay...or whatever you want to call them, acquaintances, that's fine. But why have oodles and oodles of people that just kind of like bug you after a while? Because my girlfriend says that after a while she just gets bugged, because like lots of fellows especially dig her. And she says, ""I have no interest in them and I don't want to hurt them because they're nice people."" So... </p> To me, for my personal...benefit. And like it may be for her this is a need or maybe for her it just is something inborn in her that lots of people come to her, especially fellows, mostly fellows, you know. And so, all right that's her thing, she's got it. I don't have it. I have something else. That I have like something that I like to, when I get a relationship I like it to be pretty permanent. It's not like, like she said and I agree, that there are, like especially with fellows, like I'll go up levels and I'll just drop fellows, and I tend to do that a little bit with friends but not so much. This is probably why I usually end up with older people now as friends and people who are already established, because like I can't relate to young girls my age. They act like kids, 21-year-old, 20-year-olds. And I just, ""Ooh."" I have one friend at work whose 20, I think she's 24 or 25, and this is about it...like older girls. Younger girls just, I go, ""Oh, my God...oh! I can't spend five minutes in the same room."" But it's like I understand this and I understand like lots of people won't like me because I don't get along with everybody, and there's not like everybody I care to get along with, but then so what, you know. And so you just, it's just so great because I just come to these conclusions and like I don't care when I walk in some place now. And even if I think, like I thought this one fellow was really sharp looking last night but I think he was eyeing this other girl. I didn't care. You know one time it would've been like, ""Boy, I think I'll go stand on my head for a while, maybe he'll look at me."" (chuckling) I just didn't care. In fact I got mad at him because I had to work out with him and he wouldn't resist. He was supposed to resist and he just let me do it. ""For gosh sakes, will you resist?"" And he went, ""Oh, okay."" (chuckling) You know because it was like, I was saying, ""Like we're here to help each other more or less...and it doesn't make any difference that I'm a girl, you've got to learn to work with weaker people too and you have to be able to help the weaker people."" And more or less is what I was saying. It wasn't just like saying, like, ""You know you got to do this because I want to do it!"" You know? And so it was really good because then he kind of realized that, yeah, it's not going to help her any, it's not going to help anybody any. And a girl has to work out with a fellow to get stronger, you know. But it was so funny because like my girlfriend came up with the same too. She said, ""He thinks he's so great."" I said, ""Yeah, I know. I know it stinks."" First thing I thought was he was good looking. The second thing I though was, ""Boy, he thinks he's something else."" (chuckling) So it was so funny. But like again, at one time if I would've seen a good-looking fellow, especially a good-looking fellow, I'd be like, ""Wow! Now if I can get him, this proves...that I'm a good-looking girl or this proves that I'm an attractive girl or this proves..."" You know whatever it proved, it would prove it...like... [0:16:48.2]</p> ...I'm good enough, so.</p> No, I don't care, you know. (chuckling)</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, and I think there's, I think they are solid. It's just like, I guess I can't realize it. Because like my girlfriend says, ""You still have a hangup on men."" I said, ""Well yeah, I know I got to work that out a little bit."" But I said, ""It's just that..."" It's so funny because like at one time I felt like, oh, I was practically ready to commit suicide and the whole bit, because...it was like I felt so unhappy. But I don't have that unhappiness anymore. I do get like affronted sometimes when like I don't feel like she's seeing the progress in me. Like the other night she said something about - now I don't know what she meant by this - but she said, ""You have to leave people behind you...constantly, if you're growing faster than they are."" And the first thing, again, that I thought, because see I'm still a little bit paranoid...the first thing I thought was, ""Oh Jesus, she must have gone through some more changes quicker than I did and so now she doesn't care for me anymore. She likes Eliza better or she maybe doesn't like me at all."" And then I'm wondering whether, well maybe she means that Eliza is improving faster than I am, because we were used to being about the same level. I don't know. I don't see her that often anymore. But like I've been asking her to go out for lunch. I would take her out to lunch. And I've been asking her and asking her. She's busy this day. She's busy that day. She didn't go to meditation for three or four weeks. I was supposed to meet her and take her out. And I thought, ""Well this sounds like what she's doing is she's avoiding me. She doesn't really want to be...like I'm not that stupid. When you've asked somebody out like six times and they don't want to, they always have an excuse."" They're busy or they...they can't make it that day or, you know.</p> I don't think so. I don't know, maybe. She's got a big hangup with her mother and it's evident that her mother's got her under her thumb. But like she, well she never really did have a hangup with men. She just had a hangup with being kind of hard and then she worked it out herself.</p> Yeah, I, that's what I'm going to have to do, just come right out and say, ""Hey, like what did you mean by that?"" Because I know she doesn't just say something to say it...it either means like, it could have to do with me and Jim, too. It could be Jim...isn't changing fast enough and, but he's not going to be in for a couple of months so why bring it up now, bring it up right before he comes in? This is why I figured that this was not logically the reason and what it is? (chuckling) You know, like what's the big deal? What are you trying to say? Come out and say it so I won't be going around in circles. Because like I can get an insinuation but when it can be taken four different ways, you can take it any way of the four ways. You know, like how do you know exactly what the person means? So I'll just have to come out and say it because it really kind of bothers me, it keeps coming back. Like just what did she mean by that? You know? And yet she says things like, just last week she says, ""Well like when you come down to South America with us to teach for a year..."" So it's like...and then she says like, afterwards this friend said that he's done stuff for her, she's done stuff for him, and when she goes away he'll write to her and everything. They'll still be friends even though she's not in the city, which was insinuating - don't feel like because...I guess maybe because I'm getting new friends now, she feels like I'm trying to replace them because they're leaving...and it's not that. It's just that, well like...I do work two nights a week and then I go running two nights a week. So I'm home Monday and she goes to aerobics on Monday, so we don't see each other very much, you know. And it's like, to me it's nicer. I really do like it, because then you have like a discussion on Saturday and maybe another one on Sunday and that's fine, because then it's like two strangers that haven't seen each other for a while and you can sit down and you can talk for hours. But when you're with each other every night, you just, what can you say? You know, ""I went to work today and I typed 80 words a minute today. Isn't that great?"" (chuckling) You know, she does something. ""Oh yes, one of the kids got snotty."" You know, well...like what can you do? What can you say back and forth when almost everything of your relationship has been brought out? I mean sometimes you think it has gone and that's fine or you've gone some place with fantastic people, but I can sum that up in ten minutes. I don't have to sit and talk for two hours, you know. So I don't know. It's just a funny thing that I'm getting to that point where, as much as I care about her and Eliza, that I don't want to be that close to just two people all the time. You know and I hope that, I guess maybe I should explain that to her too, because maybe she thinks that, that we're being replaced girls, you know. (chuckling) But I never, as a matter of fact that just came up, I didn't think of that before. Yeah. Sometimes I let some things go passed...right over the head. (chuckling) Two months later I realize what I said or did and...how it was taken but I don't know. (chuckling) This is funny. I can't think of anything to say for a change. (chuckling) I usually sit and talk and talk and talk. I don't know. It just, I feel like, in fact you know what I was thinking of saying after I had left there was? Then the next time anyone says what I do I'll say, ""I'm an explorer of life."" (chuckling) You know, because that's the way I feel right now, like life is becoming a big exploration. I don't know exactly what I'm going to do but - it's so funny because like at one time I would've been so uptight because I didn't know what I was going to do. [0:22:00.1]</p> And now I say, ""Well...I'm at that stage where I am now, so what? Like I'm open to suggestions?""</p> Yeah.</p> Right. And...we were talking about that too and talking about the world as a place. And this is why Jim got me so angry one day and I finally came out and told him. I realized when I'd come home I'd be very depressed because all he talked about was all the bad things that were in the world, everything that was bad. And it's like I know there's lots of rotten things. I mean...when you pick up a paper and we see how many things go on and how rotten people are to other people, but not everybody's like that, you know. And so it's like if you're going to temper it or if you're going to say something - this is always my big argument. People say you don't have to have a solution to criticize. But I say in order to criticize something you have to know of something better. Because if you don't know of anything better, how can you possible say - it would be like saying you can't have a two-party system. Okay. Well, all right, because maybe it's not really democratic and you go on and on and on. Well then what's the solution? Well of course to have a three-party system in order to get more people in. But...like if you just come out and criticize and criticize and don't say anything constructive to replace it, then I say well then why can't...like I say maybe that's your opinion, it's rotten. But first of all how do you really reach me? Because all you're doing is saying it's rotten, it's rotten, it's rotten. But if there's no way out of it, it's like saying - I can't really explain it. It's like saying I'm in a rut. I'm in a rut. I'm in a rut. Well why don't you take another job? Well I can't take another job. You know? You say well why? Well I just can't...or I don't want to or I don't want to look or some stupid...question or answer like that. And so...like I felt that way. So it was like... </p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. I got a little too free though for a while. This was funny, like in the office, like I got to the point where I realized my ability and I realized my ability was not all that further down from my boss. It was little things like when I would get something right. I would kind of get angry because when he was wrong, this is one thing that I don't like about him and I don't think he's as manly as my other boss, because my other boss, if he made a mistake would just come out and say, ""Look, I made a mistake. I'm sorry. You know we could do this over, we can..."" Whatever, you know? This one will say like, ""Well even God can make a mistake."" And all these crazy, idiotic...type things. And so I got to the point where rather than being still in my position, which is only a secretary and I shouldn't overstep it, I would find fault as much as I could. And like if I was wrong, I just said, ""Well."" You know? I do the same thing more or less say, ""Well, nobody's perfect."" And then this would get him angered because I was trying to overstep my bounds and get on like an equal level with him and I'm not, as far as society goes, as far as the business structure goes. (chuckling) So it's so funny because I finally came to that conclusion, so I stopped doing this. This was, I started doing it, just like maybe a week ago it started getting worse, and then I like the other day I just stopped it. And then like everything was like 'sir'...and he went (chuckling) you know. [0:25:11.4]</p> Yeah, right. (both chuckling) ""What's going on here?"" He didn't know. Because he never knows what's happening. I'm going through so many changes...like for a while he was always pawing me, now he doesn't. He goes this to me, I go, ""Watch it!"" ""Oh, okay."" And like he never did it again. Like he went to go, he used to slap me on the rear-end and things like this and it used to kind of bug me, but I needed him at the same time, so like I didn't care. Now, (making noise). He took me out to dinner the other night because we were working late and I said, ""Could I have a glass of wine?"" ""Yeah, sure."" I got a glass of wine, the whole bit, (chuckling) a big dinner. And then he had to leave because he had to go to the train, so he went to touch my arm like this. I shook his hand and said, ""Thank you very much for the dinner."" And it's so funny because he used always try to kiss me and the whole bologna, you know. So I was just, ""Thank you very much for the dinner and I hope you have, be careful going home."" Like get lost I'm enjoying my wine, you know. (chuckling) It was so funny. Because it's just like that, I feel like that now. I can do that with him.</p> Yeah, that's right. And like he used to give me this big bologna that he saved me from being fired and I know darn well he didn't save me. It was because I was a better secretary than the other one, who maybe had more seniority but she was a rotten secretary. So...he gave me that story and my girlfriend clued me in on this because lots of Jewish men play this trick if they want to get to somebody...they play these little games. So I don't care and it's so funny. (chuckling) And like with his clients, too. And this is one reason I kind of feel like I'm not really so unattractive, because like I would say the majority of his clients, they come in, always compliment him on me, and like one of them said that he wanted - I said, guess I said, ""Do you want, does Mr. ..."" - whatever his name was, Mr. Czarski - ""...is he going to take anything with him or does he want to take any of this, anything with him?"" And as I walked out of the room he said to my boss, ""Yeah, her."" (chuckling) So when I came back he said, he would, he was going, my boss was going to tell me. ""You know what he said?"" ""No, Brian please don't. Don't, don't."" So he told me later on that that's what he said. (chuckling) So it was like...like this was just sort of like, maybe it is a reassurance, but it's like I realize this now. Like people in the office in that lots of the fellows come up to me first and they want to talk and things like this. And so it's like I do attract like maybe almost, a good percentage of people. And if I, like most of the time I'm very happy with myself. Like most of the time now with the fellows, it's me turning them off, saying, ""Oh, come on...I'll talk to you for a few minutes if I can talk to you, then that's it."" You know like don't try pawing me like at a party or something where they have office people. ""Don't try pawing me."" Like that's, if you want to go out with a girl and you want to have an affair or whatever you want to do with her, you don't do it in front of everybody else she works with and she doesn't do it in front of everybody else she works with. And it's just like that's things that don't mix. (chuckling) But... </p> Yeah.</p> Right, and it doesn't bother me and it used to. Even though at one time, like one fellow I used to talk to in the office, and I really thought he was a nice guy and there might be something there eventually...like we might start dating or something, one party and the first thing I said was, I was kidding with him and I said, ""Are you, did you say you were a Leo?"" And he said, ""Yes."" I said, ""Hey, you know something? Leos and Geminis are supposed to get along."" And I didn't say...like they're supposed to get married or they're supposed to get...involved. All I said was they're supposed to get a long, you know? And then I was going to follow-up by saying, ""How come we never get along?"" You know because it was like we were always, we were always disagreeing, not fight but we'd disagree on things. So he went into this, ""Well baby we can get like..."" And I said, ""Oh, come on."" (making noise) (chuckling) And I got up and I walked away from him and he just went (making noise), and he went over to one of the other little girls that would do...this bit with him, and so it was so great because I could see that. And that was the party I ended at four o'clock in the morning talking to two people in the kitchen (chuckling) and playing volleyball with balloons. We were really having fun.</p> That's right, and even if it means like for months I'll have to sit at home. My one girlfriend sat at home she said for about three months. Because there was nobody that she came into contact with she wanted to go out with. And so that's what I said, I said, ""Ghee."" You know I used to go out with all these jerks and I still, I just wrapped one about two weeks ago that I had gone out with and was just so ah, so much work just to keep...trying to make the other person happy. You know like I try to give now and like oh, it was just like by the end of the evening I was, ""Ooh!"" (chuckling) You know, completely exhausted and a nervous wreck at the same time. So, I decided like it's not worth it. You go out to have fun and if the other person is compatible with you, you'll both have fun. If not, then one person doesn't or both people don't and it's stupid to go out, and then you're...[not going with romantic] (ph) [0:29:55.2] thoughts, for that reason. But it's really nice that...like I can feel this now. That it's not like I constantly use other people as a comparison and other people's, completely relying on other people's reactions. Because when you do, then like sometimes even, this was even like three months ago or two or three months ago, in the aerobics... [inaudible at 0:30:20.8] ...aerobics gym, and like the two instructors were talking to me and we had a real nice conversation going back and forth. All of the sudden I realized and then there was like another fellow came in, all of the sudden I realized there were three fellows there and I was the only other person...the other, well maybe there was another girl but like they weren't talking to her, she was just coming in and she was ready to leave and like nobody was really including her. And I sat there with three fellows talking to me and I became conscious of it, you know. It was like as soon as I did I played a Jodie one. I found myself doing it. It was like I had to come out with smart little, cute remark and the whole bologna. And like when I do it, it comes out either looking ridiculous or sarcastic, one of the two, and I don't know which is worse, you know. (chuckling) But it's like, and I realized I was doing it afterwards but like I just, I really couldn't control it at the time, even then. I just...like I'd say it, like I'd panic. It was like another panic inside like, ""Oh, my God."" And like when I went to say, tell my other instructor that I was quitting aerobics, one of the other girls, Eliza was there at the time when I came in, and she said she asked Jodie if I was on drugs. Because I still get scared when something like this happens. It's like I'll do it! But she said my voice was up like about three octaves and I was just...like really nervous and you could tell it. You could feel like this air of being really uptight. And I just didn't know what else to do because I was trying to figure out which way to tell him and so that it wouldn't sound, it would sound the best way, like...that 'it wasn't your teaching' and the whole bit. I don't know if it was more for me, because I was scared of what he might say or react to or whatever...or a rejection a little bit...fear he'd say like, ""Well good for you. Get out of here because you're ungrateful!"" And all this bologna, and then I would feel...like rejected or what. I don't know what it was. But it was just like a fear, a real fear, like I haven't felt. I'm usually pretty confident with people. [0:32:10.6]</p> Yeah. But it was like... </p> Reject me and oh.</p> And I had like a whole speech practically memorized before I got - I mean that's how bad it was. It wasn't just a natural thing like, ""Hi, I'm quitting aerobics."" You know like, that's all I would have to say. ""It has nothing to do with your teaching. It's just that...this is not my art and my back bothers me sometimes with a hard fall."" That's all.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, I think that's it too. I was afraid that it, when the time I needed it most my communication wouldn't work, because I know it's happened before...or I'll sneak, I'll crawl into somebody else and use them or use their personality when I'm not confident in my own. And I haven't done that lately...like trying to be. But like I said, last night I did that just a little bit. It was like not putting on somebody else but like putting on almost, I mean...like, lets see now, maybe my face will look more interested...that type of thing. (chuckling) Like really I'm very interested. Now come on, throw it over here a little more.</p> That's right, but see it was one time I couldn't control it even...I mean I could. I suppose if I would have faced it. But like I wouldn't face it before, even that I was doing it. It would be like, I want them to like me so I would unconsciously, it wouldn't be consciously copy somebody else, but I would unconsciously crawl into somebody else who is liked by these people, you know? This is one reason I knew I had to get away from aerobics, because I was still - I don't know - but I might have been able to break away from it but it would've been a lot harder, you know. Now it's not so hard. Like...Chrissie and I goof around lots of times and people think we're sisters in the doing this to everybody, because well we do look a little bit alike in face, our facial structure and our build...we're built like pears (ph), like this you know, like this. (chuckling) It's so funny because we both have the same problem being happy. But...it's really nice and yet it kind of scared me just a little bit, but it didn't completely. Because James said, ""You know you two are kind of like sisters. You copy off each other."" But in that case it's not bad I don't think. If it's like, because I sat down with myself and I said, ""Look, you do a certain amount of copying of another person, a little bit, you know?"" I mean in order to crawl, if you crawl inside of somebody else and do everything the way they do, do everything they do and try to react to everybody the way they react, you're going to really get...messed up. But if it's a little bit, if it's like an idiosyncrasy that you might have picked up from somebody because they do it so predominantly...and you just unconsciously pick it up. I said it's almost like a little child learning how to talk or learning how to whatever, they pick up things.</p> This is how you learn.</p> Right.</p> A new thing, yeah.</p> And like sometimes I will do that and she, but the thing is it goes back and forth. Like I write - I don't know what. - I've got some kind of a crazy expression and sometimes I can see we do, not exactly the same thing but like something of the same order. And I'll do the same thing with, I guess, something of hers. I don't realize exactly what it is now, until James brought it to our attention. But I have an idea we probably did do something...like interchange. But still it's like, it is still like a growth and it's not like I want to be Chrissie or Chrissie wants to be me. And for a long time, I know, I really wanted to be like Jodie, completely, you know. I wanted to have everything she had. I wanted to do everything she'd done. Because partly I think, because she was happy more than anything, and because people came to her. And I thought - see this is the misconception - I thought that this is the way it was supposed to be. If you were a really great person that everybody would like you. And this took me a long time, until we had a discussion too and then I thought about it. Well sure, it has nothing to do with your personality being bad or good. I mean if nobody likes you, if there's a point where like, people want to talk to you for five minutes and then they never come back, then there's got to be something wrong with you that you have to correct or something that you're lacking that you have to correct. But if you can get a certain amount of people that you can have as friends and that you can...like really relate to, and you can't relate to everybody, well so what, you know. Then it's just that you can't relate to everybody and that's it or everybody doesn't, isn't attracted to you, but so what, and you're not attracted to everybody else. You know? But I couldn't differentiate between being un-hung-up and free and...being happy and the whole bit and not having lots of people because this is what, for her, was the big thing.</p> You know?</p> So it took me, yeah, it took me a long time to sit down with myself and realize that like...that's the way life is. You are what you are or you don't, you shouldn't even want to change it, except to improve what you have...not try to take on somebody else's...be a second-rate somebody, you know?</p> Right. And see this is probably why, I think, for a time I stunted my own growth because of that. Like I grew in a certain way but I didn't grow, I don't think, healthfully. Because it was constantly, and partly it was constantly, a constant frustration because I always knew that I could never be as good. And like I even told...Chrissie and James, I said like, ""I live with a girl whose almost perfect."" And I said, ""And at times it bothers me."" Even now it's a little bit frustrating. Because like she, everything you say you've done, she's done. And I write this short story and she's got a speech, I mean an award from the city of New York for the best speech in something, back in high school or something. You go, well, (chuckling) better in this area. And she's taken voice lessons, so her voice is better than mine when I go sing and I love to sing, you know. And things like, it seems like every area I go into she's better at already, you know? It's like you think to yourself - well this is one reason too, I wanted to switch from aerobics, because she was very good in aerobics and like again, I was comparing myself with her. And I said, ""I don't need this."" You know? So... [0:38:08.2]</p> That's right. And plus which, actually it wasn't just her, it was apparently aerobics itself. Like it was getting too rough. It was getting too competitive. And I was finding myself competing with the person I was working with which is wrong. You know, at least...the basic philosophy says you don't, you compete against yourself. But now in running I find myself doing that. I find myself competing against me. Not against somebody else, not against what they did and if their performance is better than mine or whatever else, but against - did I do the best that I could do at this time? And then it's improving and it's polishing and then it's...remembering to put the key where it belongs, down here, not like...in the arms and try to be strong because that's not the way you do it. But it's like, it's like now I can say that I'm doing something that I am doing just competing with myself and not competing with either one of my girlfriends. You know like they're both in Yoga, they're both in aerobics, so that's their field...go ahead. I don't really have any particular interest in Yoga anymore as such. You know I mean the exercises I do and the meditation I do but on my own, not...not under somebody else and listening to what they say and everything, but just to sit down and meditate on your own and think about your own life and things. Like just get away for an hour or two by yourself. But, I don't know it's really funny, now that I've done that it's like saying I've broken into a whole new world and I never realized it was out there because I guess maybe I was a little bit scared to discover it for a long time. And it has gotten me to that point where now I'm starting to compete with me and nobody else. I know what my abilities are and like mentally I know approximately what my abilities are. I know I've got a good body physically for...working out and things like this, and that there's no...like there's no reason why I can't be the best person that...I was made to be, whatever that is. And it's just such a great realization to come to. ""Look...I am different from you but then that's the beauty of it."" You know like I am me and I don't want to change me anymore, which is - I mean I want to improve me but I don't want to change me...to be somebody else.</p> Yeah. And it's all, when I came to that conclusion I just said, ""Holy cow! You know here it's been all the time and like I never realized it was sitting there."" And then all of the sudden you just come and like you say well...like so and so had this much - I used to make excuses for why I wasn't as good and things like this. Well so and so had more money or whatever. And I would say, ""Well look, so and so went to college or whatever or went to nursing school or went to finishing school...whatever they did that I didn't."" Well I did go through finishing school but say whatever they did that I didn't do. And I'd always blame it on, like they had money and things like this. And like now they are so much ahead of me only because of whatever. But I'd say, ""I didn't just exist during that time. I learned too while they were learning. I was learning in a different area. I was learning about people."" And now it seems it's so funny because like here I am 21 and I can use this if I want to compare again with other people my own age. I don't know too many 21-year-olds, even in college or even whatever, even if they were smart and they got out of college at 21...like I'm going to be 22, so...my age, that can talk and can relate to people that I can. And like I've never been through formal education. And I mean okay, so they don't use, if they had somebody there that, like my girlfriend, she said, ""If I had someone there that majored in psychology I could use psychological terms."" But she said, ""I can break it down and put it in laymen's terms and get the same idea across...to somebody who hasn't been. And that doesn't mean that they are any less bright than I am or anything else, it's just that I know a technical thing."" She said, ""You can learn it too. All you do is get it and memorize it, that's all. Remember what the 'ises' are and all this thing...you take your Greek and your Roman endings and everything."" She says, ""You learn and you know what this is."" But...I never realized that for a long time, that mostly people come out of college and things like this as that. They'll come out with, they know the technical terminology but not a heck of a lot of them can apply it. [0:42:24.8]</p> I learned it backwards. (chuckling)</p> Yeah. Whereas they don't seem, lots of people don't get down to the basic. They can spout and they can spout what somebody else has or somebody else has done but they don't get to the basic of exactly what that meaning was of what that person did or why they did it. You know and it's like my teacher in reading, she was all excited the other week because she said, ""You got it! You got the basic of the story. I had doctors in here and nobody's, mostly men but some of the women too, they couldn't get this thing."" They couldn't get the basic of the story. And she said, ""I was so happy because you got it. You hit it right on the head, exactly what the guy was trying to say."" After we had started talking...because then like the questions, I had to answer questions afterwards, and the questions sort of build on one another so that, like if I wouldn't have done this I probably wouldn't have gotten that out of the reading...but like with the questions you have to think about it. And once you think, if you can think at all, you'll come out with the answer or at least an answer...like some kind of a deep thought behind it. Like lots of people would just, they'd tell the story...and she said, ""That's not what I want. I don't want you to tell the story. The story is down in black and white. I want you to tell me like what's in it, what's the basic of it."" So it was really cute that she was just, ""Oh! You got it!"" She got all excited. (chuckling)</p> Yeah. Yeah, right. And that, but I think it's so funny because like I'm doing it backwards. Most people - I can't say most people, there are some people who really do learn to think in college. I'm not...downgrading it. But I'm saying like kids start sometimes at 18 and that they're out at 21 or 22 and they've got all the technical knowledge, and like maybe five years later they realize that what they learned back here has really got an application, you know. And like I learned the application or learned to apply things in my own life now, and so I think it will be like a lot easier when I do go to college, because once I learn it I'll be able to apply it to what I already know. And that's something that I really think now that I can say that this is something I've done. So it's not, I'm not really stupid or anything else or I'm not really ignorant because - I'm ignorant in the technical way in the...formal educational way but I'm not ignorant to the fact that, like if somebody tells me something it's not just something to be stored in the memory bank and thrown out the next time you're...with somebody, it's something to be digested and to figure out what they were exactly trying to say by that and what they meant by that and...things like this. And...like lots of people... </p> Yeah.</p> Right. Right. And it's not, it's in my own way and in my own terms now. I mean it's not like...again, it's not like memorizing what somebody else says. 'So and so says this and that and the other thing, because of this and that and the other thing, so this and that and the other thing.' You know? And it's really kind of great because I realize that I have this ability, too.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, right. Right, right, right. And these are other things that are for me outside that are...coming in. Yeah, that's true. It's like, I think one of the things that really stuck with me and I can't really bring it verbatim, but like it's now growing in me more. And it was when, the time he told me it didn't make a lot of meaning or sense but it just stuck somehow in the back of my mind, and this was one of the Gurus that I had gone to [in fact] (ph) for meditations. And he said that there was an old philosopher and he was like a meditator, he was very deep and...with people. And he also went out and he worked with people...the poor and the things like this and then he went back and he meditated on life. And he had two sons - an ignorant old man, can't even write his name, ignorant old man - so they went out and they got, they learned like every language there was to learn at the time...in their, wherever they went to school, and they learned all about mathematics and they learned all about this and all about that. And they came back and all they did was that they handed him all these diplomas and said, ""Look, I can do this and I am the best in this and I'm number one in my class in that and I did that. See how great I am?"" And he looked up and he said, ""So what does that make you?"" Or something in that order. And...I thought to myself, they were doing what I do lots of times. I'll do something and I'll really do it as well as I can and then I'll go, ""Am I okay now?"" You know, like did I get it? Did I do something? And by asking somebody else's approval what you're saying is you don't really believe you have it at all. Here they are going to try and prove that they're the best in mathematics or the best in - so what. You know he just sits there. So he had reached, the guy catches this meanwhile...he knew what he was. He knew that he was...like something higher than just...like just a bookerds (ph), just whatever you want to call it, like a rock, he was higher, he was something that like, he was like a shadow of the God, you know. And it's like he had reached this, he was happy. Here they were coming back and they were going to show him up because they had all this formal education. And it was again, it was like saying but am I really something great because look what I did? You know and underlying that's what they were saying, so they didn't really believe it. And I thought, at the time I didn't understand the story really, and then all of the sudden it hit me. ""Well you dummy, of course! You know that's exactly what they meant."" And I thought well how much more important to be and like - I tried to explain this to my friend and he just, my friend Jim, ""Get yourself to college."" I said, ""I'm going to college."" ""Well you should go full time. Forget that IQ and forget that other bologna. Take out a...loan. Get on campus and all."" And I said, ""Okay, okay, okay, yeah, all of it. All of it."" And it's like I try and explain it to him and yet he'll turn around and say, ""Ah, the educational system is so bad and so irrelevant and everything."" I'm wondering, ""Now wait a minute, hold it."" (both chuckling) So now he admits, now he says I'm too old for it. I said, ""Oh, okay. Now you're changing your mind because I hit you with something...like this."" So it's like he says defensively, ""Oh, no. I meant that when you were 19 or so."" And I said, ""Two years ago, all the sudden I'm an old lady?"" (chuckling) He was... (mocking stuttering). (both chuckling) Oh but it's so funny to try to reach that guy. But...he could only do it because he really has got a lot of nice things in him, he really has. He's just so unhappy with him...but like you can't be that way with your parents or you can't feel that way like your brothers. Like you blame it completely on your parents and you blame this on your parents and you blame this on society, you blame everything and then you can say, ""Now this is why I'm unhappy because society does this."" It's like...but it's not society, it's what's inside you. And if you're happy, and if lots of people were happy, we wouldn't have such a rotten society, you know. Like they always say 'clean up your own backyard'...and like I don't think he ever realizes that...like it's him that's unhappy, not everybody else around him or at least like they don't make him unhappy. I should say, it's him that makes him unhappy. [0:49:33.1]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Yeah, I kind of feel like that because we were discussing black people and why we - we really...like I used to always be saying, ""Well it's because they were slaves."" Like and this is why black people today are very [over there] (ph), but they're starting to get, like the younger people are starting to you know. But like some of the other ones wouldn't work for ten years, they'd walk off a job because they were very irresponsible. And we always traced this back because it was like, well oh, I didn't think I should have brought that argument up, I never thought of it. That they have like a matriarchal society and we have a patriarchal society. You know like the man is always the head and they have the woman as being the one they trace back and everything, she's always been the dominant one. I think that has a little bit to do with it, to the man being so irresponsible in that. I never, I didn't think to bring it in because we were talking about this and...like people who were, just talking about people in general, people who were being...pushed out. Like the Chinese too, they were like practically like slaves and yet look how they've gone. They don't think of themselves as being second rate or they're very courageous in certain areas and things like this. And they're not afraid and they move into business, you know. And why was it that with the black people, generally, that it was so hard, except for maybe just lately, there's like lots of leaders. And I never thought of it but I think it has a lot to do with that. That the man was never really the head of the household because of the slavery that they were...pushed apart, they were like mated, and this just went down and the man just became irresponsible. I didn't think of bringing that aspect into it but now it hits me, you know. But I don't know, anyway with Jim, he's really got a problem that I've got to try to solve or to help him solve. I can't solve it. He can only solve it. And I realize too, like I think - oh another thing she was telling me about too, I think. I have a friend, a black friend named Tanya, and she's going through all sorts of changes. She is very religious or at least I should say spiritual, not so much religious but spiritual, and this is what attracts me to her. But she's got lots of problems with like emotional things...like with her husband and this and that, and I realize she's really got an emotional problem. And, we were talking the other night and what, something that Jodie said made me think of her and my relationship with her exactly, like it was up until the last time I talked to her. It was like I'd call her and for two hours she'd be talking about...like her boyfriend and how she's going to get rid of him. Every time I talk to her and this is like every week and this is going on for a couple of months, she's going to break up with him. ""I'm going to see him tonight. I'm going to tell him this is it. That's it."" And I said, ""Okay."" (chuckling) You know. ""Well I tried to but you know how he is and he talked me out of it."" And all of this, come on, you know. And I finally came right out and told her, I said, ""Look, if you really wanted to get rid of him you'd tell him, 'That's it and I don't care.' Don't give me the excuse you're afraid that he's going to be hurt...because you can do it in such a way that it's nice and he won't be hurt. Or he might be hurt but so what? You'd get hurt a lot more if your husband ever found out about it."" You know I went on and on and on [and hinter] (ph) but I don't, I'm not qualified. And my girlfriend was talking about, like this one girl who used to listen to drug addicts and all this, who would call her up for hours and hours and hours and she thought she was sharing. We were talking about sharing. And she said that wasn't really sharing because like it was a need that was filling. She was being fulfilled for herself. You know like someone would be calling and telling her the problems and then she could feel like she was really needed, I mean she was really doing something. And she wasn't qualified to do anything...she was not trained in that area. How can you possibly help a drug addict when you don't know what you're doing, you know? So she realized that afterwards. And I realized that I was sort of like that with Nell. I would call her or she would call me and it was like she'd be telling me her problems, she'd be telling me her problems. I could tell her. And now she still says she's going to call him after I talked to her, like...and she keeps saying like, ""I haven't seen him but he want's to meet me for lunch."" And then she's like, ""Oh, he can't make it for lunch, he'll make it for dinner."" So last night I guess she went out to dinner with him. And you just, you go, ""Oh, come on! If you wanted to break this thing off you'd up and break it off!"" [0:53:36.8]</p> ""You don't want to break it off. But at least admit it to yourself that you don't want to break the thing off. Because if you can say that then you can logically say, 'Look, either I, I know I either have to give him up or I have to go through that separation'."" That she was thinking about... </p> ...because she is not getting along with Jack anyway, and get on out...do something, but make it positive. Don't be saying...like, 'I'll do it. I'll do it.' And then don't do it.</p> That's all I could tell her... </p> ...because that's as much as I know. I'm not trained. I just said...that's it.</p> Yeah, right. And so she said, ""Well yeah, I guess you're right you know."" So then she said, ""I was thinking about what you said."" I don't know, like I said, I'm not trained. The only thing I can tell her is do that...face, be honest with yourself in other words. You know like I, because I know how hard it is for me to be honest with myself. You know like I said before, like I would get panicky being myself and I'd always try to pick on somebody else's - but I wouldn't say that or I wouldn't even admit to myself that I was doing it...it was just like, I would just have that feeling like, ""Oh, maybe they're not going to like me. He's not going to like me. If I don't do something really fantastic they're not even going to bother with me. And look it, there's three men here, what am I going to do?"" You know and I would get like panic stricken. And now I don't...like I don't care if there's two men or there's six girls and one man or...like what it is and I'm talking to somebody, it doesn't make any difference, you know? And it's just a great feeling to be able to do that now and I could never do that before. And like I guess now it's because, like when you learn something like that, and again, because it's like a new step for me. And it's just something that all of the sudden is there and you're going, ""Oh! Dhu-uh!"" (chuckling) It's like, it sounds like when you walk into one of these, like a casino down in, we went to Atlantic City, and I think I had that sort of the same feeling when I walked into the biggest casino there - I can't remember the name. But like this thing was just, you walked in and when you walk through these great big doors you see the whole thing because you're up a few steps, and it's just like, it's like you want to go like this, it's like overpowering. And this is just the way I feel about...like life opening up. It's just like, you know what I mean, like a little kid looking around, ""Ooh, look at all the lights."" You know? (both chuckling) And it's... [0:55:47.5]</p> Yeah. (both chuckling) Oh, yeah. None of them pay though. (both chuckling) But it's just such a beautiful thing. But then when you've got it or that when you're getting it, you're starting...you're like, I still do this. I still expect other people to come along with me, and like see, Jim hasn't been through anything like this here. He'll do the same thing. ""Well I don't know if there's any therapy down there and I don't know if there's this and I don't know if, I won't have time and I don't have the money and I don't..."" You know, like a million and one excuses and what it comes right down to is he's scared probably, because he knows. If you make that many excuses I think you kind of know that there's something wrong, and that it might be nice to be happy...once in a while with yourself, (chuckling) and I think he kind of knows that. That he's very, he never really feels happy.</p> Yeah, this is the thing. See this is one of the reasons I kind of was afraid of therapy when I first started, because it was another thing that Jodie had gone through see. And like I said, ""Well because she went through it doesn't mean that I'm going to get anything out of it."" But like I think - I don't know - maybe I'm wrong. Like we're a little bit different and her mother also went and like...and I know people who are going into psychology are supposed to go through a certain amount of hours too and things like this. And like I say it's like all this is, is just like finding out a little bit what you are and...like try to figure out where your hangups that you have came from so that you can at least...like relate it to them. Like it was so funny because that was the first time that I would be thinking about one thing, like with the boys, the fellows, like they didn't all care for me and then go into, like it was really my grandfather. Like what I really wanted was a love I had with my grandfather that I didn't have anymore and that this is what I was looking for. It was like a special type of affection that's like I probably never will find again, you know. And so it's kind of silly to look for it but at least I know that this is what I was doing. And like a while ago I wouldn't know, I'd just be going, I would just feel like, I feel miserable but why I don't know, you know? And that's the worse thing in the world. It's like that's why I always feel sorry for like when people do something really rotten, like get a dog drunk or something, because the dog just does not know it's wrong. He knows he's feeling ridiculous and like he's falling all over and he gets scared. Like if he went to walk down the stairs or something he'd probably fall and break his neck...and it's like, it's the same way or like a little child just doesn't know. They don't know why they don't feel well...but they just don't because...like they've got a tummy ache or something...and it's the same difference. And I think to myself, it's so awful not to know. And then once you know it's still awful because like then you know you've had a loss...and you still...you understand it like. [0:58:37.9]</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah, to know it. To, yeah, right, to know that there's something there. Like I don't really think that my big problem - like I always thought it was with my father because I was always that, ""There was something there. I know there's something here with my father."" I don't think so, so much, because like I think mostly it was like I didn't care about him because like he was never there. He never really was a father to miss. I was close to my mother, because like I can feel it now coming back. It seems like the last time went I was so happy because when I went to say goodbye to her I could feel myself wanting to cry, and like I never felt like that for like a long time.</p> You know it wasn't like an emotional thing. Like my mother would sometimes cry when I left but like I couldn't. It was just like a very hard, ""Okay, now I went to see her. Now I don't have to come back for a month, a year or so, you know?</p> Yeah, I've thought about that. You know I've been thinking like, I thought maybe I'd have to go a lot longer you know? But like now, I've been thinking like just for the last couple of weeks, like I could keep going but, I'm growing right now so much and maybe there possibly is something else that has to come out yet. That I need help with getting out, you know? But like I find myself now thinking a lot on my own. I get by myself, and I'm by myself like an hour or two hours a day, and sometimes like when I'm filing in there I'm thinking about things and I'm - and like lots of times things will come to me then, just like they're coming to me now. You know?</p> And I'll realize, I'll go, ""Oh! That's why!"" You know? And like I just feel like I don't...I almost feel like it's not necessary anymore. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong but like this is the way I feel. Like I really feel like I'm getting to the point where now I can do most of it on my own, you know. And like it's not, I mean there's still things like you don't know. Like you do things wrong. Like I've done things wrong with protocol in the office and things like this but, just because I didn't know, that's ignorance. But like to me that's not going to come out anyway, it's not going to help anyway because I'm still going to be ignorant, you know. (chuckling) You don't learn anything, you just learn about yourself.</p> Yeah. It's still a little shaky but like I say, I get, I feel a little more strongly about it like every week. That...like I feel like now, well no matter what my girlfriend says...like I'm still supposed to go through all these traumas and everything, but like I just don't feel like I'm going to because like I feel so much better. Like I don't, I haven't been stuffing myself for the last - I don't know - a few weeks I haven't felt like that. I mean I still have a good meal. Let's face it, I've always liked to eat. But it's not like I feel like I have to eat. I mean like when I said that, I think I said that about two or three weeks ago that when I leave here I eat. But I don't, I eat a full meal but not one so that I'm so stuffed I can't see straight. You know it's like I'm hungry (chuckling) because I'm running, I'm walking from...train stations and things like this and lots of times I don't eat breakfast. But, it's like and also the type of thing sometimes when I make a breakthrough and like I really feel a good breakthrough, not like, well about my grandfather. I was just so...I was so broken up, like that was it. Like...I didn't feel like eating. I didn't feel like doing anything. I mean I was going to bed because I was exhausted. But like sometimes I would come back and it would be almost like a celebration because like I found out something (both chuckling) that I didn't know before...and that or like I came to a conclusion that I really should have come to a long time ago but it just didn't come out...somehow it came out when I was talking out loud or something. I don't know what it is. That just sometimes in therapy things will come out that don't come out when I'm on my own. And, but now it's come to the point where, like I said when I came in, like there were things I was thinking about on the 'L' and I was putting things together and wondering why this person is so important and why I don't see it. Like I never saw what my girlfriend saw and should. She said, ""Ah, he's such a great man. He just exudes qualities, and this and that, and he's so confident."" And I went, ""He's a nice guy."" (chuckling) You know but like to me, this wasn't one of those people that really just went (making noise)...like that and yet the professor was and so was my instructor. And it's partly the age because he was an older, mellow, partly it was he was mellow. A mellow, deep, like a calm love you know. And it's like this is how my grandfather was. And so this is...this is the type of...thing that I look for because it's the type of love that I'm used to...that I learned when I was little. And like I think I'm sure my mother and I had something. I think my mother gave me lots of love when I was a baby because it sustained me through and I can come back to it now. The other thing is...I do have one problem, maybe it's just because I don't understand the word. But my girlfriend is trying to like, ""Sometimes you don't understand what giving is."" And...I'm going, ""I try."" You know like I'm always getting little presents and things but she says, ""That's not complete giving."" You know like this, that's a form I guess of a way of giving but it's not really giving. So...you try. You think like, ""Well when you're in a depressed mood sometimes I try to cheer you up and things like that. To me that's giving."" And doing little things like making sure the dishes are done and things like this when she's tired or sick or whatever or she's not home, and I think to me that's giving, that's sharing, that's being...but like she seems to want more. And like part of it I think she said something about, like sometimes you're tired and you shouldn't be, you should still be really willing to give and things like this. And like I don't know whether she means she thinks I should give up running and I should be home because she feels like talking at that time or it doesn't make any difference when she goes out four or five nights of the week, you know? [1:04:46.0]</p> Oh, okay. But I just can't understand that. Maybe it's just because I don't understand the word 'giving'. Maybe I don't know how to give...really give, and that really just is one thing that really bugs me.</p> Yeah. And I'm not really sure. I mean she did say one time that I didn't.</p> Yeah.</p> Yeah. Well she said like, well lately and like with the cleaning, and then one day I told this fellow I couldn't go out until lots later because I had to clean. I didn't feel, I even came out and told her. She said, ""Well that was the first time you ever thought of somebody like me. Not the first time but one of the first times you really thought of me first."" And I said, ""Look, I know you're going out tonight and you're going to bring people over. If you..."" If she wasn't bringing people over I couldn't see the sense of cleaning and then going out because you've got all day Sunday that you can do it...if nobody was coming over. But of course when somebody comes over you don't want the house to look a mess for somebody else and you care about them.</p> You know and so of course I said this, I said, ""Of course I thought of that. I mean that's stupid not to think of that."" But there are new things, like with my stepmother. You know when I went to see my real mother, I was out to see my stepmother and she lives...close to the hospital so. She said, she woke me up and she said, ""Do you want to go to the hospital to see your mother?"" I said, ""Yeah."" I said, ""You're coming too, aren't you?"" And I realized it's like, it really hit me because like now I don't think twice. It's just like, ""Of course this is my mother and I want to share my mother with my other mother because...like I, in fact I especially I wouldn't want you guys to sit at home here...by your self because dad's got to take me and Judah wants to go along. Naturally, I definitely want you to come."" But it's like at one time I wouldn't have asked, and if she had went along it would have been just because she was going along. You know and it was like, because I always wanted people to come to me...rather than taking the initiative sometimes and going to them. And I realized this, ""Holy cow!"" You know like it's something else.</p> Yeah. That I had never, I think I had learned it...because it's easy to come back now when I really want to. You know... </p> ...like they say, if you couldn't give when you were little you can never probably ever give. But...I was trying to explain this to her, like this is a new thing for me, it's going to take a while to constantly be thinking about what the other person needs and everything, because it's hard to do. It's a lot of hard work... </p> ...to be thinking about another person's needs all the time before yourself. So I said, ""Well, okay."" First I'm getting rid of my hangups and then, now I've got to get at the point where I'm...so it's hard... (both chuckling)</p> ...but it's coming I think. I hope. Thank you very much.</p> Same time, same station. (chuckling) [1:07:50.0]</p>",2
