<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh. So I don't know. I had kind of, not unusual work experiences, but (inaudible at 00:00:25) so last week I had this horrible meeting with Chet. And I can't think of a way to get him to make it stop. But anyway, I kind of ran different stuff and worked much longer. And at the end, kind of out of nowhere, he started actually saying that maybe some of the money that's going into technology is being spent stupidly, which he's never admitted before. [00:01:06 ]</p>

<p>I know. I was so confused. So (inaudible at 00:01:09) yes. Where are we going with it? And I had this brief really paranoid moment of, "Is he tried to trick me into saying something? No. Where would that get him?" But it was just really weird. And it's like I want to be a (inaudible at 00:01:28), but blah, blah, blah. I'm like, "Yeah I know. It does suck and it's pretty pointless." And I think part of it is that I ducked out of dealing with these stupid records that have surface tables that were coming in. So he had to deal with them. And it's not going well. One of the groups that wanted it are now really pissed because it's this big expensive table and it can't... It's basically an enormous iPad with legs.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:02:16]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it's probably the size of that couch.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. The table top is the size of that couch?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. That's big.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And whatever money they got to buy it, they're not giving anyone money to move it even though it requires movers. So one of the tech groups is like, "Fuck you. Now we don't want it because... what do you mean we have to pay to move it ourselves?" And they would have to find money in their budget to move, to rearrange all their furniture, etc., etc. So they're really pissed. And some other group is pissed about something else. So it's turning into a complete hugely expensive, it (inaudible at 00:03:07) really expensive (inaudible at 00:03:12) just exciting and (inaudible at 00:03:12) really good.</p>

<p>I just got my (inaudible at 00:03:17). It all sucks. It was a treat really weird. I sort of wanted to ask him why he was sharing this with me, but I was just pretty much overwhelmed. He also actually complimented me on something I'd done at work, three weeks ago, but... So I don't know why he was sounding like, "Oh by the way, that thing you did a month ago was great." But it was still nice to hear, even though... But the other thing which is sort of just more happening was just really enraging. Will...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry. Just hold on one minute. It looks like there's a little bit of crud on the chair or something. I don't know. Sorry.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't know if it's like somebody's hair or what. But I just wanted to wipe it. Does it need more wiping than this?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No it seems to be all off. [00:04:28]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry. I didn't notice until just then.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. I know, once you notice it's like... (laughing)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the second thing was...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will having it again. So he bought these touch screen computers, and he e-mailed Harry, the head of IT and (inaudible at 00:04:57) like, "Oh, where is that touch screen computer? I want it back to do something with it." And it's just been sitting in my office for, you know, four months. And so there's this flurry of like, "Where is it?" "It's in Felicia's office." "Why hasn't she brought it back to IT?" I'm like, "I didn't feel like it. I thought this would happen." And so I e-mailed him. And this was happening Thursday when I was at school, so I was Friday morning (inaudible at 00:05:24) like, oh. And so Will was like, "You know, find the time for me to bring it over to your office." Because he... He's having his office rekeyed at the building admin didn't have a key to it. So there's no way to get in there. Which is ... there's no other room in the entire building that's keyed like that. He just decided that he needed to do that, which is super irritating. [00:05:59]</p>

<p>And first he e-mailed me saying, asked if I'd come over between one and two today. Before I had a chance to say no, (inaudible at 00:06:09) said, "Is there any time on Monday that isn't between one and two?" I'm going, hmm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This is before noon or after 2:30 or something like that. He just came into my office and asked if I could move the computer now. Which it is. It was in the room and I was like, "Hmm, sure." And so I've been mostly avoiding dealing with him. It kind of reminds me how incredibly irritating he is to me. Like I always feel like it's very artificial. Like he's like a used car salesman. Like, super-artificial cheery, good morning. Like let's, "Pick up that computer." "Okay." It's really weirdly chipper and I feel like – I just find it strange. Because also it's also not like... It's not just that it's artificial, it's weirdly not pitched just like. I just wouldn't talk to another adult that way, probably.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you feel like it's really patronizing?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. It's sort of like how I might, how one might talk to like a teenager. Or like, kind of sometimes it's like I feel like when I was working at a fast food restaurant. The managers would always be very odd about it, like, "Alright, let's clean the grease buckets!" Okay. You can't really get excited about that. I think it's incredibly... I think it's just kind of insulting to pretend that it's going to be great, or to be like, "Let's go do that."[ 00:08:07]</p>

<p>So I brought the computer over, and he just continued with his weird, chipper artificiality. And you know, swept some things up. And he actually said "Okey-dokey" at the end. I was like, "What? Okay. I have to go." I mean... It's hard because everything he said just made me really angry. Like talking to him makes me really angry. I think because he's so weirdly patronizing and artificial about it. I'd be much happier if he was just neutral. I don't like his sort of... I think he thinks he's trying to be friendly, but it drives me completely crazy every time. [00:09:19]</p>

<p>And I try to, sort of... And part of it is my response is always bland, neutral, professional. Like, "Here is the computer." And then I set it up. And so I think that even makes it more jarring because usually people will somewhat match...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. He's not matching your tone at all.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it's true of like shorter interaction than longer interactions. He always stays in this weird, chipper car salesmany thing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You get a sense, what about it gets you so much?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think part of it is that I'm assuming he's being weirdly chipper and polite. I'm assuming because I made all these complaints. Except that like when I was actually in the HR office talking with him, he was incredibly rude and arrogant and obnoxious. So, like I... To me it's kind of like he's like, "Oh, I guess I should be nice to her, whatever." But not... Like he never acknowledged, apologized... Not even apologize, again even kind of acknowledge the existence, that the project went poorly or that he killed it, or any of that. So I feel like I've been coerced into being friendly to him, and I don't want to. [00:11:39]</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is there part of it that kind of sweeps under the rug what happened between you and he and that project?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And part of it is the way it kind of puts pressure on you to play nice?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think... now that I think of it, a big part of it definitely is the pressure to be nice which I really hate because I think it's unfair and we apply it towards women. Like you know, it's like walking on the street and randomly, if I'm not smiling everyone would be like, "You should smile. Why aren't you smiling?" And I'm like, "Fuck off." And walking down the street.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. [00:12:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in the workplace being a secretary and admin, part of that is this weird way you're forced to be... You're supposed to look friendly and welcoming at all times, which is kind of stressful. And also generally speaking, I feel like people comment more on women not being friendly than men. And then not being friendly, women are supposed to be friendly and cheery and whatever, and all these things. And Timothyie is... this is something that happened for a while, was super-chipper. And actually is it's kind of like very intensely chipper at all times. She's always trying to put a positive or smiling face on everything, which (pause). I mean, to me it's like, I'm like, a) that's really exhausting, and b) it's really... I find it hard to talk to her about projects or anything unless it's one on one. Because if we're in a group of more people, she seems to be under pressure to be super-positive. [00:14:05]</p>

<p>And even one on one she'll often be super... Like, "No, this is really great. This is so wonderful." And it's like, "Whatever. I don't care." I just wanted to know is this part of it working for you? You don't need to sell this to me, I just want to know about this part. Usually like, is the computer working, or do you know how to use this operator requesting, or what is it for? Just sort of those kinds of things. [00:14:41]</p>

<p>And I think the other thing is that I can't complain to IT I was really pissed that Will was really, like he just... He wouldn't answer my e-mail. So when he did he would be... He wouldn't give me the information I needed. He would only give it to the guys who are above me in the food chain, and he was kind of like, "Why aren't you running around and fetching for me?" And that really pissed me off. And I think eventually Harry, the head of IT, didn't want me working very much with Will because he was worried I wasn't positive enough about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Harry, the head of IT, didn't want you working with Will because he worried you weren't positive enough about working with Will? [00:15:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I might be rude to him. Actually not even that I might be rude to him, that I might be more like insufficiently deferential. Which, I don't know. He's a really weird... Timothy doesn't... never wants people to say no to Will and I'm okay saying to him, or at least saying to him, "That's not really possible. We need more lead time." Or I'd just let someone else make the decision. But Harry really didn't like it.</p>

<p>So I also kind of wonder if some of that got back to Will. I don't know. It's very... There's no real way to be like, "Can you stop being so (inaudible at 00:16:37) friendly, thanks." Especially since I've been complaining about him being so hostile. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is... One way to say is that he's kind of making like intrusive or inappropriate claims upon you? Like he can ask you to return the touch screen computer to him, no problem. But when he's encouraging you to be chipper or deferential like a little kid, or kind of subtly insisting that what happened before between you be forgotten, there he's kind of nudging or pushing you to kind of think, or feel, or react in certain ways to him. In a way that feels kind of intrusive. [00:18:08]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like it pretty strong feels like I don't... Like he's asking for more than what I would like. I feel like it's not enough that I do it, and I do it in a competent, professional way. He wants... It's like he wants emotional work out of me, that I don't want to give. And that generally speaking, I don't like to have to do... I don't like having to fake beyond like, I'm doing this. Doop, do do, do do. And be totally friendly, like brotherly friendly, whatever. And I feel so not, like it's not the job that I signed up for. [00:19:31]</p>

<p>And I do resent being pushed into it, especially by someone who I don't even work for. He's just this sort of annoying nemesis and in the reporting structure.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes me really angry is that, like I remember just how intensely upset and frustrated I felt toward the project, and I felt I didn't get any support from Chet and Karl. And while HR tried to be supportive, they were kind of stuck too. And it just like... It made me feel like I felt really just like alone and vulnerable because I don't have... Like, I'm the bottom of the (inaudible at 00:20:47), except for the student workers. So it felt really awful to sort of be there and be asking all these people for help and not getting any. And then when they did it was really weirdly backhanded. I never felt supported, even when I finally was. Being filmed and all that, I still didn't feel supported in what I was doing. I didn't feel like... I guess I felt like, I'm like I think that we have a right to do this and this is quite reasonable. And I felt like Karl and Will were like, "Oh..." That they felt blackmailed into, or bullied into me doing this. That I shouldn't have been doing it, I shouldn't have been there. Which also like... I was really torn because on the one hand it's not about me blackmailing you to tell that you're a complete idiot. But I'm like, well I'll probably get the outcome I want sort of, so do I really care? Does it really matter how I got there? And there's no way that I would get them to admit, like if they felt like they were being bullied or blackmailed, they would never admit it. So... (pause). [00:22:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I know like in addition to the, sort of, pressure being put on you to do a kind of a homework for him, now that just... It probably makes you angry. It reminds you of the whole video thing, and how alone and unsupported you were through all that. [00:23:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And it also, part of it was when I was walking over here I ran into... So the only person I had to speak to particularly about him, was this (inaudible at 00:23:48), who I tried for a couple of months to get an appointment with, kept getting pushed back, pushed back, pushed back and I just gave up. And when all this project was happening, HR was basically like, "Look, the only person above Will is Christy, and she's pretty high up and probably this isn't like... You're going up to a lot of levels to get to her to complain. A) She loves Will and B) she might reasonably feel like this is too small a nature or matter for me to deal with it. But mostly she thinks that Will can do no wrong." So I didn't really... I was torn because I felt like I didn't really feel safe saying to her, "You're golden boy sucks."</p>

<p>When I talk to him, what comes to mind again is like, I kind of want to talk to Christy about it. I want to tell her what happened. I want her to say something like, "Yeah. That was really awful." Or, "I didn't know." Something positive or affirming. But I don't know if she would and I don't know that this is the time to do it, et cetera. But I think about it a ton every time. [00:25:48]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I get it could be something that when you (inaudible at 00:25:57) where you've been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I did talk to one of the senior managers who had tried to... Had made some noises about me working under the (inaudible at 00:26:17) project, and I asked if I could speak to her afterwards, and I made an appointment to see her. And I sort of laid out what had happened, and she was like, "Oh. I had no idea. It's really awful. Blah, blah, blah. Of course we won't make you do this. So I get it." But it was also pretty clear that she didn't have any power to do anything beyond that. Like she could say, "That sucks," and that's it. [00:27:01] (pause)</p>

<p>So I did feel good after doing that. I mean, I'm still kind of frustrated, but it was nice to talk about it and have someone be like, "Yeah. That was crappy." But I don't know. The current head of HR blew me off when I tried to talk to her about it. So, and it's with so much Java people.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 00:27:29)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I mean, the universities are going through a re-orging and restructuring, et cetera. I don't know if it's... I sort of like, I don't know if it's worth doing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like, now might not be the time – kind of thing? [00:27:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like now might be the time, you know. Will or Christy could get re-orged out. So I don't know. But on the other hand, I just always intensely want to tell the two of them, that I don't do that, I think he's really incompetent and horrible to work with. I don't know. Like, he's gotten money again for a new project and it makes me really angry because, "You're just throwing money at him because you're like, "Oh, he's the technology guy."" But you don't know what he's doing. You never talk to any of the other... Any of the other librarians he works for about it, because they all hate him. It just feels so frustrating that money keeps getting thrown at him and it feels like there's absolutely no consequences to anything he does. [00:29:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think that's also exactly how it feels and part of what I think may enhance this train of thought in how he treats you. In other words, like he's sort of weirdly cheerful and patronizing and like nothing's ever happened between the two of you. And of course it's really annoying. And that, I think, you sort of feel like you have absolutely no leverage and he can do whatever he wants with impunity. And that's sort of makes your hurt and upset about it, like mushroom. [00:30:24]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean... (sighs) It's also... It's weird seeing... I think part of it, it's also when I get so upset, I get upset and angry, it feels very... It feels disconcerting and weird also if I'm just like, I don't know. There's not a lot of things I've gotten super-angry about in workplaces I work, and this one is still makes me still angry. Like, when I think about when I had to continue sharing a desk with this guy who was sexually harassing me, that made me angry and upset but part of what made me angry was that my manager was willing to, happy to let us move apart, but his manager didn't want us to because it would look bad. So it's like, I was pissed, but I wasn't pissed at my manager, I was pissed at another level up. And during that, I don't know, it was really difficult, really hard in a lot of ways. But (inaudible at 00:32:07) I'm not super-angry about it anymore. [00:32:11]</p>

<p>When I think of another, another work thing was just like I think that was when they tried to get me to work over weekend with no pay and I refused, so I had to go to mitigation. I was furious when it first happened, but relatively quickly I went from being super-angry to being like, "Well fine, fuck you. I'm going to show this to (inaudible at 00:32:44) and bring you that maybe this is going a be a real big pain." And I felt more outraged and "this is pretty unethical," than angry. Because you're not angry from the part we went down I was just like, "Fuck you." And this is just like staying really angry. [00:33:14]</p>

<p>And, I mean, I tried talking about it with Chet and his response was pretty much, "You don't understand." And he was very literally, "You don't understand how much effort goes in to make sure that you don't have to deal with him." And I don't really care how much effort he got to go through because he was doing what he was supposed to be doing. And (inaudible at 00:33:46). Like, it's him trying to get my approval or something. For me that ... I'm sorry you have to do your job as a manager, it's difficult for you. [00:34:07]</p>

<p>Angry and all. And he still won't really, he doesn't want to acknowledge that... I get to be able to get him to say that Will ever did anything wrong with that project. I mean, I saw that thing for a while, but when it comes to that, Chet always has a sort of ... Like he has a lot of, "Well, but this, but that. I worked really hard on it too." (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: He kind of evades actually dealing with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like he needs to do the motions and wants me to come to his direction. [00:35:05] (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess the thing is like really having nowhere to go with it, or no way of getting any traction on it is part of what makes this stick around the way it does.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And sort of, like I would really love advice from a coworker on; is it a really bad idea to talk to Christy ? Is it a good idea? And haven't been able to really get that. Like I've talked about it with people and they're like, "Oh, Karl's so particular." Et cetera. And then I'm like, "Well you think I should go to Christy? Would it be bad or would it be neutral?" I don't really get... And what I want is for them to be like, "Well, you know, she probably is not going to... She's probably really busy, it's not going to go anywhere." Or they can say, "No, you should totally go do it. I'm sure she'll be open to the conversation." But I don't know if I really get that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. (pause) Do you have any sense why not? [00:37:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, not really. I think part of it is the people that I've talked to are the (inaudible at 00:37:17) who actually report to him. And so they are already frustrated and feel like... At first I felt that I had to know them before I talk to Christy, but they feel like... Their response is like, "Well he's such a golden boy, blah, blah, blah." But it's not really a, "You probably shouldn't do that because he's the golden boy." You see what I mean? And I think a lot of other people are super-frustrated and they're... She just isn't around a lot. [00:38:14]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I wonder if you had said something more like, "I just wish I could have a half an hour with Christy where she would really see what we're talking about, we could probably do something about it." That's not... I'm not making a suggestion on what you do, but I am kind of teasing out where they're coming from. They might get a little more onboard with something like that. In other words, they would share your frustrations about how to deal with him. And wishing she would do something about him. If not being able to answer the question of like, (inaudible at 00:39:03).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Like, "I'll get back with Dave, but he's frustrated with (inaudible at 00:39:09) saying something like, "I wish she would think about it. I really wish that she would, whatever." But as far as I can tell, no one's done that. As far as I know, no one's that. Lots of people are pissed. Does this mean just no one has done it, or does it mean this is the worst idea ever? And I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (laughter) Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I really am just saying, (inaudible at 00:39:42) and I generally... I have had way more positive interactions with Christy than a lot of the people. Some people find her, like frustrated or annoyed by her and find that she's... I don't know. I really don't know why people are annoyed with her. I haven't totally figured it out. I get along fine with her, like when I'm in the meeting or chatting. But sometimes the library staff just don't like her. And I don't... I think it's because she very critically favors Will , but I don't know. I haven't really figured that part out. [00:40:35]</p>

<p>I feel like, well I did meetings with her, I planned (inaudible at 00:40:37) with her. I feel like I'm kind of like, "Well it seems to me like she would be open to that conversation if I said..."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So why haven't I maybe had it with her? [00:40:52]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Then I'm like, "Am I just getting... Am I just not seeing what's really going on? I could not be savvy enough?" And then also, when I spend all this time trying to meet with her and failing, part of me is like, "Was that just a subtle "Go away?"" Yeah. Because the sixth time I had to be rescheduled I was kind of like, "I think I can take a hint, or she's really busy." I couldn't get her secretary to say either way. Because sometimes someone will be like...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. [00:41:37]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like I definitely heard there were lots of them, especially if they know the secretary, for other times they'd be like, "So is this person avoiding me, or are they really busy? Should I just not even try?" Like, what's going on with this kind of meeting. Sometimes she'll be like, "Ah, it's pretty much a dead subject." I'm like, Okay, right. But she just really wouldn't say, which also made me a little nervous. [00:42:04]</p>

<p>So again I'm like, "Do you not know?" Like it just gets so I feel like I'm overanalyzing everything and that, the library that (inaudible at 00:42:20) is based on someone fetching. And it could be all in my head, or not. And I don't know. I feel like I just don't know. Or maybe that I don't want to know, like gaps.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's just pretty (inaudible at 00:42:42).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And a big part of it is also that I feel like the people who normally would be helping me out in this, who would be Chet and Karl, but they're so useless that I can't get any... (sighs) They're really useless. I just can't get anything from them. (long pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here's one thing that's occurred to me is how much you think you get caught up in it because you feel really shitty about it. And surprisingly, it makes you pretty compelled to think about what you can do and kind of the cocky part of that. Or if it's because you really do want to do something about it and you get stuck somewhere further along the line, if that makes sense. [00:44:41]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I'm not really sure. I think it's kind of both. I think part of me feeling just really crappy about the whole thing is that, (sighs), I don't know. Sometimes I think like well should I press upward at the time. But then I'm like, no I went to HR a lot and they really couldn't do anything. And I talked to (inaudible at 00:45:27). So I don't know. A part of me thinks; well is there something else I could... Is there someone else who could have helped, who would have let me go talk to ...?" And I think the answer is probably no. But I still have this; well maybe if I had talked to her, or maybe if I talked to you, someone else would have been able to – I don't know – make it a less crappy project. [00:46:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think we're going to stop for now.</p>
