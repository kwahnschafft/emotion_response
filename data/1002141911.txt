<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: My name is Kristine.  I'm a marriage and family therapist.  I work with children, I work teens, I work with children.  I work primarily with domestic violence.  And I live in California and we're here working with Catholic Charities on a new project that deals with trauma, which we're going to talk about.  Cliff here is a psychologist, he's a doctor.  And he'll tell you a little bit about what he does.  And we're just going to sit here for about an hour or two and talk and share ideas.  And we're going to look at this piece of paper that we gave you and hopefully have some fun.	</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Okay.  Let me see what else I want to say.  My name is Cliff and I am a psychologist in Princeton.  I work and live in Princeton.  I used to live in California.  Then they had a big earthquake and I said, I'm out of here.  So, there's a reason why you guys are here and not somebody else.  There's a very important reason.  This is the third meeting today we've had and this is the first one with teenagers and with people who have experience with what it is we're trying to learn about.  And what we're trying to learn about is exactly what you just said, which is trauma.  Every single person that's in this room right now, including myself I would say, but especially you guys have been, have experienced traumas in their life.  Traumas are events that happen that can affect you in negative ways.  They don't necessarily have to affect you in a negative way, but there are things which challenge a person to be able to keep going.  The quality of being able to have bad things happen to you in your life and still be able to keep going is called resilience.  And that's what's on the board there, bouncing back.  Some people have one or two big traumas in their life, some people have many traumas in their life.  You would expect that the people that have the most traumas in their life are the ones that don't survive as well.  But it's not always true.  In fact, some of the people that have the most traumas in their life are the people that survive the best and become the most successful people.  And that's a very interesting thing.  So the question is, you know, who knows best about what helps a person survive and keep going in life.  The problem with most of the past studies and research is that it's mostly just people in universities making up all kinds of interesting theories.  But hardly anybody has been asking you guys how did you survive.  Hardly anybody has asked you guys what specifically is it about you that may have helped you to keep going when other people gave up.  Sometimes people give up because they get depressed.  Sometimes people give up because they just can't handle.  Sometimes people kill themselves.  Some people just get killed, you know.  That just happens.  Some people lose their mother.  My kids lost, I've lost my wife.  She died of Bone cancer.  I have three teenage sons.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Some people lose their sisters.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Oh, some people lose their sisters.  I see what you're saying.  That's correct.  All of those things are undeniably bad things.  They're undeniably difficult hardships.  The question is, why do people bounce back and how do they bounce back?  What is it about them?  What is it about each of you that helps you to keep going?	Is it because of who you know?  Is it because of who you are?  Is it because of certain kinds of strengths you have?  One thing we do know it isn't always the strongest person.  It isn't always the physically strongest person that survives.  Just like on the football field or basketball, it's not always the tallest guy, it's not always even the most accurate player that is the best player.  There's something else about those people that makes them as good as they are.  So, that's why we're here and that's why we're asking you and that's what makes you guys special.  So I'm very respectful of the fact that you came and I appreciate you coming and I hope that you'll take this as serious as you can because it's very important.  What we're trying to do here is develop a questionnaire that is not useless, that actually can be used by social workers and psychologists and teachers and foster care folks and other people that actually is useful and not just another piece of paper.  So it's kind of interesting to have, what we call, an instrument or a test where we actually ask the kids themselves what would be a good question to ask to get to know who I am and what's important to me to know.  Do you guys understand what I'm saying so far or no?  All right.  Now, because this room and this meeting is called a focus group.  Focus is kind of like an organized approach to finding out something.  And it's done in an organized way.  Not too, too organized, but in a way we've got to sort of be consistent so that we go and have another meeting in Chicago tomorrow, have another meeting in Miami the next day.  It will basically be the same kind of meeting, otherwise maybe it's not going to be as bad.  So, I'm going to ask you questions.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: I got one question.  When you say who you are, one of the things that's different about this is we don't want to know what's wrong with you, we want to know what's right with you.  We want to know what you think is a good quality about you, maybe even one of the qualities that helps you to be a good survivor.  Maybe it helps, maybe it doesn't.  But the point is, you probably know a few good things about yourself that you consider to be one of your better qualities.  And I'm not just talking about intelligence.  You know, sometimes there's different kinds of intelligence, right?  Like, knowing what's going on, like being able to—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Like street smarts.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: There's a different kind of intelligence, right?  Street smarts.  But there are other qualities like being patient, being determined, never giving up.  There are tons of different qualities.  As a matter of fact, just throw out a couple of qualities so we know what we're talking about.  Not necessarily about yourself, but about other people.  What are some good qualities that are good to have?  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Determination.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Willing.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Willing?  Being open, rather than close-minded.  That's a good quality.  What else?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Good speaker.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Good speaker.  Being able to express yourself and have good skills, language skills, to verbalize what it is you're trying to say.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Good listener.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It would be if you could adapt to different situations.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Perfect.  Adapting to environments rather than having everything the same way everywhere else you go.  That's a very good quality.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I have discipline, for myself.  You know, I refuse to be a quitter. I can't stand to fail.  If I fail, I'd just drop out of school.  That's one thing I'm afraid of.  So, actually what I mean by that is just not being behind.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Compassion.
	
A:	One of my good qualities is, like, I don't mind being around certain people and I don't mind being in different situations.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Be mentally strong and physically strong.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: I agree with you.  What do you mean mentally strong?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Like, if you get hit, if you put in your mind to get back up, you're going to get back up.  But if you say, oh, I'm hurt, I can't move.  You're going to stay that way.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: What I can say about me is, the good part about me is how to understand and never give up whatever challenge I face.  I've been through a lot of things.  I'm first new in this country.  And when I first came here a lot of people talked to me, what are you talking about?  They didn't understand how I talk to them.  And through all this I never give up on whatever challenge I face, you know.  I'm not in this country for three years.  I'm from Sudan, Africa.  So I go here from high school last year and it's because I have confidence in what I'm bringing, you know.  That's what [WORD] came out from that challenge.  So I never give up.  And that's the important key.  Don't give up whatever you pass, you know.  So I can say that's a good thing about me.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Can you say a little bit more by what you mean by understanding?  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's basically like, let me put it this way.  People talk like, they see it different in people, not the same.  A lot of people see it different in people.  In other words, like, I'm from Africa and they're treating me like I'm not from this country.  So African country and what they say is a lot of people see different, but they don't see larger.  We are all human beings and that's the key thing.  So I don't give up.  When they say, whatever bad thing they say about me, or good thing they say about me, I treat it like one thing.  So if I see different, like, my brother mentioned before, like, let's say, he don't like being failing whatever test he did.  So if I have that feeling, that mean I would lose my confidence and I would go back from what I face, you know.  So having confidence in what you're doing is what make you go through all this.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: What he say, I think it's like, if a person every been through anything in their life, they should be confident.  They shouldn't, like if they fall or stumble somewhere along the way, or get into their future they shouldn't go back to the past and say, well, look what I've done in the past because the past is only bringing you back to the past and if you try to get to the future, there's no way, if you keep looking at all the bad things that happen to you.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: You're saying that you tend to be oriented to the future, not to the past.  If something bad happened in your past, you don't have your mind dwelling and staying there, you got your mind up here about what's here and what you want up here, not what happened to you back here.  Can anybody else relate to that?  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Mine is sort of indifferent.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: What do you mean?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Say, a lot of things, you know, I have my sister that died and my grandma died on Christmas Eve.  So I think about the future, but you know, I go back to think about the good memories that keep me going on in the future.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: So, I'm just repeating you, but I want to make sure that you think I heard you, because it's important what you're saying.  You're saying, well, the truth is, at least for you, you're not just have your mind in the future.  There are things in the past, even though there is pain and there are problems and there's losses in your past, you still at times go back to the past for the good memories, because that's important to you as well.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's my shadow.  That's what builds me up and that's what makes me who I am.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: That's good, that's good.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: So, you get strength from that?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, I don't mean to talk too much, but I mean, I'm not saying that it's all bad to think about the past because my mom died when I was five.  And it's still Times that I think about my mom, you know, the memories she had of me laughing and laying on the couch and all this stuff.  But the thing about it is I get don't stuck on it because if I get stuck on it and I just keep into myself, why did my mom have to die?  Why did she leave?  Why did she do this?  Why did she do that?  And that's not going to get me nowhere.  It's good to think about the memories, but you can't stay stuck on all the good memories because sooner or later you're gonna say, why did God do this, or why did this happen?  And you're going to get stuck.  And at one point you're just not going to be able to push forward for what you want for yourself.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Yeah.  Say your name, please.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Okay.  My name's Edward.  My dad died when I was five.  And I can understand what she's saying.  Like, I was going through stuff like that.  I was, like, always thinking about, I mean, why did he have to die and all this stuff?  I used to do bad in school just because, like, thinking about my dad all the Time.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Being distracted by the feelings and by the thoughts of it?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But I'm over it though. Once I just sit down and think about stuff or I can figure out stuff, I just thought about it.  Like, people just kind of go someTimes.  You know, everybody gotta go.  It's just their Time.</p>

<p>
A:	I'm sorry.  I give myself an explanation of, like, I don't ever, well, at first when I was little I didn't understand why my mom died.  As I got older I just gave myself the explanation that everything happens for a reason.  And I believed it and, you know, that's the way I was taught from, like, when I was little.  And every foster home that I've been in they believe that God makes things happen for a home.  I really, now I don't even wonder why my mom died because, I mean, sooner or later.  You know, if I go to Heaven or whatever I'll understand why I did when I'm dead. </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Well, I wanted to say that my dad died when I was a little kid and my grandma and my family, they just tried to tell me that it's in the past, don't look back in the past.  Look, well look where I am, look at where I'm going to be when I grow up.  They just built me up.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I'm not saying that, you know, but, when I had, I was in trouble at school, I was fighting, I would sit in the corner and wish I would die and stuff like that.  Not wanting to put any physical harm to myself, but I would think that.  So one day I got into a fight, went up to the principal office and my principal sat me down and told me to look at it this way.  My sister died under the age of 12.  She got me an inscription.  Said if a child dies up under the age of 12, she, they're still on their parent's saying.  So, I already know that my sister is in Heaven and I gotta make it there to see her again.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I'm Drayton.  From the same country, Sudan.  So I, you know, when I was 12, my dad got killed in the war.  At that Time I was very depressed.  And it's just me alone because my mom just give birth to me, then no child again.  So we stay like that.  And then when he got killed it was just me and mom the way we were.  We were in bad condition.  Everything we do, you know, we pay the bills, we do everything.  Because I was in school I couldn't really do a lot of, make a lot of money.  So we were really in bad condition.  But that was really strong.  So it just made us come here, you know.  We were living there and I had an uncle who we stayed together.  In Kenya, you know, my mom got a job and uncle got a job.  So we had little power.  Then at that Time I went to school and I'm trying to think about my dad, say if he was here it would have been do this.  But Mom told me that you could not do that because if he was still thinking, you're not going to do what he's supposed to, like, at school.  I say, okay.  Yeah.  At that Time I just, you know, I say, okay, I'm not going to school here, I'm going to go to AmTima to get a good education.  I came here and I went to St. Anne's High School.  Doing better.  Making good grades.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: My name Julie and my mother helped me get through lots of hard Times.  Because my granddaddy he died when I was six or five.  And he stood, like, give me anything I want.  So when he died then I had stopped for that kind of thing.  But mostly I think back and I cry someTimes about it.  But my momma tells me that when somebody dies then it was their Time to go to Heaven or Hell.  But I've got to be the one to make a good decision so I can go to Heaven and see my grandfather again.</p>


<p>ANN LARKIN: I have a couple of things to say, as far as relating to what this young man said a minute ago as far as his mother died when he was five.  All right.  My mother passed in 2001.  I really didn't know her that well, but I knew her well enough to know that, you know, she loved me.  Okay, and how I dealt with it, you know, a lot of people used to talk to me and still a lot of people talk to me, you know, they're telling me, you know, I'm sorry to hear that, but stuff happens.  So I look at that because that has made me a stronger young man as far as what I used to be.  Because now I have to mature, even though I wasn't with her, that's still my mom.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I really like the point that these two made up, what's your name?  Caine and Drayton.  I like the point that they made up because a lot of people, I don't think, I mean not everybody in AmTima, but I think a lot of people don't understand that living in AmTima is so good, because, like, living other places that people are less fortunate, I mean, people in AmTima don't take that very seriously, I don't think.  And I just think that, they all come to AmTima and it's, like, thank God, you know what I'm saying.  But then again that they have their li—.  I mean, what we're going through is not things that they are going through because, you know, like, AmTima, we read stories about different people, no disrespect, we read different stories from different countries and places in Africa and they are going through torture.  I mean, serious torture.  And we are not.  I mean, we go through the things of mom, dad.  We're not going through the torture that they go through.  So I think many of us need to take the Time-out to just thank God and realize that even though we've got our trauma that we are blessed.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: That's a good point.  Some people call it having a sense of appreciation, and a sense of perspective about things.  As bad as you think it is for yourself, it could be worse.  It always could be worse.  And that kind of helps us to keep going and to be strong.  Is that a, by the way, a true statement for both of you?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah.  Basically, you know, I've been, it's now 15 years I never seen my father.  I never heard if he's alive or dead.  And it's because of war that's going on in my country.  So, like Edward mentioned before, you can't forget, I mean, whatever shall on you pass, don't give up.  I mean, we are rooting for you.  You can't stop because something happen in your family, you lose your mom, you lose your dad and you discontinue your independence because of, that you lose somebody.  We have a reason for it, you know.  </p>

<p>
JOSH LOMAN:	Can I say something?  You guys are smart, but you're also funny.  And I wonder if someTimes keeping a good sense of humor is important too to get through life and to get through challenge and trouble, you better have a good sense of humor.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Crying heals you from the inside.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I use my sense of humor for little kidding stuff, like, when people talk about me I just make a joke out of it.  And someTimes people don't get it.  Like, when they talk about me and I make a joke about myself and laugh with them, they don't really get them.  But that's just my way of doing something.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: A lot of people put up a front, too.  A lot will laugh in front of you, and then go home and cry.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I don't do that.  I can honestly say I don't do that.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: So are you saying it's important to be able to have thick skin and not let that get to you?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Oh, of course.  No one gives me a roast.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I get along with everybody, it's just I don't take a lot of mess off anybody.  And if somebody says something to me, I'm going to tell them how I feel.  But someTimes it ends up in a fight and someTimes it doesn't.  Most of the Time it ends up in a fight because they want to get smart with me and I don't like that.  So, but, you're laughing.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I don't care who they are, if they're white, Chinese, Mexican.  If you want to say something to me and I try to talk it out with me and you want to get smart with me, then we're fighting.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: How do you know where to draw the line of that's okay, that doesn't affect me or I'm not going to let it affect me and that's it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Before I got involved with Catholic Charities I used, I wouldn't care, I dropped my backpack and throw down in the hallways, I wouldn't care.  But I had this lady that helped me, my counselor to understand that you can't go off fighting everybody or anybody who comes your way or looks at you wrong.  Because used to, you looked at me wrong, I was about to whoop your booty.  [LAUGHTER]  But now I've gotten to where I kind of—.</p>

<p>[TAPE SIDE CHANGE]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: She just educated you, are you saying that something made sense to you?  What made sense about that?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: The fact that she said, there's always going to be somebody that doesn't like you or you're different from them, but you're just going to have to laugh about it and let it go over your head or whatever, just ignore it.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: What you choose to do with your energy.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: She said that I think I'm cool when I'm whooping people's butt or fighting somebody.  But there's going to be one Time that I get my butt whooped, and I'm going to admit, I did get my butt whooped one Time really good.  But I had six people on me, so.  But, you know, she said you've just got to let, ignore them and don't be afraid to walk away from a fight because I used to wouldn't walk away from a fight but now I'll walk away from one, even though I wish I would have pounded her face.  I'll walk away from one.  I mean, that's just me.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: How do you get over the hot feeling you have inside when you walk away from a fight?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I either punch something or I'll start going off on some, not on somebody, I'll just go off.  I speak my mind and I tell how I feel.  So I can start screaming at somebody.  And someTimes it will be my daddy or whoever comes my way.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I can really relate with Lucy because I'm the same way.  But ever since third grade I was real bad.  But I've been going to church a lot.  It had changed a lot.  But I was just like her.  Somebody just look me wrong, I just about to bust a head open.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: What was it about going to church that may have helped change you?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's like, I'm reading the Bible.  People talk to me, like the spiritual stuff.  I didn't want to join a gang.  I'm not going to join a gang.  About 15 guys want to jump on me.  And, like, seeing my brother get shot and all that stuff, like, I just think about it.  Like seeing, like, you're going to pay.  No matter, like, if you're seeing like today, you don't want to pay for it tomorrow, they're going to come back and get you.  It just changed me a lot.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I had something to say about what he had said, but I'm so sorry about what he had said.  I change, I challenge, I take that out and I draw, I play football, I play basketball.  I hang around friends that will keep me from not going off and doing something.  And the same thing here.  When I was there, I fought, I fought, fought, fought.  This leader of a gang, he came up to me.  He told me that him and 25 of his friends were going to jump me if I didn't join a gang.  I fought all 25 of them.  And there's one dude knocked me straight out.  And I joined the gang.  And after that I find out that the only way out of a gang is through death.  So I died in Christ.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Hmm. </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Lamont speaking.  Coming up as a young man, I mean, I had, I mean, someTimes I still do have a lot of anger inside.  But, you know, I don't let it show.  You know, I used to fight all the Time.  Every day at school, I mean, I used to fight.  Actually, it was something, you know what I'm saying, when I was mad when I fought that was fun to me because, you know, beating a person up, I had the adrenaline and rush just there with you.  And when you get through fighting it's gone.  You don't feel, then you feel sorry.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You're not the first.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But see, what happened was I was in the sixth grade and a guy, he didn't get the best of them.  You know, he got the last lick and I hated it.  You know, if you got the last lick, we've got to fight again.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Because you don't like to lose.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I don't like to lose.  So, my partner Tim, we're best friends still to this day.  He came up to me, he said, it's just the last lick.  So we went to church that Wednesday.  And I guess the sermon was directed towards me.  The guy was talking about violence.  And there was some sermon that opened up my eyes and instead of fighting the guy, I went up to him, I shook his hand, I said, nice fight.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: You're telling me that that sermon touched you in such a way that it changed you from wanting to get the last lick to one of—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It changed my whole outcome of the situation.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: That's powerful.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: The next Time I would see the guy, if I wouldn't have heard this sermon, it was going to be 4:30.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I mean, the Bible does that.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Why? </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: There are words in there that express what you feel and what you think and what's going on around you.  Like, certain passage.  The words you say and do.  But through Jesus Christ that the gift of God is eternal life.  If you believe in Heaven and you believe that you can start over, because it tells you that.  Once you say you start over fresh, and once some, the preacher gets up there and he preaches, he preaches true to life things I think it's going on around us right now.  If it gets inside you, you listen and not sleep.  And you can, it goes through your head, it's going to stick like a match strike on gas.  It lights.  And it's a feeling that's inside of you.  And that feeling will never leave if you keep it in there. </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: If I had asked you a question in the questionnaire, like have you ever had a spiritual experience, would you have known to say, yes?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yes.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Based on what you just said about being moved that way.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I would put two checks.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: You'd put two checks.  Cool.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: There's a bunch of changed.  This year I'm going to a home school group and the two, my principal and my teachers' kids have mental disabilities.  And don't nobody want their kids around and I love kids.  And don't nobody want their kids around somebody who is getting in trouble all the Time, fighting, talking about whooping somebody's butt or running away or, you know, whatever.  Thinking they're bad.  There's nobody that wants their kids around that type of person.  And I like to be around her kids and I feel like, you know, they like to be around me.  But, you know, they wouldn't want me around their kids if I was still acting the way I did last year and that's mainly what, and being around those two kids, seeing that I'm much more fortunate than they are, one's got autism and one's got Down's Syndrome.  You know, I have the capability to do things.  You know, she's six years old.  She can't even talk yet.  And the other one's four.  She just learned how to talk.  I talk like that, not even nothing.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: If I called that, what you just said, a sense of responsibility, getting a sense of responsibility once you came to that point that you were talking about of getting to the age where you understand, hey, I'm responsible.  I have these two kids here and I can't be all crazy and wild and emotionally out of control, that you would, is that reason why you're saying it, a sense of responsibility for others?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: And the friends that I would like to keep do not like somebody who's, or does not want to be around somebody who's always talking about fighting or getting into trouble all the Time.  But then I do have friends that are constantly telling to me to fight, but then I just turn and think about her teacher and her kids and, you know, my friend that does care what happens to me.  Because usually my mom's telling me to go whoop their butt or something.  But if I turn to my dad and my friends, first of all, my dad would probably put me in jail if I do something, you know, anymore.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Ben, is that what you meant by going to friends that are not going to encourage the bad behavior but are more positive.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Like they can relate to what you're saying and they know what you're going through because you talk to them.  You're a friend.  They're very close to you.  So, they're going to try to keep you because they know you're struggling. </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Tell me if this sounds to pessimistic, but, by the way, that's another term.  Are you opTimistic, or are you pessimistic.  You know, they say that people who survive hardship and trauma are people who are opTimistic people.  And people who are pessimistic and negative don't survive as well.  How come, I always thought that if you go to these other friends they would be considered too goody-goodies.  You know, like, little perfect angels and the other kids would be considered more normal.  The ones that would want you to fight and act out and stuff like that.  So, are you saying there is such a thing as having friends that are positive but they don't necessarily have to be nerds and don't have to be, they can still be like you, you can still relate to them.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: In this day and age, you've got three sets.  You've got the good, you've got the middle and you've got the evil.  If you hang around evil then you're going to fight, you're going to get in trouble.  You hang around the middle, it's someTimes cool to just let it all.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: To goof off.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Just laugh or something.  Brush it off.  Because then they're going to look at you and they're going to be, like, that doesn't even affect that person.  Then they're going to think, how does that look on me to be bothering that person, that person's stronger than me and they want to build their self up to be like you.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Exactly.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I had two things to say, what she said about the disabled children.  It's not a belief that I was taught, but I think that you could learn something.  I think that a person can learn something from a child that's disabled or whatever.  And to break up the fact again that you should, that you are capable of knowing what to do and adapt to different situations, that they can't.  And another thing that I want to bring up was, like, I haven't gotten into a fight in a long Time, so I'm considering this the new me.  I never did understand, like, when I came home and if I had a problem, somebody that was messing with me, when I came home, I never understood it from my mom, from the foster parents, I have never understood why.  But when you're coming into a problem, like, somebody messing with you and they want to fight you, they either tell you, go tell the principal or they tell you, don't worry about it or they tell you to talk it out.  I have never got that because I've tried all three and it's resulted in fighting.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But if you don't do anything about it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: The only thing that has worked for me was just changing myself completely.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Inside yourself.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah.  And making sure that I don't disrespect them or insult them and if I did it anyway, for them to tell me so I can apologize.  But I just never understood those three things and when I do those three things, normally it results in a fight.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: They still don't do anything about what?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: They still don't do anything about the problem.  They'll just, like, forget about it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Just push it off.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: They still don't do anything and when you do fight then they want you to suspend you, get you into detention—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Expel you.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, expel you, do whatever they can do, get you screwed.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Okay, excuse me.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But, I mean, that's what I'm saying.  Because if you go tell the teacher, first of all, no child or no kid our age like to be called a snitch or a tattle-tale.  You don't like to be called that.  That's going to make you made when you go tell and they call you that.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: But don't you have to still solve the problem?  Because isn't that problem still going to be bothering you?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But like I say, you tell your parent, see, when I tell my parents about something, they won't never forget.  But other parents, someTimes they'll forget then the kids, their kids will forget and then they're perfect.  Because someTimes you have to fight, like, there's a boy messing with you, or a girl messing with you for, like, three or five days and then he come and just try and ignore them.  And then they'll just keep on talking about you and then you're like, that's it.  You'll just turn around and hit them or do whatever you can do to get them off your back.  You know, fight.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: We'll listen to what you're going to say and then we have two choices.  We've actually used a lot of the Time.  We only have about 45 minutes left.  So we can keep going.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: This is good talk, by the way, thank you.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: And just plow right through and then you guys can get out of here, or we can take a little break, but we have to take a little break and come right back.  What do you want to do?</p>

<p>ALL:	Break.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: All right, let's take a short break.  Five minutes to go to the bathroom, drink some water, do what you've got to do, do some jumping jacks, come back here in five minutes.</p>

<p>[BREAK]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: While you're here I want to ask you a quick question.  Could you answer this question if it was asked to you, how are you feeling today, awful, poor, average, good, outstanding.  Would you be able to answer that?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I feel average, like I always feel.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I feel outstanding.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Every day?  You could answer that one.  I have a talent or an ability of which I am proud, yes, somewhat, no.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Football, basketball, art.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: See, I don't see why we couldn't just get a, do some of this.  Are there any questions here, that if you look through you go, oh, that's a stupid question.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Aha, I tell you.  I got a little check by those.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: All right, tell me.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I can't find it.  Well, this wouldn't be a stupid question, but to me it would be.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Which one?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Asking me about committing suicide.  I had one that I was just, like, what?  But I can't find it right now.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: There's two about running away that don't make sense to me.  You've always asked me if you ran away, and then there's another one that asks something else about running away.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: They keep on asking the same question.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I would never hurt an animal even if I was upset.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Well, some people do.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: What are you going to do with an animal, man?</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Sure, some people—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: A poor little puppy or something.  That's wild.</p>

<p>[EXTRANEOUS, AND OVERLAPPING CONVERSATIONS WHILE PANEL RETURNS FROM BREAK]</p>

<p> 	JOSH LOMAN:	Kind of fits what he was saying, right, you've got to decide which group you're going to associate with.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Now it's cool to stay in school, in a way.  Because the people that used to get in trouble now, they're now settled down and you're fighting, they're like, man, what's wrong with you?  No, because I used to love fighting, you know, just getting all the anger out, because people were bothering me.  They would push me, pick on me on the bus.  And when I had to defend myself, I had to defend myself.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I used to fight because I thought people thought I was cool.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I used to fight and if I won I could talk about it to everybody.  Everybody just come up to you.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's boring now.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: They talk bad about girls that can fight really good.  They'll sit there and call them a boy or they'll call them a tomboy.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: A Sumo wrestler.  I'm just like—.  I'm not no man.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: They can call me what they want to call me, I don't care.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I don't talk about nobody behind their back.  I say what I have to say.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: That's what I'm talking about.  You can describe me, even someTimes.  I don't know how many Times.  The only thing about me I can't find nobody that I can relate to.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: They say if I fight with that man or that, then I'm going to pay the price.  [UNINTELLIGIBLE, UNDER BACKGROUND DIALOGUES]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Power or dominated to win something?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Will you say something, because I really like to hear you talk.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Oh, my God.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I like your accent.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: When you talk, I'll be sitting there going—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I like that accent, I swear.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You know, I like the way Lamont talks because he talks slow.  But it's funny.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Yeah, he reminds me of a comedian, I don't know who, but somebody.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I like to going to Christmas parties because Lamont get on the microphone and everybody start laughing.  Funny.  </p>

<p>[CONTINUED EXTRANEOUS CONVERSATIONS]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: We have a lot of stuff to get through in a really short Time, so we're going to try to stay focused.  So if I cut people off or if I don't get to everybody it's only because we have a lot of stuff to ask your opinions about.  So, sorry for that.  And we're going to dive right in.  We're going to get a little focused on asking some specific questions.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Specific questions so you can give us specific answers.  Okay, where do you want to start?  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: One.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Okay, so let's start with that.  When one of my friends come to me to tell me he or she has had something bad happen to them, I usually start by, what?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: By listening.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Encourage.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Try to give them positive feedback.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Good.  Listening and positive feedback.  What else?  When a friend comes to tell you something he or she has had something bad happen to them, I usually start by what?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I'll usually my friend I'll whoop somebody's butt for them.  [LAUGHS]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: What else, we want to know whatever you would say.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I can say something funny.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Make light of it?  Try to get them to lighten up?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: What I do is, like, I go somewhere like in a cafeteria, because that's where everybody would be.  And then I'll find a table where nobody's sitting, just me and her, me and him, or whoever.  And then we'll talk about it and then I'll start making them laugh.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Why the cafeteria?  For the privacy or for the food or what?  [LAUGHTER]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Everybody's going to be in the cafeteria eating something.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Right.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: And that's why.  And it'll be noisy and all this.  And what's the use you going somewhere quiet where everybody can put their ear on the door and listen what you're talking about.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: In the open wide you at least know somebody's going to listen to what you're saying.  And it might have a positive feedback for what you're saying to that person.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Or you can be outside.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I've got a question about this paper.  It asked me what grade I'm in and I'm in four different grades.  I home school.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Write that down.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Any other response?  Let's just go on.  What do you do when you've had a bad experience, one that makes a big impact on you?  For example, if you see a fight between two people and one gets badly hurt, how do you deal with that?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I would jump in.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Hey, I have a question.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: There are different kinds of ways that people can hurt.  They can get hurt physically and they can get their feelings hurt.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: One way, you get into a fight and you get beat real bad and it's a fight that you know you could have won, it'll hurt you mentally too because then you might not fight anymore.  And that's not a positive, well, it is a positive thing.  But it's not positive for you because you'll always be bound by that fight and you'll be scared to ever fight again.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I've got something to say, like to add on today.  If you get in a fight and you get beat up, then I mean I think it's not a good thing for you to fight anyway, because if you get beat up you're going to say, oh, you're down, you're hurt and that might be how you look at other situations that may not be true.  So I don't think it's a good thing for anyway, because I used to think like that.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: And either way you're going to get talked about.  If you whoop somebody's butt, you're going to get talked about and if you get beat up you're going to get talked about.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: It kind of seems like you're saying that fighting in that way is sort of a trap, it's like being a gunslinger, you know.  There's always somebody else that wants to have it with you.  Can you name other kinds of situations that makes your friends worry?  Not like tests or exams or stuff like that, but seeing a fight or hearing that someone has died or breaking off with a girlfriend or boyfriend.  What are some of the situations that you hear about?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I was at a boys and girls, like a [WORD] or whatever.  And I was trying to get this girl down, you know, I was macking to her, in other words.  Trying to be her boyfriend.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Macking?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: We hit it off, I mean, we really did.  We became the best of friends.  And we never hooked up, but I told her I was always there for her.  So she caught me one day and she was, like, you know, me and this guy just broke up.  I said, ah, he hurt your feelings.  And she said yeah.  And I said, yeah, you should have picked the right road with me, you know.  Try to ease up.  Back in the market.  It feels some day I feel like I don't want to live no more.  So I had to talk to her about that.  You know, I said that's another case, just like vice versa, instead of me being the person that my friends are talking about, she was the person that I'm talking about.  So, and I stopped somebody from killing them self.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: How'd you do that?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Well, first, I made her laugh, just to take her mind.  Excuse my, you know, the situation she was going to.  Then I got serious with her.  I said, you mean to tell me that this guy is that important for you to take your life?  And so she was, like, you know, and so I cheered her up and she was like, well, when you look at it, he was a dog anyway.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: So, actually, you mixed it up.  At first you got her laughing and then you got her serious to give her that perspective.  The big picture a little bit more again, like, come on, is it worth killing yourself over?  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: A guy can't be that important, you know. </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: And do you remember, was it—?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Like, I was, like, you're trying to kill yourself over this dude?  I was trying to make fun out of it, which I'm saying, when I did that, that made her laugh, you know what I'm saying.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I had to learn my lesson the hard way.  I ran away two Times.  The second Time I ran away for a guy and that was the biggest mistake you could ever make is doing something with a guy.  Sorry, no offense.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: You're right, you're right, I'm not worth it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: A guy wouldn't run away for a girl or kill himself over a girl.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: How did you learn your lesson though?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: My daddy took me to jail and then I went to Hope Haven, which is Catholic Charities. </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Oh, you've been there or are you there now?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Huh?  No, I've been there.  I mean, I'm out.  I saw somebody try to kill their self and I knew that I didn't want to be back there.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: In most situations that I notice, it's like, the girl is always doing something over a boy, but you would never catch a boy doing something over a girl.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Now, I do.  I punch a tree.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Another one.  SomeTimes being with other people and talking to other people helps in Times when you're stressed out.  Who do you go to for this kind of particular help and comfort?  When you're most stressed out, who do you go for, for help and comfort to talk?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: God. </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: My momma.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: My teacher.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I go to God first then I go to my friend.  Like, the situation with my friends, I've got a bunch of friends.  One thing effects one of my friends, it effects everybody around in that circle.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Is that the same thing as saying we help each other?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, we build each other up.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Here's one that's a little more serious.  What do you think is the hardest thing about speaking about bad experiences and traumas that you've had.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Embarrassed.  Being embarrassed that you go through it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, I think it's embarrassing that, like—.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: About the feelings that come up or the fact you've just been through it?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: About the feelings that's come up and the fact that you've been through it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: What I do, I don't care what people think about me.  You know, I'm not here to please no one.  I'm not.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I think the bad thing about is, like, okay, if you're talking to one of your best friends and it's like, in my situation I just moved into the house and I made friends and they know that she doesn't have any kids, you know, you've got to explain to them, well, I'm a foster child, my momma died.  And it's, like, they don't understand that because they have their mom and their parents and they don't understand and they think you're like the outside person.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: The cry baby.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's like someTimes you just, someTimes you just have to deal with it.  I like to go in my room and look at a mirror of myself.  I do.  The best thing about being a foster child is I go home, in my room and I shut the door and I look at myself in a mirror.  And I think about it.  I have mom just like they do.  I have a house now just like they do.  I go to school like they do, so I'm no different from them.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Edward?  You've been trying to say something, I want to get to you.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Me?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You had you hand up a couple of Times, yeah?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: He don't remember.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I forgot the question that she had asked.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: It was the one about what's hard for you about talking about bad experiences in your life.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I generally like her.  I get shy because down there where I come from, if you are so bad [UNINTELLIGIBLE] they start talking about [WORD] you have to talk about everybody.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: When you look in the mirror, it's like you're looking for one thing.  It's, like, something special that you're looking in the mirror for and you sit there and you look.  And eventually what you're looking at, it'll just open up all of a sudden, like the mirror changes.  And you see the beauty inside of you.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Is that what you're looking for?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I think Michael Jackson made a song, "I'm Looking at the Man in the Mirror."  [LAUGHTER]  </p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK OVERLAPPING]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: He's looking at little kids.  Sorry.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Well, that's tabloids, you know.  [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: I agree.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Okay, number seven.  How can helping adults, like teachers, counselors, principal, minister or parents speak to people your age that are trying to get over a bad experience?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: First approach is, like, they're on our level.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Exactly.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Instead of coming at us, like, you know what I'm saying, in order to be intellectually functioning the correct way corresponding, you know what I'm saying?  Sort of like that.  You have to come to us like we're coming to talk.  Like, the principal I knew, this is Ben speaking.  All right.  The principal I knew, they were more down to earth with us.  They knew what we were going through and they had more knowledge because they also went through kids that had the same problem and how they learn how to bounce back.  And they put a bunch of knowledge on your and then you go and you'll be, like, man, they're talking a bunch of noise.  You sit down and you think about it, it really comes to fact and you'll know what they were really saying to you.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Do you think the kind of person that tries to give you that knowledge, it's important that they be a certain kind of person, like, compassionate or loving or on your level or someone you can relate to?  Or do you think you could get it just as good from a book or a manual or something? </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: In some ways it is, and some ways it's not.  Because you can have tough love, you can have love.  You can go in a book and find it.  Any source that you get you're still the same information.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Does it depend on what you need at that Time?  I mean, if you need tough love one Time maybe you need somebody to really be more—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But it's better if you get a person.  Because then you'll rely on, this is just a book.  But if a person takes their Time to talk to you, you'll really feel like you're special for some reason. </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Do you all have memories of somebody like that?  A Time where it really got through to you what somebody was saying, whether it was a therapist or a counselor?  I mean, I just wondered.  All of you sitting here, can you definitely say, yeah, I've had that experience?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yes.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Yeah, who are they?  Say it out loud.  They're ministers someTimes.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Ministers, friends, teachers, principals, peers.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Say it everybody.  I want to know.  Who are the people that get through to you the best?</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: She was a bus driver, she died.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: So who talked to you about that?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: My grandma because she knew her very well.  Because she used to teach I think she said, or Miss Betty White used to teach her, I don't know.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: So, it's not always a therapist or a psychologist that is able to get through to you at those Times when you really need to get.  It can be someTimes a teacher or a principal, a mother or grandmother.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I think, like, I had something to say about, what he said, like, going to different people.  But, like, if I go through certain situations I don't always run to the person that is, you know, kind and loving because there's some situations I hope I have run to my brother and my brother is not exactly the best person.  He's been in jail and been shot.  But, I mean, it's just depending on the situation.  I mean, you can't always run to the best person that you think will handle the situation.  You've got to try different things.  You've got to mix up what you do.  You've got to trust the difference though.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: I hear you.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But, say, it's good to have a therapist and all, but you've got to think other people can't afford therapist.  Me and Mr. Shariff, he took me to the fair up there at River Oak.  You know, that was the first Time that I had talked about my sister and my grandma and my family.  I sit there and I talk for two hours just things just feelings that were coming out.  And I still had more to say.  But it's good to be able to know that somebody's there, at least one person that you can really sit down and they'll listen and hear you out and give you knowledge.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Especially somebody who doesn't know you to judge you.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, and chose that there are, and you can share your feelings with them but they won't tell.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: To keep the confidentiality is important.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I think it's harder for me, because I don't know if everybody in here has ever seen the person that they talk to.  But you know when I went to, what do you call it?  The psychiatrist?  I didn't exactly open to her like I'm doing to all of you.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Why?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's because I, the way that I thought that she would judge me.  I don't like people who don't know me to judge me.  That's why I always, if I'm having a problem, I always went to somebody that I have been knowing for over a year.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: A year.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Go to a new person and just say, hey, my mom and I just want to know how I can—.  I don't do that because I don't want that person to judge because they didn't understand and what trying to get out to them.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: When I listen to this tape someTime, whenever, my challenge is that there is almost two messages and I'm not sure how to put the two messages together.  Because one messages says to get over trauma and trouble you've got to make changes inside yourself.  You have to make, you've got to do it yourself, in a way.  It's really fun to do it unto yourself.  Another messages you've got to reach out and use the help of other people who can support you.  So, my question is, maybe there is no conflict.  Maybe you're saying it's both.  There's Times when you've got to do it for yourself and there's Times you've got—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I mean, you've got to mix the two together.  You can't expect to do it all with inside yourself.  You've got to mix it together.  You've got to people to help you and you've got to help yourself.  Because, first of all, if you're not helping yourself, nobody else is going to help you.  If you're not putting out the effort to help yourself.  So you've got to use it together.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: And tell if I'm crazy, well, I am crazy.  I'm also hearing you say you have to get over whatever your own personal resistance is, your own defensive, all the wanting to fight, the wanting to not tell anybody who you are, the aggression.  If you push away from yourself or from other people then you can get help.  You've got to, at some Time, open up to that connection, to those kinds of connections.  Does that sound right or no?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah.  I mean, that's just with me.  I don't know how other people are opened up to people.  But I just like to have seen the person more than one Time and talk to them before I just up and tell them something about me.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: So the right kind of professional for you would be somebody who's patient enough to try to drag everything out of you.
	
<p>ANN LARKIN: The first day, yeah.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Right.  Somebody who you can tell, well, then say it, take your Time, we'll get to it, you know.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Well, okay.  As far as what she said, she said, like when she need, well, she don't like, you know, she's dishing out all of her facts about herself to an unknown person she just met.  SomeTimes that can be good and someTimes it can't.  Okay, as far as me, my first Time, you know, it's like, the lady tried to slap me on medication.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I have been through in the past, she won't to slap me on medication now.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Anger medication.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: What happened was, I played her, you know.  Instead of slap me on medication, I got everybody else involved, like, the therapist and the foster parent and everybody.  It was, like, no, he doesn't need to be on medication or the same in the past.  And they said, we're going to put him on medication because there's a possibility that he's about to have an outburst.  He don't know how to handle things in the past.  I said that because I agree with her.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Out of curiosity, how many of you have had people try to do that, the same thing?  The hands.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Is that to say you're all against medication?</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN:  Hold on.  I'm not against medication, but I want to know what you're putting me in.  For real, it's like, you know, they weren't telling me the stuff, what's the purpose of this?</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: You want them to explain it to you, why, what's in it?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: And then when they explain the purpose, they don't tell you everything.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Don't tell the side effects.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I mean, I don't totally disagree with taking medication but I know this girl and they tried to do the same thing.  They slapped on medication, the girl took it.  She wasn't crazy or retarded.  But I started noticing the change, like, she really was retarded or whatever, after she started taking that medicine.  And it's like I'm not understanding just because a person act a certain way why would you just up and say, hey, you need this medication or that medication and you're not telling them why.  And, I mean, that's just not, I mean, you've got to have a specific reason why.  You've got to find something wrong with my brain telling me I need medication.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: You're bringing up a big controversy right now because some people think, some scientists think that when a person is under stress and trauma that they need medication to help them to stay cool, to stay tranquilized, to stay not agitated, to not be so agitated.  And other people say, no, well—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: That's life.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: You need to go through, that's life.  You need to go through it and deal with your feelings and learn to not to depend on the medication.  So it's a little bit confused right now about what exactly is the right thing.  What did you want to say?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Well, that's true.  I went to the doctor one Time and they put me on two different medications that do the same thing.  I mean, everybody said that I was fine until I got my medicine and then I was snapping at, on everybody ready to light it into them.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Ready to fight.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah.  I mean, they thought I went crazy so I got, went on [WORD, OVERLAPPING LAUGHS].</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: The first Time I went, it took me, like, 10 or five or six meeting just for me to open up to the man.  The first meeting I had, he had to drag stuff out of me.  I was tired.  I actually was starting to go to sleep.  I didn't want to talk to the man because I didn't know him, and he didn't know me.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, all right, man.  I feel like I'm talking on my sleep.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It gave me some medicine, some antidepressant.  When I took that medicine, I started getting sleep.  And the less and less sleep I got, the more and more edgy I got.  So he finally gave me the right medicine after we had discussed what we had.  And it helped me to get my sleep back.  And now I'm not all edgy and ready to jump and fight like I used to be.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You can take that medicine though, too, because every—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I took that, I took Zokloff [AS SAID].</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Zoloft.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Zoloft, whatever.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: They put me on some medicine and I used to like be normal with my bladder.  And still my dad, like, when I was 12, something, I started having diarrhea and stuff.  [LAUGHTER]  You're not even listening.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's not a shame to tell the truth.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: For real.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Absolutely, thank you.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Charlie, I heard you say that you were taking some medications and that you didn't like it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I didn't see a change in me at all.  And then they took off that medicine.  Whoever she was, I was so mad.  I had that medicine—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It does help though.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: More for a year.  Because I was so mad.  Then my mom and my grandmother said they didn't see a change in me at all. </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I saw a change in myself.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Me, too.</p>

<p>[MISCELLANEOUS CONVERSATIONS]</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Listen up.  We're almost done here, so I want to hear what you have to say.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: We have two or three more questions.  Do you ever, so how can you tell when a friend's having a bad experience?  I mean, things like you can't sleep, you feel sad.  You can't eat.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: What are the signs?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You know, you have trouble paying attention.  What are the signs that something bad has happened?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Stop eating.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You start getting slim.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Losing appetite?  Or eating too much.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Can't focus?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Can't focus? </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Just say it out.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I will go to sleep, I will stop eating at one period of Time.  And you know me, not eating.  That's, like, my parents were looking at me, like, what was the problem with you?  I wasn't eating.  You know, I'm sitting at a table, food all the way up to here.  I mean, they call me a bottomless pit.  [LAUGHTER]  I would get no sleep.  I had trouble breathing at night.  My nose would stop up.  I had nose bleeds.  I had stress up to here.  Every Time I got mad my head would swell up and I could feel the fever and the anger and everything just boil up inside of me.  I had to go outside to cool off.  I don't know why it was just a, you know, if I got mad it was like my blood would just boil and I could fill it and, like, my flesh would crawl and stuff. </p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Like, when I have stuff like that, what I do is normally I'll tell them I'll go buy some, it's some specific food.  I tell my mom to go buy some Pop-Tarts and some cereal and I will stuff myself with Pop-Tarts and cereal because I feel like it's a hole and it needs to be filled with sweet food.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Like on Thanksgiving, the plate, I mean, the table's like full from there, I ain't never cereal and Pop-Tarts and all that.  Our grandma like, boy, if you don't eat any of this food, I know some.  But the only thing I ate was Kool-Aid and pie, that's it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Kool-Aid pie?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Kool-Aid and pie.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Okay, that's it.  One last chance on this last question.  Listen.  Of all the things that we've been talking about that have to do with stress, that have to do with trauma, that have to do with getting over it, that have to do with the change you need to make inside yourself or the help you need to get from other people, is there anything that we haven't mentioned at all that when I walk out of here I would be missing something, that I should know, something we should add to this thing, that we should think about.  One thing I can tell you already is I don't think there's enough in here about kind of like the spiritual experiences and the church and the things you can get from your particular belief about God and I've already got that from you guys and I think we need to look at that more.  What else?  Is there something else that's missing?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I agree, you do need to add some stuff in there about church.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: And God, you know, belief in something.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You should recommend that they should start reading the Bible every day, go to church and all that stuff.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: All right.  How this happen with me, you can't just set up the book of, you know, you have to go inside of you.  It can't be forced.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, you've got to put the Bible in the church and folks make them do it.  You've got to, you know, they've got to do it on their own.  That's why, the church my brother and sister go to, I don't go to because it's not—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I mean, what it is, is like, you can't, just because your mom or your dad or whoever tell you, go read about, you need to do this.  You can read it and not, you can read it and say, hey, Momma, I read it, or hey, Dad, I read it.  But if you don't get it—.  You're reading it because they told you to.  If you want to get a meaning out of it and want it to mean something to you, you've got to want it.  You just can't do it and say, hey, Momma, I read it.  </p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But you don't necessarily have to read the Bible and everything to be a Christian.  </p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: The other thing I've heard from you guys that I haven't heard from anybody else is that there are moments, very important moments, where something moves you or something emotional happens that might be termed, you know, changing your life in a positive way, where you realize something about fighting or you realize something about how to deal with a parent dying or something.  So it's almost like these are these moments of importance that occur if you're open to it.  And I don't know if it happens, probably luck or coincidence or if there's a way that other people could be encouraged to have those kind of experiences.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Like Jeremiah said in the Bible, it felt like fire on the inside of me.  And, well it was fire shut off up in my bones.  It's like a feeling, you know.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: That's very powerful.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: If you, like she was saying, you can't, what the preacher tells you, that he don't want you to be forced by going to church, he wants you to do it yourself because you can be saved and all, but you won't like to be saved.  You'll just think this is something else they want me to do.  I don't feel like doing this.  I hate going to church.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But technically you're not saved.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: True.
	
	A:	I don't think you have to go, I do not believe, I mean, I go to church, but I don't think you have got to go to church or, you know, praise God every day.  I mean, I go to a Christian school and that's one thing I do not believe.  I do not believe that you have to go to church every day and I believe you have to read the Bible every day to be a Christian.  I mean, you could be a Christian and not even step a foot in church.  I mean, there's some places that don't have church, but you can't say they're not a Christian because they're not going.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I mean, it's piece by piece.  You could be a Christian and not go to church like you said because if God wants you to see a certain point he will, I mean, he'll reveal it to you.  </p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I'm not in church every Sunday, but I do go to church.  It's just like people judging you.  If you dress differently or you look differently.  I mean, if you turn around and you drive somebody, right.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Your own version, your own perspective of what God is, that's what matters.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, the scripture in the Bible that says come as you is.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Edward?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Just think about it.  I think you do supposed to go to church to be a Christian.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I don't.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Like the Bible said, God worked for six days and then on the seventh day—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: He rests.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, you got to rest.  You're supposed to go and worship God.  </p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: The which days you're supposed to work, and on Sunday that's the day that God rest.  That's the way that you rest.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: But you're supposed to worship God every day and I know good and well not every one of you, of you go to church every day.</p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You don't think about it though.  You are all raised from different parents.  All of you had different beliefs.  Everybody in here is stating their opinion.  Everybody in here is stating their opinion because these two, you're saying different things.  You're saying that you don't have to go to church every day to be a Christina.  He says you have to go to church every day.  All of you are saying something different, and it's your opinion of what you are.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's not a true fact.  Because God works in mysterious ways.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It's not proven nowhere that you have to be a Christian and go to church and worship God on Sunday.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You don't.  No, no, no, no.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: How about, hang on, hang on.  I don't want to get into that kind of argument because we have to stop.  But the real deal is it sounds like it's about finding for yourself what works to help you heal, to help you get over whatever it is that has occurred in your life that has hurt you.  It sounds like that's what it is.  And it can be different for every person.  And that's what it sounds like you're saying.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I have a fact about this.  It is that, it does say on the Bible, on Sunday you're supposed to go and worship God at church.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: It doesn't say that.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I have to say this.  I mean, you might think that I'm bad at this, but I don't believe in everything that the Bible says because actually half of the stuff, it's like, you know, if you kill yourself you're going to Hell.  I'm sorry, I don't believe that because if you're in so much pain, I don't believe it.  I believe if you're in so much pain or whatever the situation may be, I'm not saying go kill yourself because your boyfriend or girlfriend broke up with you.  I'm just saying that I disagree with a lot of stuff that is in the Bible.  And, you know, if you don't agree with me, that's fine, but that's just—.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I agree.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: The Bible is made up with different books of Peter, Drayton and all them.  That's what they say, what they feel inside of them.  Not a true fact.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: Okay, thank you, all of you very much for coming here.  I hope this was something rewarding for you in some way.  Maybe just a piece of—.  But I appreciate your sense of humor.  I appreciate your serious comments.  I appreciate everything you said.  So, thank you very much.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Thank you.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: You're welcome.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Thank you for having us.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: I really appreciated this, you know.</p>

<p>JOSH LOMAN: We got it.  Whatever it is you guys want to become and be and stuff, do it.</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, I'm going to remember this.  </p>

<p>[SEVERAL SPEAK SIMULTANEOUSLY]</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Hey, you want to do this again?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, when we are we going to do this again?</p>

<p>ANN LARKIN: Yeah, that's right.  Let's schedule an appointment.  As long as you don't do it on the game day, it's all right with me.</p>
