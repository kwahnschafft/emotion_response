<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Arizona?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, someplace. It was shocking how cold it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It was like the mid 60's every day. It was really nice. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What part of Arizona where you in?</p>

<p>CLIENT: A bunch. We're in Tucson, then up North to Flagstaff, then we went through the Grand Canyon area and then Phoenix and I spent the last day in Sedona. So. I heard it is like unusual to have that nice of weather for this time of the year. Because usually it's in the 40's and 50's and kind of rainy, but we lucked out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Cool</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, a good time. So our Father was thinking a lot over the trip and he and I were talking a lot and I felt good about us, but then I realized like... We were talking and he kind of cracked it as a joke but I did not take like. But I was thinking was kind of true. We were talking about like work and personal life and he said how like, "I work like I'm so like rigid and organized and I care about it so much and I don't take enough time to care about myself and kind of my personal life is a mess and I make it a priority."</p>

<p>[00:01:13]</p>

<p>Which I think is true and that even saying that with him, like I left for work. I worked like last week and then I left in a hurry and I got on a plane and everything and what did I miss? Did I do this or do that? Then I get to Arizona and I am just still in work mode and I can't let that go. By Monday morning, I had to be like, OK hold that. Like you are on vacation. I was going to make it a rule to like not check my e-mail, try not to talk about work unless a crisis happens.</p>

<p>But, so I feel like I do that for work and obviously I care about work, but it is not my life. My flawed passion, but then I feel like, like important things like him have gone by the wayside when I am. Not thrown by the wayside but it's like I do this unconsciously. And like the first three days of vacation that I have given him my full attention and I had the most quality time with him, because I am stressing over work.</p>

<p>[00:02:15]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then I was thinking that I do feel like some aspects of my life could ever, not out of control but I don't have control over them? So I am extra controlling at work so I think that is the one thing that I have lots of control over? You know I can always think of myself like the most successful or that I don't know. I always knew on some level but just sitting talking about it with him kind of made it more apparent. I didn't like that. I place work over everything because I should... Because I feel like I work because it is my livelihood. But I work so I can have like money to do things with the ones I love. And all that's from just working, working, working and not time with her. I kind of feel like what's the point.</p>

<p>[00:03:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that was... I look at every script then I kind of realized that. I felt a little like oh, I don't want to be like this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And it kind of made me feel like my Dad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel like he always puts work over everything and doesn't really care about anything else. And I think of having issues was not being like him, its just something like you have missed out on so many things with your family. Even though he's a difficult man I feel like his work ethic kind of played into the divorce a little because he was never around. So it is just things like they aren't really good traits to have and I don't really want. But I spent a little time thinking about that.</p>

<p>[00:04:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's when the comment made you start thinking about it pretty quickly?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. Yeah and I know I never felt or never thought of it in a sense of like control, but I feel like that's kind of like what it really is. If I am not happy with something usually I just re-shift my focus 100 percent towards work because it is [indiscernible at 00:04:30] that I actually who fell out of control right. And start overachieving in that aspect of any of it to deal with like my personal issues. That's the best way to handle it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I am like how do I hint like it's like being wired with this one thing but how do I continue to handle both. So the last month and a half of work has been really, really stressful. It kind of concluded with my vacation. I supposed I planned it that way but it is just year-end and you get performance appraisals and it is a very lengthy process. So I felt like I recognized like you are working around the clock and a part of me feels like there is a task that was involved a lot of work and I kind of had to do that to get it done partially.</p>

<p>[00:05:24]</p>

<p>But then I am like such a perfectionist and control freak that I feel like that I really didn't take it to the next level and worked more maybe that I should have and I don't know I feel bad. Because the last six weeks we haven't talked, we haven't done anything or care. All we have done is talked about is work but in my head at the time I am just like work, work, work. I need to get this done and it has be done right.</p>

<p>Well, and then I feel bad because it's like I am blindsided which is kind of selfish I think but I am just so caught up in my own work world. That I never see anything else that is going on. And then yeah, I mean my work doesn't give me that much pleasure that I should be that wrapped up in it. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What kind of sense of control do you feel like it gives you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I guess I am doing well at something? Because I think I am really good at my job. So it's kind of like, God another project complete and another success. I guess another like I don't want to say trophy, but like in the largest thing that I have contributed that has helped the company or its helped streamline something.</p>

<p>[00:06:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's measurable.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. So I don't know if like in my head. Like I am very like I like to check things off when it starts running off through my head like I have got some easy thing for me to check off and it is harder for me to check off my personal successes? I don't know. I mean, I don't know it would be maybe one things are going bad at home it's hard for me to feel like I am like contributing something positive towards them? But I feel like that it works and that's why I like I overextend myself?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, it was kind of shocking because like at the end of the day I really feel like it came down to control. And I am thinking I am like a control freak was like look I am so easy going in a lot of the aspects but, I guess I do want like the control and for things to be my way sometimes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So how does liking control make you a freak?</p>

<p>[00:08:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know. I think there is kind of a stigma. It's kind of overbearing and everything has to be just so or I mean actually this is true to myself. Like everything has to be just so or like I have maybe a hard time dealing with it, or it's like an adjustment for me. So if I get to have it the way I want then it's I guess easier for me or more comfortable.</p>

<p>Yeah, [indiscernible at 00:08:45] when I said about projects it didn't sound very positive. (chuckle) And so how do I gain control? I do feel like I think my personal life hasn't been the best the last couple of years or so. And I just constantly focus on work instead of dealing with those issues. I feel like it really has surfaced a lot in the last, like since [indiscernible at 00:09:18] tonight the break-up like that was the breaking point, but you know just like the issues with like my parents. It is more it's like the part of me it feels like it is like the choice that I don't have.</p>

<p>[00:09:28]</p>

<p>So like I try to talk to my Mom before and ended up in a big fight. We didn't talk for maybe a little over a year so I feel like I didn't really have a choice to discuss it with her. So my choice at that moment was to not speak to her but then I faced another choice and like it was like do you kind of let go and have some sort of relationship with her? Or do you continue to not speak?</p>

<p>And then at that point I felt like why not speak with her forever, so kind of let go but I never... We still haven't addressed the fact that I am still really angry with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Was it your decision not to speak for that year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She had told me like I don't appreciate the things – it was through e-mail. Basically, she was like if you can't accept me the way I am and what happened then don't speak to me at all. So, I said fine we won't speak. And then they added stuff like their things like they need to talk about, but actually take responsibility for them and she was just like, "I am sorry we got divorced and you are upset about it. But..."</p>

<p>I forgot what exactly she said, but it was just if you are not happy then don't speak to me. And so part of me felt like it was a little, I don't think I did it to be like I'm holding out to speak to you, but I kind of felt like well you don't really care if I am upset. And it is kind of like talking to a brick wall, so I guess I won't speak to you if you don't want to listen to what I have to say, so.</p>

<p>[00:11:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But. Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: A year is a long time.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did you think about her during that year?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and no. I did but I felt like I almost felt guilty that I didn't care as much as I felt like I should have.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It really bothered my brother. And he moved back home. Can you please come for this holiday? And I was like no. Then finally, he kind of like organized like a get together on neutral ground. And then we started speaking again. But, yeah. She was like I stole it from people lie so she'd said like she had moved out and she was living alone, but really she was living with her boss. And then she said she was moving in with her boss so they could help her out financially with his family. She was like staying in a room with her so it was just I guess another day makes me real uncomfortable and people lie to me to me. I feel like... I don't know. I feel like it is kind of like a cowardly thing to do. Why don't you just say the truth and face the consequences if someone is upset with you.</p>

<p>But, yeah it just make me real uncomfortable because I feel like are you lying to me? Do you, I don't know. I feel like it's almost like they are trying like make a fool of me.</p>

<p>[00:12:45]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So, it still makes me like a little uncomfortable when we are there and not when we are talking about Thanksgiving and he was just kind of like, "I don't why you think you have to be a billion places at once. And why don't you just tell Mom you don't want to go." Which I kind of at Christmas I am only doing one parent at a time this year.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um, B.S. when she like lies about going places, but then there are like pictures around the house like she is on vacation with her Mom. But then there is like a picture of her and her boss from like this trip that they took like years ago that she lied about. I just feel like really uncomfortable and like do I call her out on it? Do I pretend that I don't notice?</p>

<p>[00:13:35]</p>

<p>But then sometimes we will like talk about it. Like on "My trip in Disney World that was so great." And then in my head I am just thinking, you said you were with your Mom like do you think we would have found out at some point? Or, I'm almost embarrassed to like to address it with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it sounds like she doesn't really do much; she doesn't make much effort to hide it. Because I don't think like she isn't going into great lengths.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Then she doesn't, she wants a lot about work. He's not her boss anymore because he took like a different position. And I remember hearing got promoted and then she left the area she was in and went to another area. So then they were different but she like so want to her [indiscernible at 00:14:16] about not seeing him, which I get to a point that you want keep a relationship private. But it has been years and I feel at this point has to like make up these elaborate stories to have it make since. But sometimes it doesn't.</p>

<p>[00:14:32]</p>

<p>And but she has her mail forwarded to like her Mom's house so people won't catch on that they are dating. But a couple of times she like asks me if I was in Nashville to visit or not if I would pick up a magnet or something at the airport. Because when she was away with him she said that she was like in Nashville visiting me. I don't even live in Nashville.</p>

<p>And I don't know why it bothers me so much, of course I feel like it is on me at the end of the day. I am not talking to her co-workers so I really shouldn't care, but I don't know. I just, why do you have to lie about things and I guess I don't know how to confront people. Because it is like I tend feel really embarrassed and part of me like if I feel like if I ask you like Mom, did you to lie about this? Why did you do this?</p>

<p>She is still going to say, "No, I'm in Disney with Nana." And then that kind of makes me feel bad that she was still lying, but then I am kind of like, OK well I will think. Sorry, how do argue with someone because who continually lies to you? So she like, I just don't even ask the question because I know the answer. But that is not good to heal or like aspects of my life, but it is like I don't want to ask. Because I'm like scared of what the answer is and how to move forward once I get the answer.</p>

<p>[00:16:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I start doing things like. Like it will happen like, even with the start of in our nice relationship I feel like we for the longest time like we were only seeing each other but we have never had this discussion about if we were seeing other people. And it became like understood that it was just the two of us like we are spending.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Pretty much every day together and but I felt like I was like so kind of scared that he may not want to say like he wants to be exclusive with like the topic didn't get brought up for like six plus months.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But it wasn't until before like he was love for Nashville that we kind of finalized that we were together but now I needed to face what we were going to do once he left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>[00:16:59]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually when I approached things like with my Dad it is the same thing almost. Like I know I will ask because I feel like I know the answer. I felt like maybe 85 percent of the time it will but, looking George is like an honest person so I shouldn't... Like any time that I have ever had to approach topic with him I really haven't been like let down or disappointed. Whereas with my parents I felt like right now I am in this place were actually this question I got answers are like. I feel it's like a fake answer.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. Did your Mother used to lie? Do you know?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. About like, she was like and we talked while she shopped a lot.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She would just like lie about things like that. Like she would be like, "Oh yeah, I only got it for 25 percent of the cost." Everyone could see the receipt and she would. And then she would say she got something for free and she didn't. Or, but looking back now there were lots of situations were I am like, was she lying about that?</p>

<p>[00:18:09]</p>

<p>She went to New York City one weekend. She said she was [indiscernible at 00:18:13] and maybe about a year before they got divorced. And she came back with like her credit card bill was like astronomical and I remember like my parents would fight about it. He never really looked at bills but for some reason he looked at this one. And there was like, not high ticket items, but like a lot of like perfume and some like jewelry. And he would be like, "Well where is this stuff?" And she is like, "Oh I had to charge it for other people. They gave me the money."</p>

<p>But now I think was she seeing the boss the time and like that was gift for him and his family?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I am like where would gifts like that go that your family doesn't know about? If someone had the cash to pay for them, they just pay for them or maybe someone didn't have the money and she did a nice deed. I don't know, but it just seems like that could have been a lie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And just like that makes me really like skeptical. Like I just don't trust a lot of people. And it is not a matter of like I feel like they – I just don't take a lot of stock into what people say.</p>

<p>[00:19:32]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To insert less of what are you up to no good, are you suspicious. Are you doing something to hurt me. I just feel like, I don't know. I won't tell somebody white lies. Like how do you pull away truth from a lie.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my Dad lies about business things and some aspects of his personal life and I just feel like everyone just fibs by nature.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. That's really unsettling to feel that way.</p>

<p>[00:20:10]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I feel like it almost like becomes, I almost with that I felt more unsettled. Because I feel like I am so like can say something and it is like in one ear and out the other. Because I feel like maybe it is not true. How much effort should I spend about thinking about this? And then I don't know I feel like it is not a good default weight to think. That's why maybe not telling the truth. Some like to think that people can be truthful until like proven otherwise. I don't like that I just feel like, like defaults on the line.</p>

<p>I feel like it has gotten a little bit better because I like separated myself from my parents a little bit? And I almost like – I feel like I'm almost humored without interest, kind of like, OK. Oh it's been fun.</p>

<p>The other thing important things because I can't have a conversation with them because it's just like fibs and fake.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>[00:21:18]</p>

<p>CLIENT: so, and I guess every time I distance myself from like every time I distance myself from my Dad, I feel better. But then I feel bad though, like he and I don't hardly speak. And then my Mom, it's like I've accepted the like the distance and I'm OK with that. Or maybe it bothers me a little bit because I talk about it but for a few months doesn't like, I really think about. Oh I wish my relationship was better with her was I do with my Dad.</p>

<p>But I think it bothers me a lot because it doesn't bother me. I'm kind of pissed, like it is what it is.</p>

<p>[00:22:02]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And they feel like it – actually they just get confused about it because feel like it should. But then when I think about them both it really bothered me all the time. You don't want to walk around like we really, really are upset about it constantly.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I was going to say something else and now I just forgot. Mm, now I've lost it but... I forgot but, I feel like my parents and I should be almost closer? Or like, I don't know I feel like maybe I should had a hard time look adapting to like the change of the divorce. But, my relationship with them, even now like as a family but like individually it was better before the divorce.</p>

<p>And then now like they are divorced and well that possess some challenges I feel like both of them just act like their own kids. And so it makes it hard and me being like the parent I'm without a doubt I feel like I don't want to be like that. So I just - but I end up thinking like all I want to talk to you is I am really not talking to you because I'm accepting like that is what our relationship may be for a while? Or am I not talking to you because I don't want to deal with you.</p>

<p>[00:23:43]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: My Dad and I just like carry on a conversation with, I called him yesterday and he was like, "Oh, what have you been up to? And the calls on vacation, remember? And he was like, "Oh that's nice." And then he just talked about like the gluten free bread that he got because he has celiac disease. And it was just like silence on the phone and I asked him a couple of questions and then he just answers them like grumble and then he is like, "All right, on to my paperwork. Bye."</p>

<p>I am kind of like why did I even call you? And he gets angry if he doesn't call you. And he doesn't really have any sort of an interest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I feel like this obligation to call him. When I call it doesn't really talk about anything. Anything I fuck I always have like these obligation and like loyalties to my family. But I don't think that they have the same loyalties back so I feel so loyal and dedicated to them.</p>

<p>[00:25:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Recognize that I have been talking like after Thanksgiving when you are like yourself stressed out. Do you think if they are liked stressed out as you are about Thanksgiving and Christmas plans? No, they are like. This is what we are having – come. And they are a little irrational and if you don't come they will be upset. But they are not like, [indiscernible at 00:25:27] please. And then you are going to be tired. And you have been travelling all day. And I feel like I think about all those things.</p>

<p>They don't so why should I put all effort or gets so stressed out about it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. Maybe you need to care for you and for them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Mm-hm. Yeah. I know sometimes, like caring for me does not, I feel like it is hard to do both. Because what is right for me seems to be like completely opposite of what they want. So actually it is one or the other. Or one and a half like a little disappointment on one end.</p>

<p>Like spending our Christmas actually I feel like I am caring for me but they are like upsetting my Dad more for one of the holidays. I fell like does does that. Does the guilt that I have from setting him outweigh the pleasure that I have from only going to only one Holiday on Christmas?</p>

<p>[00:26:39]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I feel like that's enough. Like I get to relax a little more. I get to you know see a friend. But then he a fairly upset and it makes me feel bad. I don't enjoy it. He's not doing anything – like if I address him like, all those Holiday and everyone comes here I would feel like he wouldn't even come. So it's not really a – there is no middle ground.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then I feel like well what if I didn't even live in the area? What if I – I don't know. I just think what I do for the Holidays is not like sustainable long term because like I am not going to be able to go to both of their houses forever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Short term fix to keep them happy? But I feel like this is just ultimately not make me happy. And then its just not that I would remain like that. I feel like more and more holiday as it is now. Like I'm starting to go to Nashville more, or spend it with an [indiscernible at 00:27:43] Look at what happens like as you get older like you are sinning for others. So you take a role and first have to things.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you feel would happen if you stopped trying to make them happy?</p>

<p>[00:28:00]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I feel my Mom wouldn't say anything. Well, my Dad won't say anything either, but I feel like it would come up in passive aggressive ways. And it is just like no one talks so I feel like that's what make me feel like more uncomfortable. Like if someone had said to me like, I don't know like I'm really sad that you don't come anymore. Or something like I feel like that's what I think because you could like talk about it.</p>

<p>There is just no talking with a mistress. My Mom doesn't say anything and you can just tell like the look in her face how upset she is. And my Dad like gets really angry and like hold these grudges. It's just like he doesn't have this conversation where you are like...</p>

<p>They are hard for me, you know to do other things too because he just gets angry and like, "Your family should be number one." You know, "You should never let them down." And then it's like this conversation how like I am the bad guy. So I feel like I just go along telling what he wants, but then it just doesn't end. It is not making me happy.</p>

<p>He was complaining about New Year's a couple of weeks ago, I'm giving you Christmas and Thanksgiving. I'm even spending New Year's with you when I'm in town, I don't think New Year's is a big deal. And then like well maybe he feels lonely? But, I don't know that just makes me feel bad. Then I'm like should I go away for New Year's? I mean that runs through my head for a second, it's not like Christmas where I should look. I should really say, but I'm constantly, should I you know, not do what is right for me and do what's right for him for a second. So.</p>

<p>[00:29:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. There is this constant conflict.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And the only difference is like, for smaller holidays it's like the whole pain of guilt. But then the big ones it's like, a big obstacle. So. You know like I said, I just feel bad that he's alone. And then like I know sometimes if we talk about it I'm like, if I was alone would I want someone to you know would I want to spend the whole days alone? But then I think that I also wouldn't want to have someone to coming to see me and feel like disgruntled about it.</p>

<p>But I think what bothers me the most is like I'm seeing him but I really don't want to? Well of course I want to see him, but I'm like not really excited to be there. So I think like in terms of myself, like if all of these people are just coming to see me out of pity or obligation and they are not excited. Like that would really stink.</p>

<p>And so, I start thinking in terms of myself as bad and then I think I want to know. I should be there so they are not alone. Yeah, so is he really scared of being alone? I don't know.</p>

<p>[00:31:22]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you think that is what keeps you going, sort of staying tied to your parents the way you are?</p>

<p>CLIENT: More so my Dad. I feel like my Mom's – I feel like I have like this obligation to my Mom, but it is I don't have as many issues with as I do my Dad. But the fact that I spend like a little bit of time there. I feel like I need to be there. But I know that she is OK because she has other people and it's more I feel like this formal process that I go through.</p>

<p>But like with my Dad I feel like I like yeah. I need to be there. He can't be alone. And then I start thinking of him being alone and get really sad. And then I think of myself and so. But my Mom it's just more like, "Need to see you around the Holiday." So lets just go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well maybe also it's the obligations that make you feel less around them. That you imagined that benefit is feeling more free, but then maybe you would feel more alone. Just not feeling that connection to them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean I think I feel, because I tend to feel bad about not well it's like I feel I feel bad about not wanting to do things. So I feel like maybe you know when I'm doing the obligations I feel like I'm doing a good job. But not having that, that feeling I don't think I would feel. Like I think if I didn't see them, I think as long as I had something to do I wouldn't feel alone.</p>

<p>[00:33:13]</p>

<p>Maybe that's how relations are what make me feel like I'm doing my due diligence? Yeah, I guess you can check with my Dad and just like, I'm not in a rush to get married or anything. So should I give, I don't know if I'm overwhelmed when I'm or if I'm married when I'm in my like in my 40's or 50's and I don't know. I could easily be like him. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are you that similar?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I hope not. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So for you to say I could easily be like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you know I guess. Well maybe I am worried about being like him. I don't know. I mean I think I have a lot of friends that maybe my brother and I have a much better relationships than him? Um, but I guess that's is my fear of ending up like him. Because no one wants to be around him. And I don't know, that's just like somehow it's like really like affected me; what I'm like. I don't want people to think about that about me.</p>

<p>[00:34:44]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I think its; I mean I really feel bad. No one, like we talked about this before, if he can't maintain any relationships. But I think that I am the only one that goes, goes to his holidays because they may feel like a little bad for him because he's alone. Or they feel like their cousin that's coming with their husband and kids after all. And they feel like they really felt like it was their obligation to go. And then that just fizzled out. And I mean another cousin; a couple of cousins that came who we always spent the Holidays with before and they started coming. And he thinks its because of the divorce, but I think it's because you are so nasty to them.</p>

<p>[00:35:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But he can't.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this the cousins with the cake?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So, and I can't pinpoint like why I have this deep rooted fear of like being like him, because I don't think that I am. But, I don't know I'm kind of like because I freaking want it . I don't want to sit at home like some people like from who don't know him, but people who really don't like him.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except that it makes me feel almost bad. And he like thinks people like him and I don't know. I feel like I feel bad about so many things and I don't know why.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. do you think it's worst that he thinks people like him?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I feel like that he's almost – like he's thinking about their. He thinks that they like him, but they really don't. So it's like behind his back. Or they like are saying something. Or they like, Oh My God this Holiday again. (chuckle) And he thinks that it is like, you know fine or good. So.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>[00:36:50]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I know it put things in terms of myself and I don't really know why, but then I think of myself. If I was around a bunch of people and I thought that they were having a great time around me and liked me, and then really they didn't. They were like inviting me over out of pity, that's really stinky.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So. Maybe I said it wrong likes so it doesn't bother him. I mean for him if he knew it he would be more upset.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But he doesn't want to serve or live under illusions or delusions. That for you would be the worst case scenario.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. The first thing I would rather be grumpy. Not have him write me a note about it then think about it. You know? People love me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't know why. Like it's just this little zing. Like every time he says like people love me. My customers love me. My own kids don't love me. It – I don't know it just really bothers me. And it's not like a hurtful thing, it's just like this annoyance that I am like, you think everyone likes you but people who like shouldn't like you and they are important to you don't.</p>

<p>And that, I don't know. I just like, an annoyances only word like I can say. I don't think it really angers me, but.</p>

<p>[00:38:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well it's not designed to make you feel good.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Makes me feel like it makes me want to run my mouth, because I want to be like. Like I want to tell him this, but I feel like it's mean. He's not like a person you can have a typical conversation with.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm. It seems like in they're in different ways neither of your parents can take the truth.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You have to sort of hide it. Or they just do their own thing with the truth. They can't tolerate it. Like you are telling your Mom about how you felt about the divorce and I imagine she'd be also, not denying the divorce but how she went about getting divorced. And she just couldn't take it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. I felt that kind of leads me into my like I have a choice, but not really a choice. Because I feel like they trust us to do things, but I don't know I feel like I just am reasonable, with reasonable people you can have a conversation with. And have like a you know, we can do it this way, or we can do it this way. And I felt with my parents it's like, we can not talk about it, or you can not talk to me. I'm like. So. I feel like Mom i so frozen that she stinky choices. It's like how do I deal with it.</p>

<p>[00:40:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because I felt like the more I lean on my Mom. Like when we start talking and their all nice and warm fuzzy that we are talking again. But now like I found myself over their house and you are just kind of like, disgruntled about it a little bit. Like they're all talking about, I don't know.</p>

<p>Like talk like they are happy times and sometimes they will sometimes mention my Dad. I don't know. I feel like it's kind of insensitive and a little rude.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How do they mention your Dad?</p>

<p>[00:40:35]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well just like stupid things. Like the holidays. They are like, "Oh is he cooking like Italian food too?" We will have like an Italian course and a Turkey course. The Italian and the main course and I'm just like, no we are not. What type of Italian is he if he doesn't do that? I'm like, well there is three of us and we are having Italian here. Why would he make like the you know this four-course meal and having the same thing.</p>

<p>He had had some words with my Mom's boyfriend and I don't really know the details. But they will bring it up at the dinner table. And I'm just kind of like. And I'm also kind of like defensive of him, but then I feel like that is just kind of rude to do them. Kind of like, Hello I'm his kid. Not really appropriate, you know it's not like I don't talk to.</p>

<p>[00:41:31]</p>

<p>Once in a while I'll talk to my Mom like about my Dad's issues and my frustrations with him, but I try not to talk about him and her. Because I don't think that she talks about it with her significant other and I don't know. I personally don't feel like its right to discuss that with them? Because if they bring it up and it's non of her boyfriend's family's business with what's going on with my Dad I feel like.</p>

<p>I feel like just not to bring it up. I don't know. I don't take pleasure or like they'll. I had to actually ask my Mom to stop doing this because it was really bothering me. So I remember she, like everything is we, we, we. Her and her boyfriend. Her boyfriend doesn't really know me and I don't really know him and then she makes it seem like what is this. Great happy family – not his kid. He's only 12 years older than me.</p>

<p>[00:42:31]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Really? He's a lot younger than her?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much younger is he?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He's like in his early 40's and she is 51. So, ten years or so. The whole dynamic is just, I mean insane. Like he lives with his Mom and Dad and they live in the house with them. Not in like a basement apartment or anything, they have their own bedroom. Which reminds me of little kids, but they have their own bedroom and then they have one of the brothers lives there who is actually my age. And then there is another brother who lives in Arizona with twins, he is my age as well.</p>

<p>So it's like when I am there the boyfriend's Mom is like talking to me like I'm her kid because she has two sons that are my age. But then my Mom is there and she's calling her boyfriend's parents Mom and Dad, which I find a little weird, but whatever. So [indiscernible at 00:43:32] time to me like it's weird because it's like the brother's are my age but yet she's kind of like the Grandma.</p>

<p>I mean they are very nice people and they are open, but they are really loud and obnoxious and they swear. They are not classy and they are just not my type of people. But my Mom is constantly is like well she signs all of her e-mails and any text with the guy and I love you. Which, I don't know it just really bothers me. So I really ask for her to stop. And I don't think she understood why I found it annoying.</p>

<p>[00:44:08]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Did he grown up in that house?</p>

<p>CLIENT: He grew up in that house there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So he never left?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Never left.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Wow. And your Mother lives there?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. I don't know why this bothers me so much? And I am like, she's like, I left your Dad for independence. And I am like, you owned a home and had your own life and now you moved in with your boyfriend's family. And they have no desire to leave. Like they didn't have privacy. It's like go down the hallway to my Mom's room, the brother's room and the Master Bedroom with the parents.</p>

<p>And it's like – I don't know. It's almost like they are little children in the house. It's very odd. But the we love you thing really, really bothers me. So I finally had to say something about it and she was just what if he does? And we will let you know. But I'm like I don't think he really loves me Momma, like he doesn't really know me and I don't know. It just makes me.</p>

<p>[00:45:13]</p>

<p>That's like no one says like I love you to me beside like parents and not [indiscernible at 00:45:21] I don't know it just feels like it's strange to have this strange man, the vey lose term for like saying that all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Stranger to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So. And them thinking like well that was just my you know my cynical side in and I'm like did you say it because you just want to say it? Do you really love me? Because you really don't know me and if could have knew how please I don't think you really love me.</p>

<p>But, yeah I just wondered why in the world you say that? I don't feel like that warm and fuzzy where you think of me as your kid.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I thought maybe you are his sister?</p>

<p>[00:46:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I don't even spend a lot of time there. I mean I spend the holidays, birthdays, couple of cookout during the summer. I mean in the last two or three, this would have been five years spend the holidays with them?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: They have seen me maybe four or five times a year for a couple of hours at a time. So I don't think that is that much time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You know we actually are going to stop today. OK. So I will see you tomorrow.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, I couldn't open the attachments for the bill?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. I can send it to you again.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I will give you a check tomorrow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Ok.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Great.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: OK. Great. Take care.</p>

<p>CLIENT: 7:15, right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: 7:15.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I've got it. Bye, bye.</p>
