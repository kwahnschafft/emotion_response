<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>

<p>The following transcript was provided by The American Academy of Psychotherapists. AAP was founded in 1954 as a multidisciplinary group of committed therapists who promote the art and science of psychotherapy.  AAP is dedicated to fostering the development of the therapist at all levels, from graduate students to seasoned veterans. Over the years, AAP developed a series of recorded sessions, where well-known therapists provided examples of their particular brand of therapy.</p>

<p>Dr. Ira Progoff, (1921-1998), is best known for his development of an intensive journal-writing method he developed as a way to encourage personal growth. Dr. Progoff received a PhD in Psychology from New School for Social Research in New York City in 1951 and, in the following few years, studied with Carl Jung in Switzerland. Dr. Progoff's  main interest was in depth psychology and particularly the humanistic adaptation of Jungian ideas to the lives of ordinary people. He founded Dialogue House in New York City to help promote this method.</p>

<p>Dr. Progoff discussed his theories of depth psychology and related subjects in 14 books, starting in the 1950's with a series of psychological workbooks. He emphasized the spiritual and creative potentials of personality. "Each human life," he wrote, "has the potentiality of becoming an art work."</p>

<p>This transcript is a session with Dr. Progoff and a client.</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, now we have lots of things to do today.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Real work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hum?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Work actually.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Work.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right, work. Less talk and more work. And some of the things to be done are some dreams that have been sort of piling up that we haven't - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...looked at. And you want to read it, or do you want me to read it?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No you read it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This dates from the morning of April the 7th and I start out by saying "I woke with these remembered sequences. I seem to be driving in an automobile in which there are some women passengers, possibly my mother and sister, but I'm not sure of that. At any rate it is a very similar situation to real life in that when I was living at home we very often use to drive around, you know, drive through the countryside, you know, on a pleasure short pleasure drive." [0:01:05.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "And this is similar to that. So we're driving along a rural road in the countryside very much like that of the county where I grew up. I remark about the beautiful sunset and especially how bright the stars are. I can see them spread out over the evening sky and twinkling brilliantly. There remains enough daylight to see everything clearly, however. We pass a beautiful old country house all white and set among tall green trees at the crest of a hill. The terrain falls away in front of it in a broad green slope that gives a broad and beautiful view. I am captivated by it and say with much enthusiasm, "You know if I couldn't have a house on a bluff overlooking the Missouri River I would like to have one just like this on the top of a hill with this broad sweep of country before it". </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "A woman to whom I have said this answers with some impatience but not really irritated, "Yes I know I know you don't have to explain". As we drive along past the house I see where the banks of the roadside have been somewhat eroded so that the roots of the trees are exposed here and there. We turn in at an entrance to another house similar to the first one and get out to visit the woman who lives there. We have a little dog with us who growls and shows its teeth when we are out of the car. While waiting for the woman who lives there to come to the door, I try to stop the little dog's unfriendly behavior. And the way that I do that is I seem to have a flat piece of paper, it's almost as though it were one of these drawings wrapped up in brown paper, the way I bring them over here." [0:02:56.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "And I, the little dog is standing beside me facing toward the house. I put the piece of paper down in front of it as though to block it from its objectivity" - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - "which is directed toward the house, that's the way I try to stop its behavior."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "It finally looks up at me and says, ‘that's all right let me show my teeth I'm just establishing my right to be here'".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: The dog says?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. "Because there's a little dog in the house who will try to intimidate me if I don't take self, take a self-confident attitude." [0:03:36.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "Now the woman with her little dog - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because the little dog will intimidate him he says if he.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, uh-huh, there's another little dog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In that house, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh, in the house that we are approaching.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This little dog as much as to say, you know, this is just a pose I'm taking don't - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...take it so seriously.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because if I don't take this, this dog that we're going to visit is going to lord it over me or, you know - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...make me back down so I have to act this way. So just let me go ahead, you know, it's all right. [0:04:10.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. So </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, we'll come back to that but that find.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, because that's I thought that was something that we want to talk about.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure because the dog, the dog is no small symbol in the context of your dream.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. So we're waiting for this woman to come to the door and "she does come to the door and opens it and her little dog does come out and she's barking, but as I walk toward it, that is the host dog, it retreats a few steps and then turns around and barks some more. I feel somewhat timid about advancing toward it for fear that it will nip my ankles. Not really afraid, you know, but just a little cautious about it. But remembering what my dog said, I walk toward it with an air at least of assurance and it always retreat, runs back a few steps" - [0:05:15.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: - "turns around and barks some more. I keep walking very steadily toward it."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "It retreats again."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Each time?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Each time you walk toward it retreats?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it's the woman's dog?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, uh-huh. "And during that process we actually enter the house and get to a room where we are about to sit down, you know, everybody is taking a seat."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the way the dream closes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Who is everybody now?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well there beside you see they weren't identified, but I have the feeling that it was my mother and sister with me or some a woman or two women with me in this car.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In the car with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we stopped to visit a friend. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Who herself is an elderly woman, older woman.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All this does seem to take place back home?</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the setting all right. And the elements of the dream really are things that date from back home because this viewing of those beautiful houses - [0:06:16.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...you know, really in a very peaceful and oh typical - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...rural setting, are things that have appealed to me from ever since when I use to live out there as a matter of fact. And I very often have admired and even painted some of those old houses.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. But it's to say these are places where you say that this is the kind of house that you would like?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Expecting, of course, that in the dream the house would have another meaning as well.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I mean the atmosphere and the elements really seem to come from a life situation. [0:07:05.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Which is back there in adolescence.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. And now at the end of the dream it does seem to be your mother and sister, you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No more so then at first. As a matter of fact there was less of them in the end of the dream then in the early part when we were driving along and I saw the beautiful sunset and the stars out, then I seemed to feel that I was in the car with my mother and sister and that's a repeat, repeated figure, you know - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, of course.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...that always is there.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: This other woman is she a friend of theirs?</p>

<p>CLIENT: She holds the position of somebody that we know and have known a long while.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And in a drive through the country we might just stop in and say hello to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Actually in the dream she was nobody that I really knew and even as we drove up to the house she seemed somewhat to be a stranger to me. [0:08:04.3]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that, you know, is that sort of paradoxical but that's the way it was. We stopped as though stopping to see a friend of long standing.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe a family friend, you know, and yet I didn't seem to know who it was.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, what do you think about that?</p>

<p>CLIENT: It makes me think that's it as in many recent dreams as shift in (inaudible - 0:08:33.5) figures.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: She would belong to the group of personages that represent a new one, you know, or transition.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, either she would represent a new one or since she seems to be known by your mother and sister it may be that she's an old one whom you don't recognize any more.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because at this - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, that's our situation all right. [0:09:03.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. In other words at this point in the process where we have come this far that the, how should we say, that the whole feminine side of your self, this whole kind of possession by the feminine that this is something that is really from which you have pretty much freed yourself and that now that you come here at this point in the work you come to this old expression of the feminine which has somehow possessed so much of your psychic up to now, now at this point you are so far away from that, that you don't even remember. Only this, the dog, her dog, you take the attitude toward that dog and each time you take quite a strong masculine attitude and each time you take a masculine attitude the dog retreats. [0:10:14.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: This situation was pictured in a dream of several months ago in that incidence it was I discovered an unused room in my house and I thought that, it appeared to me the one room, if I opened up that room and used it as a part of my apartment, but I would have to pay more rent would the landlady charge me more rent? Well, thereupon the landlady appeared in the dream and she had a little cat with her.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I had a little cat with me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And as I entered the room the two cats were antagonist and the landlady's cat drove my cat away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Whereas in this dream we now have dogs. [0:11:03.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And my dog says let me take a stand against this and I myself take as you say a more active, aggressive, masculine stand and make the others retreat. Which to me seems to be a continuation of that same situation or just what you've described.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Also, this current dream, you see just prior to this episode we passed some exposed roots along the side of the road which would seem somehow, I tried to figure those out what kind of roots they were, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I figured they were roots from my background.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: From way back there which the whole dream pictured and it could very well be that that was one of the aspects of the roots.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Something you said also about the ground there being eroded. [0:12:02.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what exposed the roots.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. That which would mean really that that part of your life had been eroded and had laid bare the roots, you see, and it was as though that part of your life had now, had been negated really. And now your dog, the dog speaking, how did that seem in the dream?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Perfectly natural.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Perfectly sensible?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I heard, you know, dogs have spoken to me quite a lot at times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. Well, I think this dog we would take somehow as quite a personal essence of you, couldn't we? I mean we've had dog in the sense of the Hounds of Heaven.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But always somehow representing something very intimate. [0:13:05.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, always yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Spiritual essential.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And I would take your dog to represent there is something true of you in principal. Maybe, yeah in a sense as though the dog represents you can almost say your soul, your sort of basic nature, not animal nature but basic nature. And he speaks with an awareness of the situation ahead of time really I mean he says, but what did he say when -</p>

<p>CLIENT: When I try to stop him?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: He looks up and says "that's all right let me show my teeth".</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Those are the extra words up to that point. [0:14:03.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: "Let me show my teeth".</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: From then on he continued and I paraphrased because I didn't remember the exact words but the idea was I'm just establishing my right to be here because there's a little dog in the house we will try to intimidate me if I don't take a self-confident attitude.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. So that would mean he's really here as a newcomer?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's typical really of dogs nature, you know, how they defend their own when they're at home - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...on their own property - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...they defend it - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...in all sorts of ways. But a dog that comes from the outside is on the defensive - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...always. And he has to establish himself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: If he's going to cross the line.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, yes he has to, he's on the defensive sort of aggressively though he has to he has something, he has to establish a new right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, in this sense then the dog represents the new self that has been coming into being. [0:15:06.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I would say so yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. And the feeling is that this could be lost if he doesn't establish his right to exist in an affirmative way even in an aggressive way by bearing his teeth. And that if he does take a strong masculine, affirmative attitude he will establish his right to be there, otherwise he will not and then the next part of the dream really has you carrying on the work for him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's true, it's as though he and I participate in the same action.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's as though you and the dog are extensions of each other - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...which would be the feeling, you see, that the dog somehow represents your essential being and you yourself represent the outer side of yourself, the side that actually does the activities that are necessary in order to fulfill what is necessary for the essence of yourself as expressed in the dog. And so you do it, it really does sound as though this is carrying the process further on. I think it also expresses something we have had in the last two, three sessions namely a certain bearing of teeth. [0:16:28.0]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, you see this dates from the 7th of April.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, I see, yeah, that's right. So that really indicates the, actually it's just as well that we had the discussions that we did and didn't get onto this dream because what we did was have a (inaudible - 0:16:43.2) instead of a dream about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just like.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Except that I had the advantage on you in that I had had the dream.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right you did.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Do you see any significance in the fact that the earlier dream used cats as extensions and this one used dogs? [0:17:11.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think the only thought I would have on that is that for you dogs are a much stronger symbol then cats. The dogs, I don't think you could have cat as a symbol for your basic self that wouldn't fit in your context. If its cat it had to end up negative, it did didn't it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think cat would not be a strongly affirmative image for you in the context of your dreams, I mean it might be for somebody else but it wouldn't be for, you think?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No when they have appeared before I never have felt the kind of affirmation that this dream with the dog carries. [0:18:12.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or other dogs.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Other dog dreams. Therefore, I would think that the fact that it was a cat dream meant it wasn't quite ready to have an affirmative outcome and that's just the way the dream was.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It acted though as a source of carrot, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Something to work toward.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. Well, it - </p>

<p>CLIENT: That was very impressive in that way.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...show the thing in process, yes, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Here is one from two days later on the 9th. "I saw what looked like a white canvass or perhaps a piece of paper about the size of an ordinary painting. On it were sketched in the main lines or preliminary drawing in preparation for a painting. It seemed to be a sort of flower pot and the long straggly stems of a plant. I was examining them very closely and much interested in one line that curved in a big loop. I was very interested to see if it actually touched another of the lines but decided that it didn't." Now the feeling that I had when I recalled this dream was that it was a sketch - [0:19:32.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or a preliminary laying in of a painting and that the main lines were somehow sketched in, drawn in.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And what they needed was to be filled out or to be developed - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...or carried on further in steps to make this a real work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>CLIENT: What they or what they actually information they carry I don't know, I don't know what they had, you know, if any. But they really were quite definite in a certain kind of shape. [0:20:16.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like this.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes and I examined them with great interest.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh and you say here that when you looked at the image the lines reminded you of the lines in your palm.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes later, you know, later in the day as I thought about that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. You've never had an interest in palm reading, have you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Just the, you know, a cursory kind that, I never have gone in for it, you know, or studied it or had any kind of a reading of my palm.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Why would you have a strong feeling about this in anyway? Because I take this really again as a preparatory image as you say like a preliminary drawing in preparation for a painting which would certainly wouldn't it express sort of way you've been this past week or two? [0:21:32.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, in preparation. Let's see the next one about the keys.</p>

<p>CLIENT: "I saw one or more keys rather like the keys to my car. They were not complete in their shape but I seemed aware that they would still work to open whatever lock they belonged to. As I woke up I realized that I thought they were in bed with me and had slipped down into the depression that my body made in the mattress, and I was still anxiously trying to locate them or it when I came to and realized where I was." You know actually, I actually was sort of feeling around the bed post to try to see if I couldn't locate that key. [0:22:15.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was really after it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because it was necessary, you know, it really was quite desirable that I find that key.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, why?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh who knows why, I mean I can think of a thousand reasons now but in the dream there wasn't any reason.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, I mean why were you dreaming it? As it was the key, there was a dream to your, the keys to your car?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or yes or similar and they had been somehow they weren't complete keys as though part of them had been worn away or filed away but they still would work - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...all right. They weren't ruined that sort of disturbed me because I thought if this is a key that I care, that I have - [0:23:06.5]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...it's part of my possession. Something is being, happening to it, you know, - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...I mean, you know, eroded by time or use or not used.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What do you think that might have been? Have any idea what that might have been?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not specifically it just seems to me that what is the key, the key is to get united with this real creative self.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And that's already in my possession.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That I, that's there and it's nothing I have to acquire in other words.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But just find it - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and it will work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Will open.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, but isn't there the sense in that, that you have the keys?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: In other words they're not really - </p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't know them, but I don't know it, that's the sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But you had them, you seen them. [0:24:07.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just you dropped them and they're in your bed somewhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: All right. The question that was bothering you was why they were eroded a bit - </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: ...filed away? I think that might have a sense that you see that perhaps a month or two ago you had more a sense of assuredness that you did have the whole key brand new.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's funny, now I feel more, maybe not at the time of the dream but right now - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...as feel more as though I had the key than then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, well, but you had that dream about eight or ten days ago.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that would be at a time when you would have the feeling when you were somehow at that time you were in sort of a (inaudible - 0:24:52.6) where you felt you had it and you had the capacity for all this creative activity that you've already begun, but somehow it's a time of being in-between and you've had this feeling of things working around inside you in a preparatory way again. And that would be perhaps oh that something of a key that you had had worn off. [0:25:19.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: One of the earliest dreams I ever had was of keys, I had the key in my pocket - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...to my car and I wanted to get away and get in the car and go.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I couldn't get them out of my pocket somehow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So that that key was really from the very start.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Part of the equipment.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Now it comes in again and it seems, you know, not to be whole that's what bothered me, it wasn't a complete key - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...but it would still work.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. In other words even at the time when you were feeling in the (inaudible - 0:25:55.0) even then it was still there enough.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: It was, so that even, even two weeks ago even in the lower time you still had the sense of the power and the ability was there. Then how did it seem to be lost? How come that it was lost? [0:26:39.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It wasn't so much that it was lost as though I couldn't get my hands on it. In the dream I never really held the key in my hand I just sort of saw the key.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yes. Oh yes so really you didn't have it but you felt it was around?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I saw it first.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And that's when you -</p>

<p>CLIENT: You see in my vision - </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: ...and then it seemed to develop actually it took you might say a more concrete form in that instead of just being an image it became a something real that was next to me and I was actually physically trying to pick it up. [0:27:12.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh, yeah. And -</p>

<p>CLIENT: Not knowing exactly where to put my hands on it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. Feeling as though it was right within your grasp?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Uh-huh. And I think we can only add then the other remark though about your feeling that you have right now of being all the more sure now that just for the fact that it has been worn thin in certain parts that it will work better perhaps like well aren't there people who put a little bit of sandpaper on the keys to make them more sensitive and more versatile? [0:27:53.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To open more locks then just one and that somehow has happened.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know if it's the result of this dream but probably a result of the process that is going on and the dream is a part. But I can allow that I'm so sure the key's there that I'm not even worried about looking for it, I have this frantic search for it you know. [0:28:25.3]</p>

<p>T: You know it's interesting you've had the dream the Hounds of Heaven come up in your material. In the earlier session, this woman had an image of Virgin Mary that had first been very clear and beautiful and then she saw it as charred. And she thought oh this was sort of impure now and should be thrown away. That was the first impulse. The second feeling was oh no this is better this way as far as being charred. And then she reminded herself of a line from the Hounds of Heaven where there's something about where he says, "Why have you had to char me?" "Why have you had to char this wood before you could write with it?" he says of God. You see. "Why have you had to char this wood before you could write with it?" and yet he realizes of course this had to happen. And that's just the way it is. The key has to be ground down, has to be made imperfect in order to be made more sense of it; in order to open more locks. [0:29:50.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: There was another thing that really isn't pertinent to this particular thing but it's been in my mind from time to time and that is what does the word Caleb mean to you? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Caleb.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Dog? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, C-A-L-E-B?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh-huh. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, that's the man in the bible.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, but I mean what does the name mean. It has the meaning of dog.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does it? I don't know. In Hebrew?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It might. I don't know. It might in the special kind of interpretations that he has. Oh, I saw him Monday night. I saw several other people who were at the class. Were you at the class that night? </p>

<p>CLIENT: Uh huh. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Said he was taking my name in vane a number of times.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, well alright. You seem to be crossing his mind several times.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Every time he would go for an illustration, there you would be. [0:31:04.7] </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. Yes, that's what he said. When he came he said he really had to get back home early that evening but he knew I was going to be over meeting some of the people there so he came over. His greeting was I've been treating for you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He said parenthetically that when somebody crosses your mind like this, or just pops into your thought with no apparent reason, it's a good thing to just bless them. The idea comes by so you got two Monday night. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's what he meant, yes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I thought at the time one reason you might be coming into his mind was that I was questioning him very closely, and listening, and very intent. I was practically putting the eye on him as he spoke and the things that he was saying I was testing with things that I was thinking and we have talked about. And it wasn't odd for me to hear him bring you up because it was almost-. [0:32:06.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It's as though you were being a kind of medium for us. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Or he was picking up the intensity of my listening to him and sending out an answer. I wouldn't try to defend that in court but it was certainly right in line with my thinking when he named you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And the things that he said spoke to the questions that you had in mind. Yeah, he did seem to be thinking of me but maybe also the subject that he was on is something that we worked on quite a bit when we did the seminar together. </p>

<p>CLIENT: He has a very interesting view of subconscious. It was the book of Job that he was dealing with and he's speaking of Leviathan being the monster of the deep. [0:33:04.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Now he says subconscious is that mind that some people call the dum-de-dum, it just drums on the table and doesn't like to be turned from its habitual way. And if you take a conscious stand, it follows. Well that would almost seem to be the exact opposite from what my idea is in that the conscious mind really is supported by the subconscious and that the changes that come in the subconscious are reflected then in the conscious mind. And just by taking a conscious is not necessarily going to deflect the subconscious. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure. That's the whole question, that whole type of religious thinking of whether you can determine and control the unconscious by conscious affirmations. And part of the point that I try to make when I talk to those people is that you have to find the way of drawing from the unconscious what is authentically there and let that set the pattern for what you will unfold. As our question would be, what the seed is. That the seed is what is growing in the unconscious. [0:34:23.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And you see they're on difficult ground because they contradict themselves. He will say in the next breath that really the ultimate and the deepest kind of a concern you can have consciously is to be in harmony with the (inaudible at 0:34:37.4).</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. And in another breath he takes the unconscious virtually as God, as the human form of divine order in the metaphysical framework, but that's their special problem. You know my feeling there that is moving more in our direction here really and maybe in that way also we were drawing his mind that night. I do have the feeling that he would come much more in this direction if the structural framework of his church would permit it. And some day soon maybe that will be more possible. [0:35:31.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I see evidences of it in his own thinking. Very often just a here and there without any-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I'm sure that when I did that seminar with him that he was a person I influenced more than anyone else. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, undoubtedly. I could easily believe that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean that of all the people there the one who understood the most and with whom there was a real dialogue was him himself. And the followers in the church, they were more or less saying yes to me I think not because they really understood but because he seemed to like me. That was my feeling. [0:36:17.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Then April 12th I awoke with this fragment, I seem to see a youngish woman who has just donned some different clothes and vaguely it seems to be a kind of gray skirt and blouse. She was saying over and over and with obvious satisfaction and relief, "These are the first clothes I've ever had that really fit me." She didn't mean that they fit tight or snug but they were just right. They fit her. There seemed to be a young man there too who was supposed to change his clothes for some new ones but he seemed too shy to change in public; that is with the others of us who were present looking on. [0:37:00.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now who was this girl?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Upon awaking the girl seemed to remind me of who was first woman outside my family, my mother or sister, that I'd had any kind of a close relationship with. She was my piano instructor and we used to have long talks and the kind of sessions that a teenager would want to have with a little bit older person. She was maybe five or six years older than I. But of course, I'd already graduated from college and was a very intuitive type of self. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: She was a woman, sensitive, and with you at a point where you were both growing and then around a creative situation. [0:38:08.6]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That was a great aspiration, a great new world opening up, and she sort of represented that to me as I recall because she had contacts with people whom I didn't know but to whom she introduced me who were already doing things that I hoped to do later; that is either artists, or musicians, or writer in other words, her college group that she had just recently been in school with. And I think I felt a little flattered and my ego was probably flattered in that they would treat me as a contemporary when I would see these people from time to time. So that it really was kind of my first contact with the world that I had aspired to without any real concrete knowledge of for her. [0:39:10.6]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Now then in that case we could take her here as expressing the aspiring soul. And if this is the first time that the clothes fit right, then I would take it that this is the first time that something in its outer form has really fit and seemed adequate for your basic aspiration. I think we could take her then you see not so much as soul in itself but as aspiring soul. The seed imagine, the inner subjective aspiration, and the clothes for the first time they fit. So for the first time you now have a feeling of having your hands on and having in your possession something that is adequate. As you remember as we used to have it in the months past as we'd say well there'd been points and I think you mentioned the other day that you'd been thinking about this. That there were different points where you could've said yes and stopped and said, "Well now I've achieved enough." And yet it seemed at those points, no, that there was something more that you needed, something more that you felt subjectively, that you felt was essential for your full expression of being. You couldn't stop here. You had to go on and ultimately felt really well you couldn't ever have stuff at any point other than this one now where now for the first time the clothes seem really to fit. And then well what's the next thing? That shy young man, he hasn't quite put them on, the clothing that he has, this again is a dream of a week and a half ago. This is a dream of when you were in that trough and that feeling of things almost being ready, not quite being ready. So you have the clothes that fit but not quite the courage to put them on. And yet somehow in the dream just before there where the dog shows his teeth and you take the strong affirmative attitude toward the other dog, there is the sense that that strength is present. [0:41:52.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: In the past few days the form that that has taken in my thinking is this, I'm gradually becoming aware that maybe things have changed to the point where I don't have to worry with a backward look over my shoulder to see that something is after me. Maybe I can really take a deep breath and say, ok I'm really go-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you mean you don't have to be Lot's wife anymore?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I don't have to worry about sitting something- </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should have a drink for that because what a thing that means. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. You see that's why I said earlier that I feel so confident that I have the key now that I don't have to worry about fumbling for it. Just go ahead, I'm using it whether I can see it or not that's the point.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well you know we had this discussion didn't we that really that took up so much time last week, last two or three sessions, about the nature of the river that we talked about and about all these different paintings, and whether these paintings are an artwork, or are just an overflowing and the sense is really through all of it this is the fact of the process. There's nothing else but the process. And when you really have that sense that this process, the river, is flowing on, that all the things that you've done so far are small compared with what is potential, and the power, and the momentum that it generates through the process in the river. Therefore this all moving onward is what carries it forward. [0:43:53.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think of it more as a road really to tell you the truth. I don't know if it makes any difference but I really had quite a tussle. There was a real time there where I had to come to grips with myself and I really formed some conclusions of my own and one of them was about Sadafa (sp?). And I concluded that the fallacy in that word was that he unconsciously included the oriental fallacy and he wound up with his hero at the bank of this river as a ferryman. Now the very meaning of the ferryman is to send forth somebody across the river to the other side. It seemed to mean that his idea carried out logically would be that there would be this bank at the side of the river that would just be crowded with ferryman none of them knowing what was on the other side. [0:44:56.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Anyway if they knew what was on the other side, not go anywhere.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. Whereas I thought it seemed to me that we come to consciousness after having fulfilled an unconscious evolution up to a certain stage as though we came awake and we're on a road. Now that can be so overwhelming when you see that consciousness that in a way we might desire to join it immediately and jump right in the river which to me would be turning around and going back into the river, into the source. But there's another way which shows at the far end of that road a kind of glow at the horizon that is so attractive and makes one so curious about it that one will undertake the journey there even though hardship or uncertainty is involved and you might even have to build your own road to get there. Now that is the way that I phrased the difference between the eastern and the western approach. [0:46:04.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well that's fine. That's really quite in line with the thing that I was saying when I spoke at community church when we talked about this theme about the next step in religion. That is this fact that in the western way of religious experience, there is first a passive quietness in meditation or contemplation but that that is not all in the west though it is more or less all in the east. That there is in the western way a necessary active step which gets one back out into the world and not remaining simply as the ferryman taking people across the same old river and remaining there in quiet. But there is the step out into the world or if you like to cross the river and continue the path or to get into the river and go on with the river and does it not pain you over there to be one with the river. That would be in accord I think with your image more than the Sadafa (sp?) image. Yes, I agree with that. [0:47:10.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't see being at one with the river somehow.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well being in and of it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In and of it, connected and dropping in from time to time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. Yung likes to tell the story of Kwan Se who drops in the river whistling and he's washed along the way, and then gets out, and continues on his way.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the way I like to think of it too. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Just sort of go in, carry a little further, it's a quick way down. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I like to think whatever this action is it's actually serving to further an evolutionary process. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: In yourself?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. No, of cosmic creation. And if I were to join them you see, get in the river; I stymie its own development, whereas if I take it upon myself to represent a concrete or specialization of that, I'm furthering the process. [0:48:17.4]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then to be in it and out of it both.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Connected with it and expressing it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Giving it a chance to express itself.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Which to me is a good deal more valuable than just rejoining it. You see that's where the distinction is. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, your feeling is that being in the river means a melting of self.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, uh huh. Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: My feeling is that the melting of self into the river is the first stage. As a matter of fact, that you have experienced that in the time when you had these many deep dreams and the time that we spoke of the other day that when the feeling was that what was real was not the outer world but this whole inner world of great mythological kinds of symbols that we had in the dreams. And the whole level of your experience was something other than your personal being really. And then we went into that and we were living in that for a while. And then when you came out of that, then you could become your own self, then you could paint in a new way and you could feel in a new way. [0:49:41.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: What it actually did, you see, was to open up a channel or a connection with that that had been completely a closed book before.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what was the channel? That meant getting into the river but not forever staying in the river. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well that's right. You could even say from that point of view then that the river is within me; I contain the river. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes. You contain the river but the river also contains you since it is somehow life, sense it is somehow cosmos. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, from a larger point of view. [0:50:11.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if you speak as you do, or feeling yourself part of some larger evolution in the world, some larger evolution that is meaning in and of itself and in more than in your personal or my personal life, now that would be that river which is there before you came and which goes on after you go. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You see. Now to go into that river means to be dissolved in that river and then with something of the river in you, somehow to reemerge the same person but different. The Hindu's have many stories on this of going in and coming out the same person but different as though something of the river now is in you. It always was in you but when you've gone into the river, the river in you somehow expresses itself in still another way. But then the one important thing is that then your connection to the ongoing enfoldment of life is felt. This is where the experience enlarges itself beyond merely personal or subjective experience becomes connection to life as a whole. [0:51:41.5]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well this is where an artist has a role to play then.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Absolutely, where an artist has a role to play. Of course, he has a role to play partly as a medium, as one who connects others to which he has connected himself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well naturally if he serves as the instrument for this ongoing of the river and makes it a concrete reality in the world that he lives in, it will have to have some affect on everything else that goes on in the world. All the people who see this work will have to be affected one way or the other in that they either get something from it or they don't. And each one of those to me is a fact with some consequences. [0:52:45.2]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Here the way you experience the role of the artist, that is to say your own role as artist, in the ongoing development of life for other people. There immediately you find for yourself a very specific sense of connection to the continuing evolution of life. It becomes then very specific the role of the artist and the possibility of your being the one to live the role. [0:53:19.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's why that image that you have up there of the artist- I decided to switch that picture around so it would be right over there because to me somehow that typifies the whole development that has taken place in you. That old artist that you saw really as embodying the seed of possibility in yourself that you saw before it was real, before you could use the key, before you even really had the key. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's always been a very interesting point to me in that one who couldn't use the key, didn't see what it was, could have an intuitive knowledge that it exists which shows up in this. [0:54:09.8]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. That's this whole thing of if the oak tree had a dream it would be a dream of the acorn that it would know nothing about but which it somehow contains. And somehow that wise old artist man whom you've painted, you knew him somehow before he existed as reality. And even now he exists and he does not exist for you're not the wise old artist. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, no he does exist. He's specific really. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: He is specific. Yes, how? </p>

<p>CLIENT: He came along at one of the stages when I was so wrapped up with Cézanne and he really is Cézanne but he's more than Cézanne and the same thing that operated in Cézanne can operate in me. [0:55:04.9]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that's the point. Well then you might say he is the principle of the evolving artist in you or in Cézanne. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Or whomever in any era. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well he is the essence of the artist. I like the dynatype that is that principle of the artist that is there before the fact of the particular artist. He's the seed of the artist, the artist in principle then to unfold in this form or that form depending on time and place and all special things. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. That's one of the characteristics of this drawing is that it is absolutely simple. It doesn't particularize anything. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: This is as true for ancient China as is it true for 19th century America as it will be for 25th century China. And the sense of this kind of painting is just that there is a being who is present and real in you who is as you say, he is true, he is present and who is- [0:56:46.2]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well in a way what he does is symbolize the fact of an artist's existence or life that he is an instrument that is in contact with the source of light and it's his life to live that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's right. And therefore, when you say he is present, though the wise old artist is not yet here, yet he is present in each of the events that have been taking place in you these last many months; a part of him. [0:57:26.7]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, yeah. Sure. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: That part of him that is necessary before he becomes the old artist he first lives through all these stages of growth. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Sure. He has his blue period, his pink period, and whatever period but they are all part of the building of the road or the flowing of the stream however you want it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Or if we think of him as a seed image.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, the unfolding.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Part of that whole unfolding. Yes. Well that's sense; the feeling of the reality of the unfolding. That sense of an inner process that works within one and shows itself externally in a variety of forms. And yet, really if you look at it from the outside, you see all these different forms that are outside. When you feel it from the inside, you feel it continuing cohering principles; something that holds it together. [0:58:30.4]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think of it as purpose. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is present and the purpose is just what is in that painting there. That's why I feel that is somehow expressing the whole thing because at every point of the road, if you ever forgot who you are, you have that painting to remind you. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's exactly it. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you ever forget your identity, you can always remind yourself of what and who your identity is. It is that wise old artist who is coming into being. And so really your true identity is someone who does not yet exist but its all the more true because it does not yet exist but is actually living, unfolding, making its existence real bit by bit through all the images, and through all the paintings, and through all the involvement and concern in the paintings, and all that is involved in being the artist. That's why the key is there. [0:59:36.8]</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's the hardest thing you see and that is the key really is to get to that point where you can accept that and try to make it conform to your preconceptions. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well to get to the point where you can just express it as you say. And I like what you said though earlier, it seemed very important, that you came to the point I guess since our last session where you could feel you don't have to look over your shoulder.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's a big statement. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I would say that but the way I would phrase it was that the idea came to me, am I at that stage? [1:00:16.1]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Could it be? Is this why I don't feel this acute anxiety any longer? Is this why I'm not feeling chased, that is-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: C-H-A-S-E-D. </p>

<p>CLIENT: That's right. (chuckles) Could it be that I've gotten over that hump and am really in a position to move on? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I shouldn't be surprised. </p>

<p>CLIENT: This trip has a great deal to do with all this.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well the fact that you have this trip ahead of you, I think does serve to crystallize a great deal. As we've encountered this kind of thing before, a trip when you had to go away that somehow crystallized things in your own feelings. But I think the trip comes at the right time now. [1:01:16.1]</p>

<p>CLIENT: The reason that I said I thought the trip had something to do with it was that when I first learned that I was to be gone for that length of time out there, I looked on it very favorably. I thought this is grand. This is just like a new beginning. It pulls me out of everything here in New York, giving up the apartment, closing everything out, putting everything in storage, and going out there. With a certain sense of certainty you know that I'll be there a certain length of time. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: At a minimum.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes. And I can recall the influences that were very positive out there last time. I'm really looking for to those again. I really do look forward to this as a matter of fact. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yes, indeed. Very good sir. (chuckles) [1:02:15.4]</p>
