<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, we had our last and the first very session on [DATE] which is about, just about 10 days ago, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And that's the time I diagnosed that you have what we call major depression, and I gave you Wellbutrin 150 mg in the morning and Restoril or temazepam 15 mg at bedtime if needed basis.  Have you taken the Wellbutrin every day since then?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And how about the Restoril, the sleeping pill?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not every day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Were you able to sleep without the Restoril?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Fair.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So then if you are not having good sleep, what's the reason you are avoiding the Restoril?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know, that's a good question.  Probably just trying to do it somewhat on my own.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now, I, I think I mentioned that at the initial phases you might allow the medications to do the job so that you're physically and mentally really rested and I really didn't want to take any chance at the initial phase.  Say 6 months to a year from now I might say sir, try to cut down the sleeping pill or maybe 6 weeks from now—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It depends on how you do.  Anyway, um, with or without the sleeping pill with the Wellbutrin every day on board, how many hours of sleep are you getting?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Six, 7.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And are these sleep pretty restful that you are getting enough sleep, uh, rest?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not real restful, no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What, what, what's stopping you from getting the rest, is it the memory of your son again or something else?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	All the past.  It's just dealing with the past, not letting the past go, like I think anyway.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Now anything happened particularly last weekend that sounded like you kind of landed in the hospital in a crisis and we were ready to put you in the hospital and [NAME OTHER] had several contact with you all through all the day yesterday.  Fill me up, what was going on with your mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There's a lot of hopeless feeling.  I feel like I just can't see any hope in the future.  Uh, that a lot of it's just hopeless feeling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hopeless against what?  That this is what I want to get and I don't think I'm going to get it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, hopeless against happiness, success.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Success in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Pardon me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Success in what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What, financially, mentally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you struggling financially now?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, yeah because I just kind of, I did several foolish things.  I made several foolish moves.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I hurt myself bad financially.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, any side effects from the medications, particularly Wellbutrin?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, and I have taken Wellbutrin before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Now obviously you understand that I have had only 1 session with you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, um, I recognized, and still do, that there's nothing humanly we can do to bring your son back.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Did I recognize that?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	We all recognize it and I recognized that too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I am very, very, um, sensitive about your loss, sir.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But my job is as your psychiatrist no matter what, first I have to save your life, and then work real hard to bring in some quality and color to your life.  I will not be able to erase your pain.  Nobody can and I'm not going to brag that I'm good enough to erase of your memory.  I will not even try that, but I will try to, we will try, we need to try to do something on top of it.  Am I going to say that this is going to be a piece of cake?  No it's not.  This is going to hard.  You better believe that, but is it doable?  I think so.  When I saw you 10 days ago, I was very concerned, and I shared with you what are the risk factors you had in terms of suicide and I shared with you that I was very concerned, but that night I felt safe enough that I allowed you to go home.  Things were very different yesterday.  I was in constant touch with my nurse and I know she has made several phone calls with you and I think one of your friends and I don't know if she was able to get you in touch with your wife or not, but she did talk to one of your friends and several times with you.  So tell yourself where were you yesterday and where are you today in terms of your thinking of using the gun on yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't want to do that, but I have to get myself in a place where I can see hope.  Does that make sense to you?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does.  It does.  If you walk, if you run, if your drive, if you fly, we all have a target.  This is, we are in point A and we are trying to go to point B depending on how far, how difficult it is whether you walk, whether you drive or fly, the difference.  So we have to have a goal and I totally understand that.  And I told you, sir, I will do my level best to help you, but you have to give me my tools.  Yesterday we were this close to calling the police.  We talked and we talked and we talked.  You know that we have the power to do that, um, [INAUDIBLE] but just because we have the power, we should abuse it.  So we [INAUDIBLE] multiple times, are we there, are we there, and we use our judgment now having talked to all these people around, you know, we have, we have time that I can still see you today.  How much time do you think how much time you are spending on your business particularly during daytime?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not near enough, not much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Give me a time frame.  What time I start and which time I get done because I have something in mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, 2 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Starting at what time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Eight.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Getting done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Dropping off materials for guys and leaving, coming back.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When do you come back?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe 4:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Where?  No, when you drop off the material, after that what do you do?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, go home, do nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If I offer you some more intensive outpatient treatment, would you do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, sir.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This will be daily though, Monday through Friday, starts about 9:00, this building, but across the hall, not in my office, across the hall.  So essentially it's across the hall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And gets done about 3:00, 3:30 in the afternoon and Monday through Friday, no holidays, no weekends, no nights and the total length of the program is anywhere between 2 to 4 weeks, and I'll come and see you 3 times a week while you come 5 days a week.</p>

PT:	Do you think I can beat this with medication?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Medication and therapy.  We need both, and we need to use both very aggressively.  I cannot and will not try to beat your loss.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Beat my what?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Loss, loss of your son.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I will everything in my capacity, and I think it's doable, to beat the depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	First 2 weeks for sure, I want you to come at 9:00 and go home at 3:30 for 2 weeks.  During that time, if you make enough progress, keeping in mind that your business has to go on as well, we can do one of these three things, instead of 5 days, we can cut it down to 3 days, or instead of coming at 9:00, we can make it to 10:00 so you can drop off your supplies.  That will be after week 2, or if you get busy during daytime, you can start at 6:00 in the evening and go up to 9:00.  These are the 3 options.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But first 2 weeks, I want you to be there by 9:00 and then just schedule an activity in such a way that, uh, you will be here between 9:00 and 3:30, okay.  Tell me about your alcohol use during this crisis time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't use it at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not at all.  When you were talking about suicide yesterday in a scale of 1 to 10, one being definitely wanting to do, how close were you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One being a definite?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum, and 10 means not at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	A 5.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Anything triggered yesterday or the weekend that you took you in that area?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Nothing particular, not anything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not during any fight with your wife or anything?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And where are you on the same scale today?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would say probably a 6.  I don't, I don't want to do that, but I [INAUDIBLE] something isn't clicking right, you know.  Does that make sense?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It does.  It does.  Um, do you have any more panic attacks?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes, I have had panic attacks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How often?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	This weekend, last weekend I have them, 2 or 3.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did you do when you had those?  How did you deal with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I have a bad problem with pacing back and forth, so I was doing that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I don't know, just to deal, to calm myself down.  I start trying to talk to myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you use the relaxation tape that I gave you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, I did not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You haven't used that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Have I used it, no I haven't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You might want to try that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Before going into the pacing.  Pacing is not bad, but if you do it for too long you might get physically exhausted, okay, um, but if you put the headphone on and listen to the CD in a quiet environment, preferably lying down on the bed, it can help you relax a lot.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, in the house that you are living now, you are living with your wife, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Who else lives in the household?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Daughter.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is that the [AGE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no, no, she's not [AGE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How old is she?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She's just a baby.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Baby?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, and do you have any gun in that house?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, yeah I do have a pistol.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your friend was supposed to remove all the guns.  What happened to that?  [PHYSICIAN NAME], hi, uh—huh, I was told less then 2 hours, Uh-huh.  That was my question, Uh-huh.  Okay.  Bye bye.  Um, how come he didn't do it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, just forgot one.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Not acceptable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm asking you to trust my judgment.  I know that you have not known me for too long, but somehow you came to know about me and you came all the way to see when you did last time.  I hope I was able to give you some assurance that I'm not God, but I'm good at what I do, and I have no reason to believe that your case was a hopeless case.  If it was I would have told you right up front, but I also conveyed that you have work and that work can only be done based on trust.  I'll be asking you to do some homework that you have to do, and you'll be asking me to do some homework that I'll need to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the homework that I took it as granted as I left the office yesterday that all the guns were gone.  Sounds like that didn't happen.  Can I trust on you or do you want me to call your wife now—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To make sure that the last pistol has also left?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I'll take it out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Promise?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I will.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, and then I will like you to come to this program.  I'm going to give you the brochure.  Um, next time I [INAUDIBLE] you know, dropping off your material for building and stuff, but be there by 10:00.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Now I may be starting a new job.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What?  I mean employment or construction?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Employment.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, they're supposed to call me anytime.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Delay it at least, take at least a couple of weeks of time, sir.  I know that you are under financial pressure and I recognize that, but you also have to understand your shoulder is not very strong right this minute.  If you take too much load on that shoulder, you might succumb and fall and crash.  There's absolutely nothing wrong in recognizing that hey, I'm having some difficult time.  I'm a strong man.  I can go on.  I can do stuff, but all of us have bad times.  Look at people in [INAUDIBLE] and Corpus Christi.  This is supposed to be their peak tourist times and the hurricane is hitting them as we speak.  Do they all give up?  No, they will go through that.  It will destroy a lot of things and the [INAUDIBLE] loss will be almost $10 million, that's what they're saying.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I need to ask you a question.  Why am I doing these crazy, off the wall things?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not crazy or off the wall, sir.  You are a caring father.  You had your only son and he reached the age that he was almost a friend.  You had a decent bonding.  You didn't have any other child to displace your affection.  You didn't have any other thing that you can lean on and that scar is very deep.  Let's not deny that fact.  It's been 6 years.  We recognize that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But still he was your son.  If it was a little one, sometimes different, but he reached that age that you have some communication and you had a lot of hope, proud, pride about that time.  All of a sudden everything is gone, only child.  It's tough, but we cannot give up.  You have a wife now and a little one.  For yourself, for your new family, the pain and suffering that you are going through because the accident of your son, ask yourself do you want to inflict the same pain on your wife and your child.  Do you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, no.  I would hate to see anybody have to go through that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See that is the key that I have gone through with, and I will hate to have even my enemy go through it.  If that's what you believe, let me help you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How do I let go of things in the past?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Time is a healer, sir.  I do not have any red, green, white or black pill that can let you go and I'll be inhuman and impractical to say just forget it.  That's just not possible.  I have an [AGE] and sometimes I hear your, remember your story and I get shaken.  Oh my God.  So, I'm very emphatic to your loss and your pain, but as a physician, that's Dad speaking, but as a physician I think I have something to offer.  That's his picture.  He's [AGE].  The one on the left, Uh-huh.  Next month this time he will be gone out of [DEIDENTIFIED].  He's going to school in [DEIDENTIFIED].  I'm already panicking for empty nest syndrome.  He never left home, the first time, but we all go through it.  It's okay to cry.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just everything that I've done too.  I mean—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Don't do those things.  See, you are going through a very turmoil, hazy phase of your life.  You're a father who took over your life.  The man you are were lost and you make those decision, financial disaster and relationship and stuff, but [INAUDIBLE] and do we live in our past of glory or shame or do we march forward.  We cannot live in the past, sir.  Be it glory or sin.  We have to go forward.  We will use the past as our teacher.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Why can't I break through the past?  What is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Only that I cannot release your past, good or bad, but we have to learn how to cope with it.  I cannot do that, but you have to trust my judgment because you don't know me that well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That you can get through the past.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'll work very diligently to give you, give you more coping skills, physical rest, mental rest that you can pick up the pieces and move it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is that what causes a lot of this depression is the coping, lack of coping?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The lack of making decisions?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You made wrong choices and you are stressed.  We make a lot of wrong choices when we have loss like this, okay.  So number 1, I want you, um, start taking the, after you started the Wellbutrin, have you had any more panic attacks, more in frequency or intensity?  I heard you had panic attack last weekend, but [INAUDIBLE] before you saw me, do you believe that your frequency or the intensity of the panic attacks got worse?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, I can't, no, I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, then I'd like to double the dose of the Wellbutrin.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I want you to instead of taking 1 100 mg in the morning, I want you to take 2 100 mg, both of them goes in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a 150 I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Correct.  So there's 150 mg each.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What did I say, 100?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You did.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm sorry, each of them are 150 mg and you will take 2 of them, both of them in the morning, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the sleeping pill, I want you to take every night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Until I tell, sir, it's time to stop.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you are coming to the program at 10:00 tomorrow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're going to give me, I'm going to get a brochure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'll give it to you.  In this building just across the hall, and I'll let them know that you'll be coming.  They will do evaluation and then we'll go from there.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've been there before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, you have been there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But I want you to try it again.  I'm sorry, you mentioned that you were there for a—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A day or 2, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three days I think.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, but I'm going to just push you and push you that this time you cannot leave.  Let me do what I can do.  Hello?  Okay, all right, bye.  Uh, and because you need to have physical rest.  You cannot be physically exhausted and expect to do mentally well.  You can't do that, all right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And as you have done yesterday, if the suicidal urges come back, call me.  I told you all these factors, so I'm very concerned, but I'm trusting your judgment, that pistol needs to go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And if you have to call me anytime of the day or night, it doesn't matter.  We are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, either me or one of my associates will take your phone call.  We will not try to criticize you, demean you, prove you wrong.  If you are in crisis, it is our crisis because the day you hire me as your psychiatrist, me and my team are behind you.  Your crisis will be our crisis and you will remain one of the team.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And you think this is beatable?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It is what?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Beatable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I believed you.  I told you that it's doable.  The depression part, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, yes.  I believe that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Are we done?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I will not give you any false hope, sir, if I didn't believe in that.  I need to give you some paper.  Do you have enough Wellbutrin, uh, at home?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	To make it, uh, 2 of them in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you are taking the Restoril or the temazepam every night.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not a matter of as a when kind of thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the pistol goes today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You promised.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you start the day treatment at 10:00 tomorrow in the morning.  I'll try to stop by tomorrow itself.  I have a little bit of a crazy day tomorrow.  If I cannot do it tomorrow, definitely I will see you on Friday.  Any questions for me, sir?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I thank you for letting me record the session.</p>
