<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>PATIENT: talk about physics. Let's see where was I? Oh, there was one thing I wanted to, of course, ask you when is it that the center closes?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It closes on July the third.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well my exam is finished absolutely on June the 11th so that makes three weeks afterwards. Is it possible for us to consider two sessions a week during those weeks and one a week whatever the balance would be before the exam because I think there'll be some flux going on during that time? And maybe during the exam have no session. Is that possible?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I think so.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Okay. Well I'll figure out the logistics of it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. You figure out the logistics. Sure.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Because I think that I'm going to have a little bit more thinking to do then. Okay. Great. That sort of ties in to the first point I wanted to bring up and that's the fact that if you look at how the whole thing has progressed, it started out really distraught, well sort of, and as distraught as I was, whether it's distraught or not I don't know, and then sort of figuring a few things out. And then saying well I'm going to have to play a role, so I'm just going to have to live that, now let's play them honestly. So great. So everything seems to be settling down. However, it's not really the right way to do it because there's no way for me to check this all out you see. There's no way for me to see if I'm going to be comfortable doing that. It's just talk now and that's something that can't be avoided because of my lifestyle the way it is right now with doing a lot of studying and not... [0:01:50.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that's one of the reasons why I wanted to push this back.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: So that I can think about it and try to get out and see if that's a viable alternative to changing my life to that style. And it's pretty easy now to come to conclusions that may not be the case. The next thing, I don't want to beat the dead horse, but I want to get back to the sex thing a little bit. To see if it can just be written off, as I'm feeling, of course, much better about it, or if there's some conclusions we can draw from it? And that's sort of the part of the matter of definition that I wanted to get to. If I'm going to play roles, and instead of lying call it showing a different facet of my personality, and maybe instead of calling it something different, making it something different, having different motives for doing it, then I should really examine that personality and see just what I am. And I think that it might be possible to find out a little bit more about myself if I can find out what the motivating forces are with respect to any sexual behavior I've had. Any abnormalities if there is any such thing as an abnormality of sexual behavior. So that's one of the starts, now I don't have any plans after that. I don't know what to think about it. I suppose I should look at... Well I might as well basically discuss sexually where I'm at. When I was in high school, of course, I listened to all the crap parents hand out but nevertheless when you grow up you don't end up behaving that way. And when you get away to college of course, then not only do you feel physically one way and you behave one way, but you begin to think it's all right. So when I got away to college, about my sophomore year, that's when I really came around and realized there was nothing really bad about sex and that everyone was messing around and enjoying it. Why shouldn't I enjoy it? [0:04:25.4]</p>

<p>So in college there were several opportunities that presented themselves and I had a couple chicks... You know you'd date a chick for a year, and I'd have sexual relations with her, and things were fine. In the cases where it happened, even though I was quite young, it was only a few years ago but still I was young the way I look back in my head now, this one gnawing thing and that's (inaudible at 0:04:59.8) that while it was great, call it infatuation, whatever, when it was in its good stages, when it started to deteriorate when it really mattered to me, the three girls that mattered to me at varying stages of my development but at the time they mattered to me, that's all that matters. The thing that bothers me is the fact that when it was on the wane, and I realized it, I realized it wasn't going to go, there was still a desire to maintain the sexual aspect of it. And there seemed to be no remorse on my part for behaving that way. In other words I felt that maybe I should feel bad about it and indeed the girl often did feel bad after it was over, but I didn't. You see my sort of feeling bad took place before the termination. [0:06:02.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Your feeling bad took place when you realized it was waning away.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And yet I maintained the relationship. And I think that the reason that we dated was for sex in almost every case.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And it bothers you that you should've done that and with such...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:06:20.8).</p>

<p>PATIENT: So maybe I'm very, very sexually inclined. I don't know. I'm not talking about behavior now during any sex act, but I'm just talking about what motivates me to maintain a relationship. I can be very sentimental and very soft at times and really can succumb to words of affection that or just affection gestures and things. But when it's past, there seems to be nothing driving me except... Sex can maintain a relationship because (inaudible at 0:07:02.4) and that's not good. I mean maybe I'm more of... I know I'm screwed up. It's a fact. So with that in mind, and that's at all stages of development. That's the first na�ve little puppy love thing. And I think I'd rather not bring June into it because that one's different I think. But it seemed to be the case all the way through college. Well there was one particular case I spent my junior year, I got (inaudible at 0:07:46.1) and there was the sweetest little girl there, and we were having a great time. We loved each other and everything. I realized then that there was, she was from a different college, that there was very little hope of anything permanent ever coming out of it. But nevertheless, I didn't discourage that thought in her mind. And it then it developed to the stage where I sort of had to come out and tell her. I mean there was just no way around it. When I did, there was all this trauma and everything. And after the trauma was over we realized that there was really nothing that should change the... Well I don't know if we realized it. We concluded that there was nothing that should change the relationship between us. However, even though we felt differently about the future, the long term future, but still the day to day relationship stayed the same. And I think I really forced that conclusion merely for sexual desires. I really do. [0:08:49.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You think you kept that going just because you wanted sex with her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That case there is really bad because there was never a sweeter girl that was really an almost charming little girl. She was a physicist too; a very good one. And that was really cruel that I would do that because I was essentially lying to her. Because her notion of the reason it was sustained was because there was hope of something longer, and I sort of just wiped that out in her mind and talked her into continuing on a day to day basis. Well anyhow that just shows that I look at myself as a ratfink in many respects in that aspect. [0:09:37.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well it sounds like part of that is some kind of concern in the first place about getting somebody to go your way on some kind of basis that you feel a little guilty about.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that could be too. Do you mean then that there's a still a linger guilt way in the back? Do you mean guilt about sex or guilt about that?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Guilt about getting her to come around to your way.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know if all ties back to just guilt about sex period that was just engrained in me from age zero up. [0:10:22.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You mean that might be there too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The thing that really gets me mad is the fact that, it's taken years, but now when I talk to my parents about it, they realize what's going on. And they sort of have implied on several occasions that they didn't lead such quiet little youthful lives either. And wow did that get me mad because I think they really got me messed up.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It makes you mad that even though they led that kind of life, they tried to teach you something else.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I mean my father was 40 when he married. I mean what can say? He certainly messed around. There's no question in my mind. Well he said so. But anyhow, (inaudible at 0:11:12.8) there were a few other people that I didn't feel bad lying to. I don't even think I lied to them. There were a couple of girls that didn't mean anything more than a good time and that was the understanding. [0:11:34.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To both of you?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So it certainly wasn't very deep in those cases. But the motivation was pretty much the same. In those cases I wasn't really behaving any differently to myself just behaving completely differently to another person. I'm not talking about the good times with other girls. I'm talking about the bad times. The one that's on the wane, and I realize it. When that relationship is very similar to the shallow relationship I had with girls. However, I had to lie for one of them. I didn't have to lie for the other. When it's realized it's shallow, it's not deep, it's not going anywhere, in my head it's the same thing. I realize it's not going anywhere; I'm doing this for enjoyment sake and its all good times, big deal. However, one case I have to lie to the girl, the other case I don't. I don't have to lie, of course, now I really feel bad about it. [0:12:34.0]</p>

<p>Now we get to the last couple of years and the girth of girls around. There's three girl physicists in New York, and two of them are married, and the other one I wouldn't want to have anything to do with anyhow, so I never really meet anyone. Besides I don't have time. I don't know if it's getting old or not but I don't really right now want too much. I'm not including June in this because I just haven't got her figured out at all. Well I just can't. But anyhow the occurrence of my little "abnormality" of the fantasy didn't occur until after this stage sort of developed and it was a long time since I had really a good or bad relationship really. And this started happening and it continued to happen after I had relations with June because I don't think they were deep. I mean there was no commitment on my part. At that stage of the game there was pretty much in my mind no commitment to anyone ever. It just didn't seem to be in my future. I wasn't ready to make any kind of commitment with myself. So with June it was a little different whereas initially with any girl that it might mean something too, there was always the thought that this might be it. This was going to be my girl and that was it. [0:14:26.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Whereas June was never thought. It started out on a very different basis.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, right. And not because of her but because of just plain old outlook on life. So why did this happen? Why did I suddenly be fantasizing about having intercourse with myself and why did I develop (inaudible at 0:14:52.4) characteristics? I don't know. I'm just trying to hash it out. And one of the reasons might be because it was so long since I really felt deeply towards anyone. And conceit I have decided is a very strong motivation or has been in my life. Conceit seems to drive the whole thing. I was never really concerned, except in the initial stages of any relationship, I was never really concerned too much about the other person as I was about myself. Well now that's not true. As long as the relationship was going well, I'm sure anyone, one infatuated or in love, is concerned about the other person as indeed I was. However, when it started to wane, there was no question in my mind that I was only concerned about myself all right. And now looking back on it those times seems so much longer than the other times when indeed they weren't. [0:16:01.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you mean at times when you were concerned with yourself seem so much shorter?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. You see now I'm looking back, and I'm really not liking what I'm seeing so you see all the bad parts. And I see that and really don't like it. It's disgusting. But the good parts I tend to forget and there were some good parts. I'm certain I haven't committed suicide all the way through college so there certainly must have been something that kept me...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But (inaudible at 0:16:29.9) the pain of long periods of time, and all you were concerned with was yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. And the whole sexual thing seems to boil down to an ego problem. The ego drives it, you know self satisfaction after the point of love had passed, then it was just me. And when there seemed to be no love in my life, then there was only me and maybe that's what caused this other thing to happen. [0:17:16.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That there was...</p>

<p>PATIENT: And then too there might have been something chemical. I don't know.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What is this part about there being only you in your life? I don't quite get that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: How should I word it? Why should I worry about wording it? If it comes out wrong I'll just straighten it out. Well anyhow when a relationship starts you're more concerned about interaction really. I was really more concerned about making someone happy and that it was really a joint thing. But then after a while you decide have I got mine tonight and you said no, so you go use the person rather than bring yourself to the person. And of course, it's all the difference in the world. And I see too much of the using in my past. Well you wonder about people that have been married like 40 years and certainly they go through stages. I mean I've seen my parents go through it. And I don't mean like just a week, I mean like a year where they'll be on the outs. Then they'll get back around they're loving each other again. Wow you consider things are kept going through all of that the good and the bad you kind of wonder. [0:18:55.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wonder what?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I guess I don't know if marriage is a good institution or not.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You wouldn't want that kind of thing.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, an awful lot of marriages all that keeps them going, I think, is inertia or children. Well anyhow we're worried about straightening myself out right now. We'll get back to that. So what does this all mean? Well it boils down to the fact that I really dislike having thought only of myself. I might be really exaggerating this but I mean a relationship might have grown and prospered for a year, maybe was on the outs for maybe a month or so, because I just have no ideas of the dates. I mean I could probably give you an idea that I have sketched but that's neither here nor there. The point is that I remember only the bad. [0:20:08.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They're the ones that's sticking in your mind.</p>

<p>PATIENT: And they're the ones that bother me when I want to go back and re-exam. There's no sense reexamining the things that are good in my life.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Why reexamine those, they're all right.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, let's try and make the bad more like the good or let's try and get rid of the bad. Let's take it back now. We've gone through the grand revision. Let's say that I came to the counseling center a long time ago, what would've happened in all those relationships?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: They would've told you what to have lived.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Or how would a straightened around me have lived them. Well let's see. Well ideally what would happen was I would realize what was happening at all stages of the game, and I would bear my inner soul to this person all the way. And then when it was finally to the point where I wasn't being I think there would've been no trauma because I would've been honest all the way. You see there's never any point, I don't think, in a person's feelings towards another person where you say I don't like you at all. I mean that doesn't happen. But people aren't honest enough to tell their day to day feelings so it isn't going to grow slowly I don't think. [0:21:51.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Feelings aren't going to grow slowly?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I guess they really are.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I just didn't understand what you meant.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Okay. I guess I don't understand what I mean either. I was pretty good at lying so that I could get by without divulging my true feelings.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You'd keep them back.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, until finally the point came where it was just ridiculous maintaining the lie. It was harder to maintain the lie than to enjoy the benefits of the lie and then came trauma. The honest had I done it the way now that I think is the best way, I would have been honest all the way. [0:22:31.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And so there never would have been any whys to create that trauma. The person wouldn't of had a false impression.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Now am I going to do that now in the future, that's a good question? It's hard to say. I don't know if anyone's prepared for complete honesty.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: That's a lot to ask.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Maybe a therapist is but that's about it. Yeah, it's going to be so hard to go out and say well I'm going to start interacting honestly everyone even in the first relationship with a girl I wouldn't be dishonest, that's really hard. You see there's another thing too. Let's take married people who were completely honest and then if they got to the point where they started to question some things and they said that, they told them, and the other person were just questioning some things too, that two negatives thoughts together and one might influence the other. So wow, I'm questioning, ooh, she's questioning too, I wonder and then it sort of snowballs. Whereas if each of them had suppressed it and sort of went well let's wait and see, maybe this will pass, and it did pass, then maybe this would've been a good thing to have not said anything. [0:23:54.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You're talking about what snowballs into what? Then they're having troubles with each other or just struggling with the relationship?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, both.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I see.</p>

<p>PATIENT: It's so hard to figure out because two people interacting, and one person being a part of a relationship, and the part of it to straighten out the tangle there. I don't know. It's hard to make generalizations too. I don't think I can. I'd have to look at each case separately. But I think the basic thing boils down to this and that's in looking at what has happened to me with girls and what has happened to me sexually. I think it pretty much boils down to self esteem has driven me. No, that's not right. But I see an awful lot of the cases where self esteem has driven me, and I don't like it. I'm sure that hasn't been... I mean there were times when I really loved a girl and was only out for her welfare completely oblivious to anything I felt at all. [0:24:56.7]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And those are the parts that you're happy with when you were in love.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But there could be a million of those. If there's one thing that bothers me I'd want to straighten it out. And there are many that bother me and I'm going to have to be very careful to not let self esteem be the motivating... Well I don't know. Well you tell me. What all can we conclude about this? I don't know. [0:25:31.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well I don't know either but first of all it sounds like trying not to let yourself get in that position of having told lies.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So that would help you avoid it. And then it also sounds like having some sort of not wanting to use other people something like that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's all clear.</p>

<p>PATIENT: The thing is if this is going to do me any good I've got to make generalizations. I mean if this is going to restructure my entire life and I live to be 110, then we just can't say all right this is how I'm going to behave with Mr. X, Mr. Y, and Mr. Z who right now are real people. I've got to say this is how I've got to behave in this kind of relationship. [0:26:29.1]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So it can (inaudible at 0:26:28.6) all the rest of you.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So therefore, it's not going to do any good for me to say well I've got to look at each case separately. I'm going to have to look at life separately and decide how I fit in. And I think that I must be very careful to realize that I will have self seeking desires. I mean they exist. Man is programmed that way.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: You can't deny those (inaudible at 0:26:53.3).</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, but I think that if I were honest any time that I entered a relationship, and of course the first stage is during the infatuation stage when you care only about that person's welfare, well when that starts to slip, and I'm worried only about myself, if I do care about that person's welfare, or if I ever did care about that person's welfare, I should explain to her that it is slipping. But maybe still it's going to go on forever, and maybe we're going to spend the rest of our lives together, but now I'm starting to think about myself too. [0:27:34.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you should tell her that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. The old standard clich� about give and take that you realize during the novelty stage, you giving is the most important thing and then it reaches a point, I think, you get some probably joy out of giving but you sort of get as much out of taking too. So that eventually you hope that it won't develop to the point where you're giving only because you want to be on the receiving end of everything, affection, love, sex, this day to day treatment. [0:28:14.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah, I guess you're saying you're hoping you can get to a point where you can give and take.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, comfortably.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: And want to be both of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. The human is not programmed to give exclusively. I mean for the longest time, I would say for just about a whole year, the first year I knew (inaudible at 0:28:34.6) if you remember which one she is. If you don't it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I've heard her name.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well okay. It's a hard one to forget isn't it?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I don't think I heard you mention her.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well she would probably be the closest thing to mature love I've had. Like it was nearly a year, it was 100 percent give, that all I cared about was her welfare. And then when it was in the bad stages it was about 100 percent take. And I think I've just got to realize that maybe there will be the stages where it's give, give, give, but then I should also be honest with the person and let her realize that when that stage has passed. And there's no reason why it can't be sustained past that stage. I mean look at how... [0:29:19.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What can't be sustained?</p>

<p>PATIENT: A relationship. I mean there's no reason at all why I can't do favors for her out of both a realization that she will feel the same way towards me and both a desire to please her. So that's what I've got to do. Now all I have to do is see if that's going to work well. If I could just have about four favorites between now and the first of July everything will be fine. Oh well. Another thing I wanted to do that I kind of avoided is self definition. You remember the little amusing thing, or you found it amusing when I realized that I didn't have a self, and I don't think that's necessarily a bad conclusion. Now I might agree with you chuckle, chuckle, that can't be, everyone's got a self. But I think it is pretty much the case that in my case it's very overpowering. [0:30:24.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I'd like to explain some things to you. I'd like to explain to you why I think I found that so funny that day.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, I don't feel bad about it but go ahead.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well okay. Well I had listened to this tape of somebody. It was an old tape that we had around here of a client who was talking about how he was nothing. He was telling me that and this therapist was saying that in such a way that it was like it was being no... Anyway it was just this funny thing. Somehow it struck when I was listening... It was a tape from years ago. It somehow struck me just like (inaudible at 0:30:57.6) and they could be doing a psychiatrist routine. It was so funny. Somehow when said that thing like I have no self even though you were saying it in a different way somehow it just struck me as the same kind of thing. But I have no self doctor. So I wanted to explain that to you okay. [0:31:18.7]</p>

<p>PATIENT: I could where some things would be very amusing that you would encounter.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah. But see now I understand what you really meant by that.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But anyhow I think it's probably very true that if anyone asked me well how do you feel about this thing at a certain stage of my life, like a year ago, I would've had an answer but I would've had different answer for someone else. So that in that respect I well very ill defined. So there was no real way to say this is me. Now I realize perhaps that all of that was a really strong part of me pleasing people. But there's got to be something in there. I mean I've got to fell some way about certain things. And now I've decided I'm going to play different roles, I'm going to play them honestly, and realize that I'm going to try not to lie when playing a role. But I'm only going to try to show what part of me fits that role rather than construct a part of me that doesn't fit that role. That seems to be where I'm at. Well now the point is I've got to know what part of me fits a given role. How do I feel about certain things? Where is my head? [0:32:34.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you can play them honestly.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. So now the point is self examination, and I don't know where to start. I really don't. I suppose what I should is you should give me another list and the first thing I had to do here was right 50 things about myself. I do like to go back at that and see how honest that was. Well I'd rather go back in July, but go back or not, but I should be able to come up with honest things about myself. [0:33:10.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But you're saying what you're now trying to do is think of a list of things that are characteristics...</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't mean one, two, three, four, five. I mean I want to sort of have a structure. And then of course I can go through the real simple little superficial things which I'm highly organizational, I seem to be achievement motivated, I like well defined goals either personally or someone else's goal. I very much dislike failure. When it happens to something I will try again and again. Those sort of things are kind of superficial but I think that maybe we can glean some important things from it. I think that I feel and I think one of the most important drives in me is that I'm egocentric, and I can never admit that. And I'm going to try to make it as distasteful to other people as possible. [0:34:14.8]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: To distance them?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Excuse me. You know what I mean. I meant the opposite. I don't know how to word it then to not make it as distasteful or whatever. Because I can see where that's a really distasteful trait. I mean that's why I hate myself I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Hate yourself for having that trait?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, because I see that causing me to do things that I don't like in myself. You know though actually though it's a circle here. I end up behaving a certain way and coming out of it hating myself. But the reason I hate myself is because I didn't come across good and therefore, it's really an ego that made me feel that way. You see? So I wouldn't feel bad if I didn't care about myself. But the reason I feel bad is because I care about myself. So the realization of that is important. Now I think it could very well be the case that ego is the motivating drive in the whole world that people are really only concerned with themselves. And then they come up with these people that belie that and I try to analyze in some way in which they could possibly be out for an ego satisfying goal. Why their lives are structured around that? And I just can't do it. There are just too many people that I know... [0:35:49.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But what would it do for you if you decide that the whole world was egocentric?</p>

<p>PATIENT: What would it do for me?</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Yeah.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know. I just would feel more comfortable about my being that way I think.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like if everybody's naturally that way, then it'd be all right for me to be that way. [0:36:17.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I just have this gnawing thing that people are... I mean I think that it's just because we're animals. We're concerned with self survival. And the martyrs that have existed throughout human existence either really believed that there was an afterlife and maybe they thought that they were doing it for that purpose or didn't think they were going to die anyhow.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So they were egocentric too?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. Or the person that does a super brave thing and ends up getting killed. I think he really thinks he's going to make it through and he's going to enjoy the adulation that people get for having done what he did. The soldier, the guy that runs out in front of a train to save a baby and gets killed, things like that. But I can't see anyone except in the case where love matters because you're mind can really get messed up then. You can do some crazy things. Well crazy now that I look back on some of the things that I did but really kind of sweet, the type of things you'd make a movie out of and have people tip toeing through the tulips. [0:37:41.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: So you're saying in that case, like there's a part of you which your ego doesn't (inaudible at 0:37:48.3) when you really love someone?</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. But I think without too much effort that I could very easily conclude that that's pretty much ego too. Let's see if I can do that now, now that I said I could. It's sort of a feeling of wow I'm in love and this is it. This is my time of being in love. And, of course, every time you are you think that's the one time. This is going to be it. I'm going to feel this way the rest of my life. Wow. So that you really feel that this is the time for you, and I think you're lack of control is something... Well it's just lack of control. I was going to say something you can't control. It's programmed into the human being. That's part of the ego part of the person to be that way so I don't think that there's any real motivation other than for himself. He's acting and behaving for himself. I mean man would not procreate if there weren't this feeling if it didn't exist I don't think. Well I don't know. I mean 1984, and I guess maybe he would. But I mean we could always have test tube babies but up till this point in civilizations, it seems to be the case. So I think that even love can be considered egocentric in many ways. When I say that, it sounds so bad. It really sounds rotten that a person can grow up living and believing that, but I don't think it should be so bad. I mean I can see a world where everyone realizes that his main desire is self preservation and for himself to feel good. It's not a bad world if people realize it. [0:40:27.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's all right as long as they realize it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Right. Now there are cases where family becomes more important, children, and wife. And there are times that I suppose a person would lay down his life for his child or his wife but really he's lost his identity of his family in that case you see. Or his children are his identity. I mean people dying for their children I don't think is too uncommon. In that case, that's himself, that's part of himself, and he really treats that as himself, so that's self esteem, self adulation. There's nothing new or different about that. I think it's pretty much in my mind anyhow it can be stated that that's what drives man is his own worry about himself. I suppose you don't feel that way at all do you or do you? I mean have you come up with a similar conclusion? [0:41:22.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Well the way I feel about it is that's true. I don't think of it exactly in those terms. I come at it from a different angle. I think that people are interested in their own happiness and their own survival. See the way you're saying it about the family like a person could give his life for his child. Well it's almost in a way a matter of words there because you can either call that egocentric because the child is becoming his identity or you can call that giving because he's doing something for something outside of himself. I think the two are very mixed up. [0:42:20.5]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, that's true.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I mean I think that people care about, the way I feel about it personally, I think people care about themselves and they care about other people both.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. I don't know if I'm trying to make it too simple and that's why I'm coming up with this conclusion. Well let me give you an example. I'm trying to come up with what motivates and then rationalizing it and saying it motivates everyone else. But I really think it's the case that I behave that way. There are a few times where maybe I don't feel that way, but then I wonder if I'm really overreacting. Let me give you an example. Well there are several. I don't want to make it like there are only one or two examples in my life. Any time that I've done anything that would imply doing it for someone else, I pretty much had some recognition there. I mean people realize it. He did this for someone else. Most often that is the case in a one to one relationship. Lately, however, since I've been alone, there have been cases over the last couple years, let's say, since Beloit, since the great metamorphosis, since college. There have been times when I really think I've done something... Well I don't know if I... I've done something seemingly for other people that doesn't get recognition. But I can always sort of let this fall back and say well people are eventually going to see it, and I think I sort of have this feeling that eventually someone's going to know. [0:44:45.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay see the way I think about it is two things aren't exclusive like you might be doing something because you hope to get some kind of recognition for it, but you might also be doing the same thing because you really want to do it for the person. But I think what's happened to you is you're conferring to that is you feel that way like you're doing things for yourself but you somehow feel guilty about that, or worried about, or something. [0:45:27.8]</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, it gnaws at me. It seemed so cut and dry but now it doesn't. There are little things that I do on the day to day things that I do, the trivial ones, or the roommate relationships when I'm behaving a certain way and I seem to be so and getting no recognition out of it and there seems to be no desire to get any recognition. And it's almost like a combatant thing that I'm just sort of showing... I don't know. Showing that I can do these things for other people to myself really, and I realize they aren't going to recognize them as being done. [0:46:27.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like for self recognition.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. There are other examples though... It doesn't make sense. I do have compassion. I mean there have been (inaudible at 0:46:42.4) things that have happened to me. I just get some strong desire to... Well the best examples are I mean the advertising on (inaudible at 0:46:58.6) really hit me any time I would see it on television or read them in a newspaper the horrible things that was happening, I'd send off a check continually. No recognition at all for it. And thinking back now, that doesn't really fit in. Maybe I really thought though that I sent off a check so I've got this stub that's in my files there and everyone can see all the money I've eventually given to (inaudible at 0:47:26.1) relief. But I don't know. I really was hit by it. [0:47:33.6]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: There was some real compassion.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, I think one of the things that I mentioned is that I cry very easily and I was continually crying over that, continually. Which when I lived in the dormitory whenever an ad for (inaudible at 0:47:48.6) would come on I'd have to either walk out of the room, or hide, or something because I would actually literally cry. But I wonder if the reason I did that was because eventually I thought well it's going to get back and people are going to realize that I've been so great about it. [0:48:03.5]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's like wondering if everything you did you did it really in some way to get some kind of recognition.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. That's way past and I don't think there was any recognition that ever occurred.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: But that's the annoying thing like I do everything for that purpose.</p>

<p>PATIENT: You're statement that it's a matter of definition of what is self? If a person gives up his life for his family, I say he's giving it up for himself because his family has become himself and you're saying he's giving up for others.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: I say it's a combination.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well there certainly must be somebody that gave his life up for a cause somewhere someone must have existed that did that. Is that person then just a supreme example of his self being transferred or a very, very strong part of himself becoming that cause and that that's really all that mattered to him? I have never I don't think except a girl, ever had a cause. Never felt that this is worth my life. Well not worth my life but this is my life so much that it is more important than the physical continuation of my blood flowing and heart beating. But I guess maybe other people could finally get to that point and do something for... I mean this is sort of making my theory fit into yours really I think. It's sort of my taking that other part of the self and making well that is his self. His family is his self. His cause is his self. So, therefore, that makes what I say all right. [0:50:03.5]</p>

<p>The point is though why should I worry about everyone else is like? Why shouldn't just say this is what I'm like now let's live with that so I am self centered; no question at all. Now I should make myself as livable as other people as possible if for no other reason so that they enjoy being with me and its self gratifying. That makes sense. There are people that I'd played certain roles with that would probably call me the least self centered person they know. The roommate that left for a year, Bob, wow the favors I've done for him and the nice things I've done for him, and I don't really know why except that I think there's got to be something eventually coming back, favors from him. I think that's what motivates me. But I've done an awful lot for him, and I think way down deep inside I realize it's for myself. [0:51:14.9]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: The way you're doing now is saying I am self centered and trying to accept that about yourself.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Struggling with whether to accept it or not.</p>

<p>PATIENT: I don't know whether I want to accept it or want to change it. I think I just have to accept it because I think it's so much a part of me. It's been a part of me for 24 years of life. Twenty-five, I just had a birthday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Happy birthday.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well thank you very much. I really kept it hidden. This is the first birthday I've ever had that I didn't want people to know about. It's sort of a standard rule if you're 26 and physics and haven't made your mark, you're not going to. If you look at all the great physicists there and they made their first major contribution about then. Well there's no way I'm going to pass this test. But it was the first time I felt oh I'm old. I don't like that at all. And the funny thing is the neighbors that are around me when I hit that birthday I became old in their eyes. You can go one day to the next your relationship does not change at all. I'm still 342 days older than Owen and 17 days younger than someone else, but suddenly I'd gone past that stage. [0:52:29.4]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Past the mark.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah, 25 and wow. That's a bad age. It's really amazing though that suddenly I feel bad about it and any day is so arbitrary. I mean why do we happen to use the period of the Earth around the Sun? But, wow, it's really amazing.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really hit you all of a sudden.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Yeah. First one I felt bad about. Well anyhow getting back, I don't think it's possible for me to be the type of person, the Katie Weiner that I know, this woman pathologist the other night that seemed so non self centered. I am that way. I'm going to have to learn to live with that. All right, maybe it's not such a bad thing. Maybe 99.99 percent of people in the world are, but they don't realize it. [0:53:30.2]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It's not so bad as far as you realize it.</p>

<p>PATIENT: As long as you realize it and don't make it uncomfortable for anyone else. You see it would be a horrible world if everyone were only concerned about themselves. If everyone were like Laura, and I'm really getting to dislike her now, it's amazing. I talked to June again about it and maybe I'll get to her next time but wow, no desire to see her at all. What a turn about. What a turn about. Well anyhow, if everyone is that way and doesn't realize it, oh what a horrible place. All these vane people walking around self centered, me's, everyone like me. [0:54:04.3]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: It really turns you off to have a world of them.</p>

<p>PATIENT: But if everyone were self centered but behaved in such a way that they realized that everyone else and behaved in such a way that they realized it, they cannot out worldly be concerned only with their goals or society won't go. Unless people realize that, it isn't going to go. So I think they either have to realize that or aren't self centered that society has made it. Well my straightening it out this far. And I think I'll fit better into the plan of things with the realization that I am that way and that I've got to behave in such a way that I realize that other people exist and other people have motivations and desires that I've got to worry about sometimes. Now hopefully something is going to happen where I'll come along, and I'll be in love again or I'll be infatuated, or I'll have some cause, or there will be something that I will hold above myself. But now again, by my definition, well that becomes myself, so I'm just going to call it myself. At any rate, I think yeah, I don't think I can deny the fact that I'm very self centered, and I'm just going to have to make that as livable as possible. [0:55:26.0]</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: (inaudible at 0:55:27.1)</p>

<p>PATIENT: I saw that coming. I had to draw it all together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: What?</p>

<p>PATIENT: I saw it coming. I had to draw it all together.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: When do you want to come back now? You said about a week or...</p>

<p>PATIENT: Well I don't know. Let me just think off the top of my head. If we have six sessions afterwards that means we have four before. And then about four weeks before...</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Eleven. We still have eleven.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Oh, that's right. We have eleven left. Well I'd like to not have one during it so let's meet once next week.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: All right. Now Thursday or Monday; either one is okay with me.</p>

<p>PATIENT: Thursday.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay.</p>

<p>PATIENT: That'll give me a whole week to think about it.</p>

<p>COUNSELOR: Okay. And would you tell... [0:56:08.0]</p>
