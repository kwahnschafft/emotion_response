<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What's that?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hello.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Hello.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sorry I'm so often running late.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's okay. Maybe it's the end of the day on Friday. Everything pretty much kind of built up. So yesterday was really bad. Today has been a lot better. I don't know. I got up and started going and kept going and not really stopping to think, just kept going. (pause) Yeah, it's good. I applied to a temp agency. They do third staffing (inaudible) talk to people and looked at insurance since I'm (inaudible). I will definitely have to get independent insurance. [00:01:01]</p>

<p>I finally had the conversation with James in which we kind of (pause) our two opinions clicked. I don't know what was going on. I think it was that because...I think James just didn't understand what I was trying to tell him about getting independent insurance. I don't know why because it wasn't like I was speaking that clearly. I think it's because the way school insurance works is so ridiculous. (chuckle) The fact that they can get away for not covering me for these visits is so ridiculous to him that it never occurred that he hasn't been able to hear that now we can buy insurance that will cover all of these visits, even though I told him a number of times. We're finally having the conversation where both of us were in a mental state to deal with it. (chuckle) So that's happening. [00:02:11]</p>

<p>(pause) So I have another difference between going to bed last night and waking up this morning because all of yesterday I kept trying to work and I just couldn't do it. I couldn't think about it. I couldn't. It was like it's a real effort to watch TV sort of a day. I cut myself yesterday. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What happened?</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I don't know. It just seemed like the thing to do at the time. (pause) I couldn't cut myself. I didn't have anything that I could do to help. (pause) So I did. I thought I would be more ashamed of myself but not really. I'm sure I will later. (inaudible) myself. [00:03:29]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When was the conversation with James?</p>

<p>CLIENT: About insurance?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: This afternoon, at like two. I've gotten into a habit of when I'm having a good day I'll call him during the day just to be like, "Hey! I'm feeling like a normal person. Let's talk!" (chuckle) (pause) I don't know why things change so much and so fast. (pause) My friend Heather Kate is coming to visit this weekend with her one year old baby so that should be fun. [00:04:36]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is she staying with you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think it will be good. But it's also, I don't know, every time I go to visit somebody or somebody visits me I'm really excited about it when we arrange it and then I dread it the entire week beforehand and then it turns out to be really good. (chuckle) I'm kind of in the dreading phase. (chuckle) It's just people all the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, having to hold it together at least to some extent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: To some extent. Heather is somebody that I truly...any degree to which I have to hold it together come from me rather than from her. We were best friends in high school. We were really, really close. Kind of grew apart in college and afterward in part because she had a horrible eating disorder and was dealing with that and I wasn't there so we didn't talk and we just kind of (pause)...Yeah it was like we kind of grew up at slightly different rates and so we were never quite on the same page. I don't know if that makes sense. But she's probably the person that I know other than my mom who's been through this the most closely to what I have. So she gets it. [00:06:29]</p>

<p>(silence from [00:06:29] to 00:06:54)</p>

<p>Anyhow I'm not (ph) allowed to talk about what comes to mind? (chuckle) I don't want to feel bad again.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I had a thought yesterday. Would it be easier to talk if you used the couch?</p>

<p>CLIENT: The thought scares the shit out of me and I have no idea why. But you know, maybe that means it's something to try. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We certainly can. I (pause)...generally people's experience of it is two-fold. On one hand it's sort of the left hand curse of not having more immediate social responsiveness which can be both freeing which is a part of it that I can imagine being helpful and terrifying because it can feel (pause) much more isolated or much more vulnerable. So I'm not saying it (pause)...I really don't know. I don't have an impression with you which would be more important. But I guess your terror seems like... (chuckle) [00:08:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know why it's so scary! I feel being able to look at people when I talk to him very important. I'm not very good in some conversations. I feel like I can't communicate as well but I don't know. But I mean, we can try it.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It's up to you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (sigh) I don't know. (pause) I think it's too scary right now, today anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) I think it would be isolating if that makes sense. (pause) And vulnerable as you said but maybe that would be better, I don't know. [00:09:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But that isolation is what more immediately feels frightening?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm not sure what immediately feels frightening. I'm just panicking and trying to figure it out. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. (pause) Maybe (pause) that encapsulates some of what you're struggling with generally? On one hand sort of knowing the value of feeling socially connected and on the other hand feeling alone and I think at some level unconsciously inevitably alone with what you're really most upset about or the ways in which you're most upset and disturbed. [00:11:06]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well I don't think I would say that is an unconscious thing. (chuckle) But yeah...it was funny. My roommate is having these gastrointestinal problems, might have Crohn's Disease, doesn't know, has to do tests next week or in a couple of days and she, as it turned out, had a really bad day yesterday and felt really bad, wondered if she should go to the hospital, really didn't want to go to the hospital. And I didn't know any of this because I was in my bedroom crying. (chuckle)</p>

<p>So at 5:30 or 6:00 I came out and there she was on the couch and she was clearly being fragile and I was like, "Oh how's it going Trisha? What's going on?" And she said, "You know, I feel so alone and so scared and they don't know what's going on with me and it's so frustrating because nobody can...they don't know what's happening and they don't know how to fix it and there's nothing I can do." And I was just like, "Yep. That's exactly..." But it was this strange moment where I was like, "Yes, that is...I know exactly how you feel, like exactly how you feel." But I couldn't...and I said that. I said, "Yeah, I'm in exactly the same position. Things aren't getting better and nobody knows what's going on. Nobody knows how to fix it and all I can do is wait and just keep trying new things." [00:12:58]</p>

<p>(pause) But it was like there wasn't...it felt like a missed connection even though we were saying all of the right things, if that makes sense. (pause) Yeah, I don't know. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well I imagine you were and were not in the exact same situation. The thing that's different is that (pause) the things people don't know about what's going on with you (pause) limit the ways in which you can feel close to people and kind of connected to them. I know you feel very, very connected to a number of people, especially James, but other people as well. I'm not disagreeing with that. But I think there's a very important limitation to that and so what's not...what nobody knows about you puts you in that situation and I don't think it's the same with her. I mean, with her it may be scary in another way because they don't the extent of the physical danger she's in, but it doesn't prevent her from being emotionally as connected to other people in her life as she could. I mean I guess that seems like an important distinction to me. (inaudible) [00:15:05]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay, it hasn't occurred to me to make that distinction. The main distinction that it had occurred to make was "you don't know what's going on because they haven't done the tests yet. They haven't done the stuff that they can do to figure it out. I don't know what's going on and as far as I know we've done everything we can." (chuckle) I know there's other stuff to do that's like ECT and scary shit. (pause)</p>

<p>It's hard for me to think about feeling so isolated because the worse I feel the more isolated I feel and the more I want to be alone. And it's hard but it's also...I mean I feel like (pause) the cliché of like an animal going off by itself to die sort of thing. I'm just desperate to keep other people out. But then when I feel better I forget, (chuckle) and so it's like, "Oh yeah! It's easy to be close to people!" So I make plans for visits when I'm feeling fine. (chuckle) [00:16:41]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right, and then dread them.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) Yeah I guess I think you feel like you want to crawl off and die when you feel that way. You don't want to be close to people because...</p>

<p>(thunder)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Awesome! Sorry. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: You like thunderstorms?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. When I was a kid there was a gazebo that belonged to the church so it was next to our house and I would go and sit there in the thunderstorms. Sorry.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (pause) I think a lot of that is (pause) again I think you do this thing where you're worried about what the things you're feeling will do to the people around. I know it doesn't feel like that. I know it feels more like you're just feeling so awful about yourself you don't want to be near anybody else but I suspect what's going on there is that you worry about what how you feel would do to somebody else. [00:18:28]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I mean talking with James last night, I cannot say you are wrong. (chuckle) Yeah, I was feeling so bad so it was kind of silence punctuated by me saying I feel really bad and crying and I just kept wanting to apologize. I know this being...this is so hard for him to listen to.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah it seems very sort of fundamental and reflexive for you to pay attention to and worry about the other person in that way when you're feeling like that. [00:19:29]</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I would rather be the person who leaves than be the person who is left. I would rather not put people in the position of having to tell me, "I can't deal with this anymore." (pause)</p>

<p>And I guess it's also (pause) when I'm feeling that bad and somebody is there with me trying to understand and I feel just overwhelmed, [I'm more overwhelmed] (ph). Hail now?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Hail, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sorry. (chuckle) Yeah. (pause) It's easier to say I am alone because there's nobody around talking to me, not I am alone because nobody can hear me. [00:21:09]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I can imagine it's much more excruciating when you're with somebody who can't hear you. There's the (inaudible) possibility.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, and it's not very frequent that people can hear me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To what extent have you felt that way if you and I are talking on the phone...? (background noise)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Sixty percent of the time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible — background noise)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (inaudible) what is scary for me at that trying the couch is that one of those days that [this does] (ph) (inaudible) feel less alone and I feel like I would lose that.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. The fact that (inaudible).</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, (chuckle) maybe so.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That can be the idea. I'm fine with that. [00:22:25]</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think particularly this sort of stuff... (pause). I guess (pause) I imagine that there's this consistent tension for you that may be one of the things that (pause) contributes to it being hard at times to know what to talk about or what your associations are is that (thunder) you're afraid of the facts of what you say. I'm not sure if it's that you wear me out or I wouldn't want to hear or I'd be...whatever I'd be. [00:23:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Maybe it's just that I wouldn't get it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe. It almost feels like I don't (pause) I'm trying to find the name of [it that are] (ph) important enough to say out loud.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. It feels like some things that occur to you seem trivial, or relatively?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, or not...don't have anything to do with anything. (chuckle) (pause) Yeah, I don't know. Like I show up today and I'm in business mode. I'm sort of thinking about my minutiae (ph) and trying really hard not to think about anything but my minutiae (ph). (chuckle) So trying to make that switch (chuckle) is...yeah. It's hard for me to kind of find something to grab on to. [00:25:04]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well what sort of minutiae (ph)?</p>

<p>CLIENT: How much per hour I need to make in order to live here.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me put it another way, sorry. That doesn't sound minute first of all. (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) Business anyway.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm glad you resort to didactic explanations. (chuckle) When you read literature it's often the manifestly trivial details as much as the obviously big events or statements.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know this. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So it's not at that level.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (inaudible) pointing out.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure, no but it's important to distinguish that it's not at that level that you (pause) sort of edit out the minutiae or practical stuff or whatever. It just feels like you won't be as important. [00:26:31]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah and it (pause)...Yeah I don't know how to...it's like I don't know how to formulate what I'm thinking about and by the time formulate it, it has already gone away.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like you don't actually have the words for it?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I don't usually think in words. I mean, I do sometimes but not when I'm around you, you know, for fun apparently. (chuckle) But it's more like I'll be kind of wandering through and once every five minutes or so there will be a sentence in my head but I don't, as far as I can tell, I don't think...so like "1984" and George Elliott...not George Elliott.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: George Orwell.</p>

<p>CLIENT: George Orwell, sorry. (chuckle) But the whole thing about if you can remove the language for something you can remove human ability to talk about it or to think about it rather. If you can get rid of vocabulary you can get rid of the thought. I remember I read this as a senior in high school and I had this huge fight with my teacher and the entire rest of the class about this because I was like, "No, that's not how humans think. That's not how language works. If the language doesn't exist people will make more language." And I mean, you know, [that is a little nuance] (ph) and it's like, "Okay well, it works both ways," and so on and so forth. But I still (pause)...but I remember being a senior in high school trying to explain to my teacher, who was one of my favorite teachers, that I don't...and he was like, "No, but you think in words," and I was like, "No I don't." (pause) I don't know, maybe I'm just trying to be special because I suck at this. (laughter) [00:28:50]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think you suck at this. That's not what I'm saying.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I know. (chuckle) I am just frustrated.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: (pause) When I think in sentences it's usually things like, "I suck at this." (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see. And otherwise are you thinking in picture or just sort of, I think what it's called, like mentalese (sp)? Have you heard that term?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Oh, mentalese (sp)? I have not heard that term but that's probably what it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it's sort of like...I don't know. I think the idea is kind of like words but shorthanded, not really.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it's kind of like half words, one-third pictures...yeah it's like a stream. I don't know. Yeah. (pause) And most of the time...so when I think it's like I'm composing something or writing something and two-thirds of the time the first sentence that I think is not...it's hard for me to think without editing as I go. [00:30:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, it sounds like thinking is a bit like writing for you in that one could imagine that for somebody thinking is more spontaneous and (pause) potentially less edited whereas writing, because it's sort of involved, maybe it's generally a little more formal and you're using your fingers in some way or other probably that there's this extra layer so it's like a thing you can more conscientiously do. But for you I guess not so much. You feel that same degree of conscientiousness in forming what you say.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's what I want to say but now I think I'm just trying to come up with excuses. (chuckle) So I'm putting those both out as possibilities. (pause) In the mood monitoring thing in CBT which is not actually mood monitoring but trying to exercise control over your thoughts in order to exercise control over your feelings. I do that. I already do that. I think, "I suck at this," and then immediately it's, "That's not actually true. That's just the way you feel about it." So you don't say that out loud because then if you say it out loud it becomes true or you feel more like it's true, (pause) which doesn't help. [00:32:33]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. You can sort of see the impulse toward coping in thinking that way though clearly after a certain point it can be counterproductive I guess.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And I think it tends to be, probably one more thing to beat myself up about. (pause) Then all the things...then my fist impulse is always to think something that is not true.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Though of course it also is in that it's something very true about how you feel and how things are for you at that moment; probably truer than the edited version; certainly truer than the edited version. [00:33:45]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay. (chuckle) I am sorry. That's an idea that it might take some getting used to for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: What I mean is when you say, "I suck at this," that's how you feel at that moment and it doesn't matter what the reality is in some important way in my mind. In other ways yeah, of course the reality is important, but if you're feeling like you suck at it or feeling whatever — like a failure, or incompetent, angry at yourself — any number of other things that go along with that, that's true. [00:34:42]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause) I guess I just...I feel like I train myself so much to...the way that I think about my depression is that there is the real world and then there's the way that I perceive things and something in my perception is really off and (pause) so I have to shift it constantly. And so it's hard for me to not take that step, if that makes sense.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It does, sure!</p>

<p>CLIENT: I'm working on it. (chuckle)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, I understand. (pause) I imagine that contributes to feeling so neglected.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean? [00:36:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: If you're (pause)...I mean, like being very schematic about it. Imagine that you're like a four year old and her mother at the same time and you're always telling the kid, "Well you know, you've really got to think about it this way. Well actually no, the more appropriate way to say it is like this."</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) That is exactly how I think about myself. (laughter)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So the mother's teaching her kid how to get along in the world in a way, or maybe even getting along and getting ahead, but she's also really neglecting what's really going on with that child. (pause) Because that four year old is always saying, "I suck at this," or, "Everybody hates me," or, "I'm not worth it." And the mother's saying, "Well you know, don't talk like that." I mean what the fuck is that? [00:37:21]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah but I've never had anybody not tell me, "Just don't talk like that." This isn't a new concept for me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm sorry, this is a new concept.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah it is. Maybe it's not but it feels like it is.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As we're talking about it, that's important. (chuckle)</p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckle) Yeah. (pause) I can't...I say...I feel like I'm incompetent and worthless and don't earn the air that I breathe and all of these horrible things and yeah, what I hear back from people is, "That's not true. Don't talk like that. Don't say those things." What they say is, "You don't need to feel that way." But I do feel that way. (pause) So I guess maybe I just tell people I feel...I think that I'm a horrible person and all these things and just establish that as a given and then we can have a real conversation. (chuckle) [00:39:11]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, maybe sort of like bracket it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yes, because that's always there and it's always in the background but I couldn't function at all if I paid very much attention to it. (pause) I rely on it more than I should to kind of (pause) get me to get my homework done but I also can't pay very much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: It also keeps people out of a very important part of your life.</p>

<p>CLIENT: But I don't want to be there. (pause) I know it hurts James for me to say that I hate myself because he loves me so much and I know that it hurts him. I can tell.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:40:27] to 00:41:03)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Let me think about that for a minute.</p>

<p>(silence from [00:41:05] to 00:41:32)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay, I'm pretty sure that's not the only way you feel about it. That there is another part of you that really wants people you're close to to know and to be able to sort of be there with you with it and to understand and help you with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I mean, I want that, but if other people (pause)...if other people understood I'm afraid that if other people understand the way that I feel about myself then they'll feel that way too.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: About you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: About me. And it's like if they see me in the correct light or the light that I see myself in then they'll leave me because they should. [00:42:35]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I (pause)...that makes sense to me and I'm sure that's true. I also think it's the case that you have a hope that people won't think that. I guess the reason that I'm focusing on that part of it is because I think that's a part that's hurt all the time from the way that you, [as much as they] (ph), remain at a distance from how upset you are. Is that making sense?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I think so. (pause) Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean I guess I could, just to sort of explain what I mean, I could imagine this developmentally — who knows if it actually worked like this — but that at one age you learn you're not supposed to talk like that. At an earlier age you have a fear that if you think that about you other people are going to think that about you if they know, if they are in on the secret. At an earlier age you just want to know so that they're there with you and it's reassuring and you're not so much on your own and that's the part that I'm pointing to because I think that's the part that on hand you're trying to protect but is also always getting hurt. It's a little abstract. [00:44:36]</p>

<p>CLIENT: It's just...I can tell people that this is what I have, what I feel about myself, what I'm thinking about myself. I can and I do but it's not the same thing as them really understanding or me feeling as if they understand. So it's like I don't know why, I guess I just feel like I can't ever get that close. It's not possible because for them to understand then they'd have to think in the way that I think and then they would hate me. And nobody does hate me. (chuckle) They listen and even people like Heather Kate who have that same abiding self hatred, they understand but they still love me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So they must not really understand.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: We've got to stop.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you. Are we on for Monday?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Does that work for you?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, I forgot what time.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) (pause) 12:30</p>

<p>CLIENT: 12:30 okay. Thank you.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Have a good weekend.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Thank you, you too. [00:46:24]</p>
