<p>ELIMINATING ALLERGIES - TIM HALLBOM & SUZI SMITH</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>


<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>SPEAKER 1: It's a pleasure to introduce you to Tim Hallbom and Suzi Smith demonstrating and discussing how to work with allergies. This videotape was made midway through one of our practitioner certification trainings in Boulder, Colorado, January 1988. The follow up interviews were taped a little over two months later towards the end of the training. Although the three clients in these demonstrations had fourteen days of N.L.P. training, this simple method works equally well with people who have no N.L.P. experience whatsoever.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM:  Allergies tend to be a mistake on the part of the immune system. Your immune system overreacts to something that is neutral or inert, and behaves as though  that  substance is a virus or something similar.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:01:05.9) A dangerous substance, in other words, inside the body</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM:  Let me give you an example. Since I don't have hay fever,  I could go out where there are all kinds of pollen in the air and  take a deep breath where I snort in pollen and all kinds of things. Those little particles will be in my body and I'll have scavenger cells in my immune system that will come pick those things up and get rid of them.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: These scavenger cells are actually called macrophages.
 They'll take care of the substance; Get it out of the body.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Now with an allergy what happens is Ill go outside and breathe in pollen.  I have a cell called a marker cell, this specialized kind of white cell in your immune system whose job it is to identify dangerous things in your body. Their job is to mark things out as dangerous so the immune system can respond. They actually hold up little flags 
and at the same time release chemicals that call down the little killer cells. So the killer cells  come to where the substance is, ready to fight. Since there's nothing to fight except this inert thing  they actually inject your healthy cells with chemicals and explode healthy cells. That's why you have red eyes and a runny nose.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: If your killer cells happen to come, and  find a  bacteria there that's been marked out as dangerous, then they explode the bacteria and get it our of your system, which is the appropriate way for the immune system to respond. So what's happened when you have an allergy is that the body has marked out something as dangerous, that isn't actually dangerous at all. And so it will go ahead and attack and what it is attacking is your own body,  your own cells, rather than something inert and dangerous</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:02:55.4) One way of thinking about many allergies is it's an overreaction, a mistake on the part of your immune system. It's basically in N LP terms  an anchored response.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: A stimulus.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: A stimulus response. You know, a stimulus is out there, you respond. There have been a number of research studies on allergies that are interesting. A group of people had an allergy to certain kind of flowers, and the researchers would hold up a plastic replica or silk replica of the flower . When they told them it was real  they would begin to get the symptoms, even thou it wasn't the thing they were really allergic to. With rats they took some saccharine water and put a chemical in it that gives rats an allergic reaction. And so the rats would come over and drink the saccharine water with this chemical that gave them the allergic reaction and the rats became conditioned to saccharine. They had the same response. In other words they induced an allergic response to saccharine that way. Later they took out the chemical; the rats drank saccharine water and got the same symptoms even though the chemical that created the problem was no longer there.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:04:07.1) . And we have a number of experiences with people as we've been dealing with allergies where we could say "What's it like for you when you're in the presence of X" and they can get the symptoms right there on the spot without having the allergen present.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And so far we've worked on all kinds of allergies - allergies to animals, to cats to dogs etcetera. We've worked with metal allergies people who are allergic to jewelry, or watchbands, or earrings; We've worked with -</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Yeast</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Yeast, all kinds of food allergies, wheat; We have worked with Poison Oak. And most of these have taken and they've worked over time, in terms of eliminating the symptoms. So we're real excited about the possibilities.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:04:59.3) And it takes such a short period of time to do the process that even if it were to reoccur it would only take you another short period to do the process again and have the person be rid of it for another period of time. We're not sure what happens when it re occurs. I had a couple of people with cat allergies where that has happened over a three to six month period of time, and when we do the process again it goes away. It hasn't been another six month so I don't know about the re - testing of it, so that's to be  explored at a later date.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Every once in a while you have allergic type symptoms, something  appears to be an allergy,  but when you get into exploring,  it's obviously something deeper. Its part of a belief system. Its part of some old reference system that you need to deal with as well. For example if asthma goes along with the allergy sometimes we've found that you need to deal with the sets of beliefs that people have that create the asthma first, before you can really take care of the allergy.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:06:00.7) Or whatever kind of secondary gain they might be getting by having created that kind of illness at a very young age.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: So the very quick allergy methods that we're going to b demonstrating to you  were primarily developed by Robert Dilts. We learned about them in kind of an interesting way. I was talking to Robert on the phone and he said "I can work with most allergies quickly using a dissociative process with anchors." And I wrote down what he said. I discovered later that I  had missed some of the steps.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: We went out and used the process with a number of people and it worked just fine . Later,  Robert sent us some written literature and as I read it  I replied "hmm" (Laughs) "This isn't what we've been doing! What we've been doing works just fine and it's even quicker"</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: There's another at least four or five different methods for dealing with allergies, all are quite quick. What we would like to do is demonstrate how you'd go about changing allergies - changing the persons' response to whatever they're allergic to out in the world.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:07:04.4) And it's a process of re training the immune system.. We say to the immune system - not this, but this instead.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: So who has an allergy that they'd like to make a difference in now?</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay, let's see. 
 </p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: BOYD, do you want to come up first</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Now a couple of brief comments about allergies. First of all it's important to know what the person is allergic to. Because sometime people say "well you know I'm allergic but I don't know what I have an allergy to." First of all you don't know if it's an allergy and second of all it makes it difficult because you don't know what the anchored response is. You need to know what people are allergic to in order to make the process work easily.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay, so Boyd would you tell me a bit about what kind of allergy this is you're talking about?</p>

<p>BOYD: (0:08:01.0) The Doctor diagnosed Eczema.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Eczema. So that's  rash all over the skin?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yeah. All over.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: And when does it occur?</p>

<p>BOYD: When I eat certain things like wheat or dairy products, high stress.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: So you have two different kinds of food items that will create the Eczema. Wheat and Dairy.</p>

<p>BOYD: Right</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: And how long does it take the redness and the itching to begin after you've eaten it?</p>

<p>BOYD: It's a buildup..For example if I start this week eating lots of cereal, lots of wheat and milk, within a week I'll be covered in a rash.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: OK.</p>

<p>BOYD: Then it takes three weeks to get rid of it if I quit totally eating those things.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: So it doesn't happen immediately. Now what kind of wheat are we talking about?</p>

<p>BOYD: Cereals, breads, any kind of wheat products.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Is it whole wheat products?</p>

<p>BOYD: (0:09:00.4) All kinds of wheat.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Any kind of wheat. Okay. If you were to eat one piece of bread, whole wheat bread�
BOYD: Wouldn't bother me.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: So how much does it take?</p>

<p>BOYD: Probably three or four sandwiches a day. Eight slices of toast a day. Toast for breakfast, couple of sandwiches for lunch. Bread for dinner that evening.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: So it takes quite a lot of it to do it</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay. And it's the same for dairy products?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay so it's the same symptoms, the same buildup</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: But it's all dairy products, anything with milk?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes. Anything with dairy products, yes.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay.   Are you aware of any symptoms at all at the point when you are eating?</p>

<p>BOYD: No.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay. So that we can calibrate, we've already done our standard reframe.. In other words your immune system was present when we were talking about this, that it's a mistake that has occurred.</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Somehow it has coded wheat and dairy products as dangerous.</p>

<p>BOYD: (0:10:00.5)  Let me give you this information. If I eat a lot of milk and wheat products I begin to have thick mucus in my nose. So that's a symptom.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Early on.</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: So somehow your immune system has mistaken these as different and dangerous at that point in time.  So that we know basically what you look like when you're thinking about it, imagine that you have just spent a week eating and drinking dairy products. And you can begin to notice what it feels like inside your body to have that buildup. And how would you know that it was getting ready to happen  -that you were about to have this allergic response, about to breakout all over?</p>

<p>BOYD: I would start itching.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: huh.</p>

<p>BOYD: I would have a small break out on this finger.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Uh huh. </p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: So imagine that for me right now. Imagine that were happening.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:11:00.0) Okay good. So we're just calibrating  his physiology as he's thinking about that. That �s all his calibration is about. Now, let's do one at a time, because they are not similar types of products. What is like wheat, something that you can eat, that's like wheat, that your immune system responds appropriately to, and does not create the Eczema?</p>

<p>BOYD: Cornbread.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Cornbread? Okay so let's use cornbread as a representation of anything that you could eat that would be other than wheat.</p>

<p>BOYD: Okay.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH  When is the last time that you had corn bread?</p>

<p>BOYD: Two weeks ago.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Two weeks ago. Okay, so I want you to imagine you have a nice juicy slice of cornbread.</p>

<p>BOYD: Umm.</p>

<p>SUZIE SMITH: And you are eating and I want you to feel the texture in your mouth, Okay.</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Feel it sliding down your throat.</p>

<p>BOYD: Um hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Taste it, totally.</p>

<p>BOYD: Um hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:11:57.9) And as you are eating this corn bread, I want you to fully get into eating the piece of cornbread, feeling it throughout your whole body. As you are doing that  I want your immune system to pay special attention to the response that is has to cornbread, so that it's noticing your response -</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: -That's right - to the cornbread. Okay good. Now imagine that you've got a  plexiglass shield that extends the length of the room in front of you, and I want you to see Boyd over there, Okay? And I want you to see the Boyd over there that has an immune system that knows how to respond appropriately to anything that  he might eat. So you see Boyd over there, the Boyd that can have his immune system respond appropriately.</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: And you can tell by looking at him, that he has all those responses fully available to him.</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:12:53.4) Now as you're watching Boyd over there I want you to see him eating wheat. And eating a number of pieces of bread, bowls of cereal, and other things with wheat in them. And his immune system is noticing that even as he's eating wheat, it can respond with the same response that it would have to cornbread. So see Boyd over there with wheat;</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Eating wheat.</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: That's right. Okay. I'm waiting until I get the shift here. Okay good. And your immune system knows that even with wheat it can respond the same way. Okay now come back to Boyd here in the chair.</p>

<p>BOYD: Okay.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:13:42.7) Imagine you are eating  wheat,- a bowl of wheat cereal, grain cereal, and have your immune system pay special attention , even as you have the texture of wheat in your mouth  and going down into your stomach ,into your body. Right. Good .Now there will come a time in the near future when you will have the opportunity to test this out and eat wheat, some cereal, etcetera; and I want your immune system to pay special attention  as you think about eating that in the future. Notice what the response is going to be. Okay. Good. That's the whole process. Now we're going to do a bit of testing. Wait for just a few seconds for the residual effects, let the anchors  wear off, and settle in. Now ,you said that you used to get the Eczema all over your arms -</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Wherever. Well I want you to totally imagine what it would be like right now if you had just been eating wheat for a whole week.</p>

<p>(Giggles, Audience Laughter)</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:14:53.0) Is that the same response that we were getting before? At all? The same physiology? It's not the same response. Okay, so in essence what we said to the immune system is "Not this response, not the response you were having to wheat, but this response, the one you were having to cornbread." Now I would want you to test this carefully, in other words I don't want you to go out and eat a whole loaf of bread the first night.</p>

<p>BOYD: (Laughs)</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: However, you might want to let your body get used to what it's like.</p>

<p>BOYD: Ill have cereal when I go to bed tonight.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay. But it doesn't need to have named this inappropriate response.</p>

<p>BOYD: Okay</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay. So. What's it going to be like for you? When you eat wheat? Is that a different response than we were getting before? Will your nose know how to respond, will your skin know how to respond, and your immune system?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yeah.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay. Now, you might want to imagine, at this moment in time, what is like a dairy product that you can eat.</p>

<p>BOYD: Um hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: That you don't have the response when you eat. How long have you had the dairy allergy?</p>

<p>BOYD: (0:16:01.0) About the same time.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: About the same time. Have you ever been able to eat anything else like goat's milk, or?</p>

<p>BOYD: I never tried them.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: You never tried it? I there anything else that's like a dairy product?</p>

<p>BOYD: No.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: So you don't eat cheese, cottage cheese, ricotta, tofu?</p>

<p>BOYD: No.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay, Anything white that you can drink?</p>

<p>BOYD: Umm�
SUZI SMITH: How about coconut?</p>

<p>BOYD: That's okay.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay , have you ever had, what are those drinks that have�
AUDIENCE: Pina Colada</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Pina Coladas?</p>

<p>BOYD: No.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: No? You've never tried one of those? There are a number of drinks that have coconut milk in them.</p>

<p>BOYD: Yeah, coconut oil's fine,</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Coconut oil's fine?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yeah, the coconut water.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Coconut water? Okay. So let's use that as our example. We can go through the process very quickly. Your immune system already knows what to do. So imagine that you've got a nice glass of coconut milk</p>

<p>BOYD: (0:17:01.4) Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Feel the texture.</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm. I like it.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: You like it</p>

<p>BOYD: Yeah.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Do you.? Alright and see Boyd over there? Dissociated BOYD?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yeah.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: With an immune system that knows how to respond appropriately to coconut.</p>

<p>BOYD: Yeah.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Alright and very slowly bring in the substances that represent dairy products. As Boyd's immune system carefully pays attention to the fact that coconut milk and oil -</p>

<p>BOYD: Um hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Can be the same response that it might have to anything representing dairy products.</p>

<p>BOYD: Okay.</p>

<p>SUZIE SMITH: Okay? Now back in your own body. Which of the dairy products would you like to be able to eat the most?</p>

<p>BOYD: Cheese.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Cheese. Imagine you're eating cheese. Right now.</p>

<p>BOYD: Okay.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: And your immune system is responding as it would to the coconut.</p>

<p>BOYD: Um hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:18:00.1) And then you can think of the future, eating a piece of cheese, or drinking a glass of milk. Now what's it going to be like for you when you have dairy products?</p>

<p>BOYD: Good.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: If there's any other allergies, you can suggest hypnotically that person generalizes to any other products. And this is another one that you might want to start  testing slowly. In other words; not a gallon of ice cream, or a pound of cheese; but pieces of cheese at a time. 
 
SUZI SMITH: Okay, so, you might just check - does your body , your immune system know how to respond to dairy products and wheat now?</p>

<p>BOYD: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: And when it respond it will be more appropriate.</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay, good. Thanks.</p>

<p>BOYD: Thank you!</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: We'll expect to hear back in two weeks.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:19:00.9) So you have an allergy to cats.</p>

<p>LIDA: To the cat hair, and where cats have been.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And where they've been. So for example if the cat had been on a sofa, if you sat on the sofa you'd find that you had some of the symptoms?</p>

<p>LIDA: Yes.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And what kind of symptoms do you get when you've been around cats?</p>

<p>LIDA: The first thing that happens is my eyes start itching, and then within fifteen to thirty minutes, I haven't timed it my eyes turn beet red.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: So let's say that a cat had been sitting on this chair for a while. What would that be like for you now? Okay stop. Come back. (Audience laughs) Let it go. Look at the feeling. So I just want to get a little bit of it so I can test my work. Because  I calibrate on what it looks like, she began to have some of the symptoms, right? That begins to tell you something about the way allergies are formed. If you can think about it and get the same symptoms, it tells you a bit about the process and what you can do to change it.</p>

<p>LIDA: (0:20:06.7) The reason why I get upset is I have to take my contacts out.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Ah. Okay. Well you won't have to go that far here. So tell me what's like a cat that you could be around and you're fine. Can you be around dogs and that's okay?</p>

<p>LIDA: I think so.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay. Have you been around dogs, petted any dogs?</p>

<p>LIDA: I don't pet any animal, because I don't know what's going to happen.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay. Well let's use dogs to begin with.</p>

<p>LIDA: Okay.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Imagine that there is someone's little dog, like a poodle sitting in you lap and you're petting it, and you know they're kind if cute and you're petting it and stuff.</p>

<p>LIDA: Not a poodle, how �bout a little Dachshund.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay, a little short haired Dachshund. Maybe a puppy. What would that be like; you know you could feel that dog?</p>

<p>LIDA: He's smooth, you know, short hair.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: He feels a little different than a cat.</p>

<p>LIDA: I don't touch cats.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:21:00.2) . Okay. You're seeing a little different response with the dog. (Audience laughs) Because that's what I'm looking for - do I see the allergic response or do I see the something else? But her body has resources and knows how to deal with little Dachshunds a little differently. Unlike cats. So think about the Dachshund just for a moment. Okay, there you go. Now what Id like you to do is imagine that there is a plexiglas shield running from that wall, to that wall.</p>

<p>LIDA: Okay.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Its two inches thick, you're utterly safe on this side, or that. You can see yourself way down at the end of the room with these resources. You can see the LIDA that has these resources and the immune system just knowing how to deal with the little dog way down there. And as you see her way down there you can notice that she has these resources that I've anchored around her, and there's a cat around her, and she's fine. Her body is behaving in an entirely appropriatelway, over there. Just take your time. See LIDA with these resources over there. Now. LIDA, I'm going to add a little step to this that Robert Dilts often adds. What would you like it to be like in a situation with cats? I mean you can get invited to someone's house that has cats�
LIDA: (0:22:21.6) And they jump in my lap</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Yeah, or something. You don't have to go through all those unpleasant responses.</p>

<p>LIDA: It's hard to be polite when you're saying -�
TIM HALLBOM: Yeah.</p>

<p>LIDA: "Somebody move this cat!'</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Yeah. What would you like it to be like? If you were the you you wanted to be in the present so it wouldn't matter if the cat brushes you or touches you, or something-- what would you be like?</p>

<p>LIDA: If I had a stuffed animal cat I would probably want to reach out if it had short hair. It's the log hair that's�</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Right. So you know that if you reach out and touch a stuffed animal -something you could reach out to and it would feel soft and good -</p>

<p>LIDA: (0:22:57.9) Squishy.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: You could enjoy it. Yeah. Okay, Good. Squishy. So, what  Id like you do is look right down there, and take the resources of knowing how to deal effectively with the dog, and knowing that LIDA over there has those resources, on the other side of that plexiglas-- lets see her being the she she would like to be with the cat. That'd be fun. Why not? There you go. How's that look to you?</p>

<p>LIDA: Different.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Different. Not so bad.</p>

<p>LIDA: I'm actually touching it. Is that what you want me to do?</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Yeah. See her having the fun she'd like to be able to have with the cat.</p>

<p>LIDA: Um - okay.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Now just jump back in your body right here and imagine that there's a little kitty on your lap. A little long haired kitty. And you can have fun with it, and know that it's okay.</p>

<p>LIDA: (0:23:58.9) If it was little enough�
TIM HALLBOM: Your body knows just how to deal with it. Even as it gets bigger-y our body knows how to deal with it in a resourceful way. When is the next time you might be around a cat, possibly? Any idea?</p>

<p>LIDA: I don't know but Ill just pretend that if I go visit a friend she has a cat.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Do you know someone that has a cat? So imagine that you drop in on her and there's that cat.</p>

<p>LIDA: Um hmm.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Kind of reach down and stroke its chin, how would you be?</p>

<p>LIDA: Its chin? How about the top.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:24:36.3) The top's fine. See, what I'm concerned about is not whether she enjoys this particular animal, but it's whether or not she has an allergic response to it. Imagine the cats around you. You sit down and you've got a little cat hair on you. Okay, excellent. Now you can let that go and look around the room. Now, the cat crawled out from under that chair, little kitty, and jumped up here and I was holding it. You petted her. What would that be like for you?</p>

<p>LIDA: (0:25:12.3) Soft.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: See a different response. What's important is you want to calibrate. And I saw a shift right through here. Okay. Enjoy the cats.</p>

<p>(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: She'll be one of these cat ladies; you know (Audience Laughs) Go to her house� (Audience Laughs) Thank you.</p>

<p>LIDA: Thank you.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: The reason I call this the quick allergy method is, once people know the steps you can run though it quickly. The fastest we've changed an allergy has been about thirty seconds. You know wham - o, anchor, see yourself over there, jump back in your body and that's about all it takes. But we can do it a little differently, and again, this is another pattern that's called foreground background .This was developed by Robert Dilts. And what we'll do this time is change what Bill notices in his environment in relation to what creates an allergic response for him. We'll change what he's attending t.o. It'll sort of de - anchor the allergy process. So can you tell us BILL, what it is you have an allergy to?</p>

<p>BILL: (0:26:21.2) Its darkroom chemicals.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay. All of them?</p>

<p>BILL: Some, Xerox machines have them, other Xerox machines don't.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Like the toner that they put in?</p>

<p>BILL: Could be- but there's one of the chemicals ,when I get near it I get an immediate reaction.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Uh huh. So there's a particular smell, or?</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: You can recognize it immediately.</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Now, I want to find a resource. Give me a counter example. What's something that's close to this particular thing that smells sort of close or something like it and you don't have a reaction to it. In other words your body knows how to behave appropriately.</p>

<p>BILL: (0:26:58.8) Paint thinner would be close.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay. So like turpentine? So you can be around turpentine and thin your paints for your walls and you'd be fine?</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: So we'll use that. So. With this second pattern-- foreground background-- we're going to do it a little differently. And so you might want to watch carefully. Let's find out when you're with this toner or this particular chemical that created an allergic response. Is this when you're in a darkroom?</p>

<p>BILL: It's quite often when I visit a client. A lot of my clients deal with developing, and I'll go near a darkroom, and Ill have to excuse myself and explain to them that I need to go somewhere else or Ill get very sick.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: What are the symptoms like?</p>

<p>BILL: My mouth starts to swell up; the glands just start to get big very fast. And a little bit of sinus ..</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: So your mouth swells up. If you were around it now what would begin to happen by now?</p>

<p>BILL: (0:28:01.0) The upper part of my mouth would just start to swell up.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Imagine you get a little whiff of it right now.</p>

<p>BILL: All right.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: I want to calibrate first, right? See, my test now is going to be what he says.  Half the time people have made the change and don't know it until they test it in the real world. So I want to calibrate it a little bit. So a little of that chemical whiffs by, and...</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: There it is right there. Do you see the shifts that he begins to make? Skin color, a little muscle tension there. I'm not sure the camera will have enough resolution to fully pick that up. But there's a shift right there. All right, now. I'm going to ask you a peculiar question. It may not make sense; play the game along with me. When you are around that chemical, what has to be present that you're not aware of at all? In other words, are you aware of the soles of you feet?</p>

<p>BILL: (0:28:58.4) I'm not aware of that.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay. So you're not attending to that, even though it's there. Can you notice the way your feet feel? The soles of your feet? The way they feel?</p>

<p>BILL: Uh huh.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: No problem. Okay. Now. When you're around paint thinner, you still might notice  the soles of your feet, if you paid attention to them.</p>

<p>BILL: Uh huh.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And you could, right? Okay so what I'd like you to do right now is Id like you to think about how the soles of you feet feel right at this moment. I want you to feel your big toe on your right foot, your big toe on your left foot -</p>

<p>BILL: Uh huh.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And  the way your arch feels, your heel� And notice how both  feet feel fully. That's right, Just kind of let that go. Now what Id like you to do is think about paint thinner, imagine that there's some paint thinner that you're going to use.</p>

<p>BILL: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:30:02.1) Yep What I'm doing is anchoring the sensation of soles of his feet to what? Paint thinner, right? I'm associating those two things. What Id like you to do again is think about the paint thinner. Now think about that toner, or that chemical that used to create an allergy for you. What's that going to be like for you now?</p>

<p>BILL: I still have a fear reaction of putting myself in that position. Uh hmm. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Let's say you were. Lets say you accidentally did, and some of that chemical wafted by right now, what would that be like? Sorry. Can you try to get it back? (Audience laughs)</p>

<p>BILL: I don't really want to.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:30:58.4) No. Imagine you get a real good dose of it. I mean there's a bucket of it sitting up there. You know. Well, Okay. He's getting a little of it back, isn't he?</p>

<p>BILL: Well, it's not like "turn around and run."</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: It's a little different, right?</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And there's some conscious mind stuff going on like, "Uh oh, this could be dangerous." Right? And with good reason. The part of you that says "Get out of here" has been protecting you for a long time. This  foreground, background  pattern is just asking  his physiology, his un conscious mind to attune to something else in the environment. He doesn't need to have that same response. I'm still seeing a little bit of that old response and I'm going to clean it up and make sure it's all gone. So what I would like you do is imagine that you've got some Turpentine here.</p>

<p>BILL: Uh huh.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And you take a good whiff of it. It might not be pleasant, but you know what that's like. It's kind of all around you.</p>

<p>BILL: (0:31:59.0) Yeah.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Yeah. Okay, Now Id like you to imagine a plexiglas shied two inches thick. It runs from that wall to this wall. And you're safe here, and your body knows just how to deal with paint thinner and with Turpentine in an appropriate way. But you can look way down there through that plastic shield, that glass shield, and you can see Bill over there with these resources, the resources of fully knowing how to deal with Turpentine. His body knows how to deal with it in the fully appropriate way. And you can see him being exposed to photo - developing chemicals over there. And know that he's fine, over there. Okay. How's that look, over there?</p>

<p>BILL: There's still something wrong with it.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: What does he need?</p>

<p>BILL: I'm getting a little reaction from it. It's like "Yow!" (giggles)</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:32:59.3) So what would he need to be like over there so he'd be fine? How would you like him to behave?</p>

<p>BILL: Just immune to it, No problem.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay, so what would it take for him to be just immune to it?</p>

<p>BILL: Not to feel the reaction, not to feel it start to happen.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay, so what Id like you to is watch him over there being the person you'd like him to be.</p>

<p>BILL: Okay.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: See him without the toner or whatever it is, without the chemicals. Watch him behave just the way you'd like him to behave.</p>

<p>BILL: Okay.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Now kind of step into behaving that way. Just to get a feel for it.</p>

<p>BILL: Okay.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Being the you you want to be. Being the you you want to be, you can be around Turpentine and paint thinner and you're fine, right?</p>

<p>BILL: (0:34:02.1) Uh hmm.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Your immune system knows just what to do. I want you to look back over there and see Bill over there with both of these qualities, the ability to deal with Turpentine, paint thinner and things, and him being the person he wants to be. With his immune system operating in a fully competent way in relation to this inner chemical.</p>

<p>BILL: Uh huh.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: See him walk  to a place where there is this photo chemical, watching him behaving, in a fully appropriate way. Okay? Now just kind of jump back in your body right here. So now you are here now. Imagine that there' some of that chemical here. But you body has this. There you go.</p>

<p>BILL: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:34:52.8) Take your time. Now when's the next time you might do this? I mean you might walk into somebody's office, right? Is there a time you might do that in the future?</p>

<p>BILL: Probably in the next couple weeks.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Think of a specific time when you might do it. You're going to walk into that office, and how will that be for you? You want to test it very carefully. I don't know if you can see from there, but Bill's nostrils are flaring, he's smelling it. I wonder just how surprised you'll be when it isn't so bad anymore.</p>

<p>BILL: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: He doesn't quite look the same.</p>

<p>BILL: It does feel different.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Okay good.</p>

<p>BILL: I'll try it.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Do it carefully. I mean don't drink the chemicals. (Audience laughs)</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Okay Tim added a second anchor on that one. As well as the one with Lida. Which is how you want to feel.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: How do you want to feel? Because sometimes people will look at themselves and watch and say that isn't quite right that isn't just what I want.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:35:55.3) And when you do that you hold both anchors, your counter example anchor that you've established in the beginning, and how you want to feel. You hold those both simultaneously ,.as you're having the person work over there, through the process.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Now you might want to use this other anchor sometimes; If someone tends to fall into it and get really upset, you might want to anchor the dissociation before you get started. So you have a dissociation anchor. That's only to keep somebody fully dissociated.</p>

<p>SUZISMITH: We've never needed that.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: I've never used it but it is a possibility and it might be helpful with some people. Okay? Any questions about the process?</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Questions now.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Yes, BOYD?</p>

<p>BOYD: The person you see on the other side of the plexiglas is with the allergen, right?</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: To begin with you have them see themselves over there with the resources and the immune system totally operating appropriately. And I like to use the word appropriately. Because we don't want people without immune systems. We want an appropriate immune system, and then you bring in the allergen substance present with that person over there with all those resources fully available to them.</p>

<p>BOYD: (0:37:04.8) It's important to get the resources first?</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: First.</p>

<p>BOYD: With nothing present.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Right.</p>

<p>BOYD: Not the substitute, nothing.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Right. Other questions?</p>

<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: If the allergy is something like a bee sting, if they have a sever reaction, what could they possibly use that would be acceptable; because I can't see anything real similar to a bee sting that they would be happy observing.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: A mosquito bite is one.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Ant bites.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Ant bites is another one we've used. Getting a shot feels a little bit like that and it could be a lot of things. And it doesn't even have to be pleasant. It needs to be something that's okay.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: That they respond appropriately to, again. That's what we're going for.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:37:51.5) I don't like getting bit by an ant. That's unpleasant. But an ant bites me, and my body reacts appropriately and there's no reaction, then that's what I'm after. In other words, a time when my body knows how to deal with something that's fully appropriate, when my immune system is behaving as it should. One time, one lady came in and she had just bought some very expensive glasses but they had a nickel core near the temples.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: And she was allergic to the metal.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: She has these big welts on her face.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: And she called me in desperation because she's a friend of mine.  She said "What do I do, I just paid 200 dollars for these new glasses and they're creating this rash on me."</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And we went through this process with her and after we were all through - she looked very different to me.  The calibration was different afterwards and before she had turned red -</p>

<p>SUZIE SMITH: Uh huh.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Tensed up. And after we went through the process she was kind of like looking around with a much more relaxed, different skin tone. And I said, "Well what do you think it will be like for you now when you're around metal?' And she said," I guess I'm supposed to say that I'm going to be different." Then she calls Suzi the next day - </p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And she says it's totally changed.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: She said, "I wore my glasses at my son's wedding all day today and nothing happened. The itchiness is gone." Now incidentally she still had some itchiness after she did the process. The residual from wearing her glasses and  she was already itchy. So it took awhile for it to go away. Three minutes after we'd done it she wasn't saying, "Oh the itch is all totally gone" . Instead she was saying, "I'm still aware of some of the itchiness." By the next day it was all totally gone, and now she's gone to wearing earrings,  with any kind of metal in them.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:39:42.4) We were dong a training a couple of weeks ago and there was, a lady  who came up who had a horrible physiological response to celery, where'd she'd get violently ill. And she watched a couple of these  demonstrations, and after that she had eaten a bowl of chicken noodle soup at lunch. She looked down at the person who was sitting next to her who was eating the same kind of soup she had, and noticed it was full of celery.  She had eaten all the soup with celery in it  and she had no response --just from watching. So some people change sort of by metaphor, just by doing it a lot. The lady with the nickel allergy had welts, on her arms and on her face from it.</p>

<p>(AUDIENCE MEMBER) And did this technique help to get rid of them.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Seems to.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Let me give you an example I was telling you I worked with one cat allergy that re - occurred in a person  It was a fellow who happened to be over at my house playing with my cat ,and all of a sudden he started breaking out on his neck. There were a group of people standing around  and I said "That's fine; I'll just do it again." And I ran him through the process, and the minute I finished doing it the color started draining out of his neck. And everyone was saying , "Look at that, that's amazing!' So the symptoms went away  immediately with him.. I was surprised too since  I didn't know it would happen that fast, I really didn't.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:40:57.6) And we warn people to test it very carefully.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Very carefully.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM:  With Bill  I kind of joked about  testing it gently.  And I would test it gently. I'd still do it because it could still be something that could be life threatening.. I wouldn't have him go out and have him test it on his own without being careful.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Because it could be life threatening. I'd have him go to the doctor and  have the doctor do a scratch test to do it appropriately. So if you have a severe allergy you should put yourself in the hands of a medical expert that can deal with it appropriately.  We've had three or four where it didn't work. Out of fifty or so.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:41:50.3) Uh hmm.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM : If there is some reason why it isn't working I sure would'nt want someone to chance it that way. It would be a whole lot smarter if you have an allergy that's especially severe - you know, Bill with the chemicals - his throat had swollen up and he'd lost his ability to breathe. I'd have him go to the doctor and have the doctor do the appropriate test</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: A scratch test.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And find out about the change as opposed to go out and test it with my life. So that's a good question.</p>

<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: For the three or four that it didn't work on, when you did this did you get the appropriate responses; did it look like it had worked?</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Yes and these were people we didn't have any follow  up with. We were just offering to do the technique, and to do our own testing . That was all we were willing to do to keep the study clean. Okay. So we didn't have any follow up with these people to find out whether or not we would have gone back to do more. After wards we found out it didn't work. It looked okay, and in some of them, it worked for a while. One example was  with  an allergy  to grass. I think, then she noticed it started coming back again. And so that's where you'd want to question why it didn't work. Maybe  I didn't have the appropriate resource . We were only using the one counter-example anchor: we didn't use the "how would like to be" in the process.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: (0:43:06.7) In our experience if it doesn't work, find a different resource. Take the example of paint thinner. Bill's didn't work. I saw a shift, so we at least got most of it if not all if it. But  I would find another, Id ask "what's like that particular thing", and anchor that. Probably the most likely thing is you don't have the right resource ; it just isn't quite close enough. With some other people, it's tied  in with something else. There's some big secondary gain for it. For example, One technique I did with cigarette smoke didn't work right away. And in talking to the person She said. "You know, I hate asking people to put out their cigarettes" There was an assertiveness issue. So if she got allergic  reaction to the smoke, it wasn't her fault and they had  to put them out anyway, correct?</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:43:57.7) And it was a nice way to say please put out your cigarette without her having to be so harassing or assertive.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: What she really needed was the ability to say to people who were doing things that disturbed her, "Please stop doing that .It bothers me." So it was a real issue. And she kind of developed the allergy  back. And there was a good reason for the allergy.</p>

<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Have you tried it with children at all?</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Yes.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Um hmm.</p>

<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: And are they able to go through the steps well enough?</p>

<p>TIM Hallbom: Sure. I've tried it with an eight year old and a ten year old and it worked fine. They went through the steps. The only thing about kids is , that they're quicker. You know they'll access a little faster.</p>

<p>AUDIENCE MEMBER: Have you ever done it with a generalized allergic response like asthma where you don't know the source?</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Yes.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Much more difficult.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I'm almost to the point where I won't do that any longer. Because if I don't know what it is, it's like shooting in the dark.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH:  You can't find a good counter example to use.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Think of it like anchoring . Its like change personal history. You need to know what both of these things are. You need to know what  the problem memory issue is in order to change it. Otherwise it's like you change history on a problem memory but you don't recall what the problem memory was. So its just some kind of feeling and it's a little harder to do that.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: (0:45:07.9) You can start very carefully beginning to pattern yourself to figure out what it might be. Noticing when you respond and what you're doing.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: And normally when you do that you can say, "What's it like when you get the symptoms?" And I can anchor that, and do a transderivational search - do you all recall that? So take this feeling back to a time when you've had it before. You may discover a pattern as they go back through a series of experiences. So that would be another way to get it.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: To find out what it is that's causing it.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: But I'd really want to investigate and find out what it is. I just think it's a little cleaner and you're more apt to get it and have somebody that's satisfied. Again if there are sever medical reactions I think its only ethical to make sure the person has a decent doctor involved -</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Uh huh.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: That's part of the practice. You know with a life threatening kind of thing. Okay. Thank you all for staying.</p>

<p>SUZI SMITH: Experiment with the process.</p>

<p>TIM HALLBOM: Experiment with the process. Those of you that changed your allergies, test them gently.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: So BOYD, it's been a little over two months since your work with Suzi on allergies on wheat products and milk products,</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: And I'm curious whether you've had an opportunity to test them.</p>

<p>BOYD: Sure  I've drank milk, eaten wheat products, wheat cereal, wheat bread.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Uh hmm. Uh hmm.</p>

<p>BOYD: Gave it a severe test a couple of weeks ago when I drank a gallon of milk and a box of cereal, and ate a box of cereal in a three day period.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Uh huh.</p>

<p>BOYD: And went through it in real good shape.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. Great So it sounds like there was a definite change. Aree you convinced there was a difference in you response now-?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Than there was earlier?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Okay. And can you describe that in a little more detail?</p>

<p>BOYD: Yeah, before I had the allergy, and it took a long time to isolate what was causing it.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>BOYD: And it finally got  it isolated to the milk and or milk products.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>BOYD: (0:47:01.3) Cheese, of any sort taken in any quantity of more than just the occasional snack of the cheese cracker or something like that.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Uh huh.</p>

<p>BOYD: And after the allergy cure with Suzi, I went out and tentatively checked it out.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Uh huh, yes. Wise.</p>

<p>BOYD: And added more to it, and a couple of weeks when Steve was teaching class he asked me how it was going. So that night I went home and bought the gallon of milk and a box of cereal.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Gave it a more thorough test. Yeah.</p>

<p>BOYD: Really went for it.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Great And it sounds like in that more thorough test there was a difference in you response than what it was before.</p>

<p>BOYD: Yes.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Okay great. . You mentioned something earlier about having learned about some additional allergies as a result now that the wheat allergy and the milk allergy is gone and you know that that's taken care of. Now you had a reaction to something else too.</p>

<p>BOYD: (0:48:00.2)Uh yes. Last week I had bought carrots and this was the first time I had bought carrots in quite a while. And I candied them with brown cinnamon and sugar and had a reaction about five hours later.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. And was it the same kind of reaction that you had.</p>

<p>BOYD: It was the same kind.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Okay so it sounds like now you, clearing out those other allergies allowed you to zero in on some other allergens that you might want to do the same process with.</p>

<p>BOYD: Right</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: To really clear that fully up too.</p>

<p>BOYD: Right</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: All right, is that something that you're prepared to do on your own?</p>

<p>BOYD: Oh yeah, I'm excited about checking it out and doing it on my own, and having the freedom to eat whatever I want to eat.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER: Great.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: So LIDA, I would like to find out if you had an opportunity to test the allergy work.</p>

<p>LIDA: Yes. In fact, it was several tests, and if I could explain what happened. �</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: That'd be great.</p>

<p>LIDA: The first time I tested, a friend in the class brought in a blanket that her cat, her lovely cat had been sleeping on.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>LIDA: (0:49:01.2) With long hair, sleeps on all the time, and spends a lot of time on the blanket. And I was a little leery at first, but I sat on the blanket the whole day. And then they rubbed it on my cheeks, I had it on my hands, and normally I would look at my hands and I would go, "How many times have I washed my hands" because if I get them around my face my eyes would turn red.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh. That's what would have happened before?</p>

<p>LIDA: Yes, I didn't wash my hands the whole day, made sure I didn't do that, and nothing happened.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Sounds good.</p>

<p>LIDA: So I thought, "Well that sounds good but, I don't know."</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: You weren't quite convinced yet?</p>

<p>LIDA: Then I was at a friend's house, who has two cats, and nothing happened. And then I was there probably four hours, and I thought "well maybe it was different breed of cat"</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>LIDA: So I had to go, last night I had to go to someone's house that I knew. Every time I had been in that house within half an hour I was turning beet red, My nose would start itching, and I would leave before anything else would happen.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh, uh huh.</p>

<p>LIDA: It was too scary what would happen next.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: (0:49:59.2) Sounds wise. What happened when you went there last night?</p>

<p>RHONDA: First I had to call my friend and invite myself over, which was real interesting to explain. My friend said "Well I really don't want you to come - remember what happened last time you came, you had this reaction and I felt terrible" And I said "No, no I'm willing to take the chance if you'll invite me over."</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>LIDA: And to figure out a time. So I arrive and all three family members are there to watch. And I sit down and I'm uncomfortable at first because they're all there watching. Like they're all three sitting across from me on the couch just staring -</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Staring at you.</p>

<p>LIDA: Just waiting for this to happen and I'm like "oh no no no." We need to talk we need to do something else. So after about, oh, twenty five minutes they decided that we'll bring the cat in since nothing's happening. I said, "I don't know I haven't been around a cat." So they brought Sammy in and they sat him on my lap, and I'm looking at this cat, and normally I'm going "okay." So I'm petting the cat, and I'm going, "that was not so bad." So then I purposely touched my eyes.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>LIDA: (0:51:01.6) And I'm nervous even, thinking about it. But nothing happened! I sat there another half hour, maybe twenty five minutes, and nothing happened . Sammy got tired of sitting on my lap, but other than that�</P>

<P>INTERVIEWER 2: (Laughs) Uh huh.</p>

<p>LIDA:  I kept rubbing my nose and I kept staring at my eyes and nothing happened.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Great. That sounds good. Are you convinced now?</p>

<p>LIDA: That was the final test for me.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: The final test. Well, enjoy cats.</p>

<p>LIDA: Thank you.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: So I'd like to find out if you've had an opportunity to test your response. Now after the allergy work.</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah? The day after the allergy  process I did have a chance to completely immerse myself in this by going into a friend's darkroom.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>BILL: Actually for about fifteen minutes, sitting there breathing, or standing there breathing.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>BILL: And just experiencing what it was like.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Is that amount of time  longer than you would have before?</p>

<p>BILL: I never would have walked into his darkroom before.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: (0:51:59.4) Uh huh.</p>

<p>BILL: Put simply. Just being anywhere near  the smell of the chemicals was something that would make me turn around and leave almost immediately.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>BILL: If Id be there for more than a minute, something like that, and Id end up getting sick for two days afterwards. It was a thing where I get the immediate reaction, I get the swelling, then I get very,  very ill.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: So before after several minutes you would get both of those responses? The immediate one, and then the long term one of getting sick?</p>

<p>BILL: Uh huh.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: And what happened this time?</p>

<p>BILL: Well this time I did not get the immediate response. My mouth did not swell up. Which is the only reason I stayed in there.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.</p>

<p>BILL: Stated simply, it was something that I did not like the smell of the chemicals.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Which is understandable.</p>

<p>BILL: It is not a friendly smell at all.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh.	

<p>BILL: But there was still some fear. I had to leave a few days later to go on a seven week trip.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>BILL: And I did not want to get sick.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh hmm.</p>

<p>BILL: And could not get over that fear. Particularly afterwards.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: (0:53:03.3) Because you were really worried about whether you would get sick.</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: After that not wanting to interfere with your vacation?</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah. An hour or two afterwards I was thinking that was the stupidest thing I could have done.  Because if I do get sick its really going to bother me in terms of going on this trip.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Uh huh. So did you in fact get sick or not?</p>

<p>BILL: I did not get sick.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Okay.</p>

<p>BILL: I'm not convinced that I won't get sick in the future.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Got it.</p>

<p>BILL: It's still something there.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: So what would convince you now? Some more tests?</p>

<p>BILL: More testing.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Do you know how many?</p>

<p>BILL: I'm not real comfortable testing just because I don't want to get sick.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Yeah.</p>

<p>BILL: So it will probably just be happening in the near future that I'll be around these chemicals.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: And that will give you an opportunity for future testing.</p>

<p>BILL: Yeah.</p>

<p>INTERVIEWER 2: Great. When you've done it a certain number of times you'll have the certainty that it's done?</p>

<p>BILL: (0:53:55.9) I think so.</p>
