<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Mm-hm. (pause)</p>

<p>CLIENT: So yeah, doors. Um...</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So with the room and the line (pause) It was very frustrating. They have operations and other certified numbers. We're basically... "You're being crazy. There would never be a situation in which someone..." So their basic response was like, "Well, here after ten, only students can get in. So there wouldn't be any more surveying." And I said, "Well, you know, a student can come. Why not a student?" And you don't anymore. I also just said, "Well, can we post a security guard? The guard, that's number, so that if someone was in there they could call us?" And that was also dismissed. So (pause) the only thing that they'd consent to do was that they were rolling with more than you can, people's notes, use them to block the windows and the door in spots, block the door. And to ask security, and that umbers keep telling me not to? So that he could look into the room at anytime? But, uh (pause) yeah, it was really... I mean, it's like age-related, the whole being here, you're just being hysterical about lady things. But it was also super-pressuring about... but if they're a student, there can't be a problem? I admit it, I wanted to bring up—because I had a restraining order listed against me? But then I was like, I don't really want to. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Because that didn't go well when I was a student, so I don't imagine it would go any better as not a student. And I feel like we've kind of reinforced me being a crazy lady in their eyes. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: There's a story about that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because obviously, you know, I was a student. And if it was real, I wanted the attention, and all that. Um... (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Are there times that I've been imposing or intimidating, or...?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. No, it's really just (pause) just thinking of like, not being able to tell where you are? And not being able to like, I don't know, I just think, like, in my head I could probably better spend my time, like, listening for anything, like, are you there? What are you doing? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Do you know why you'd be afraid of how you would do?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (pause) I think... I mean, when I was with the chiropractor I wasn't really sure what I was worried about?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um... (pause) I mean, if he has this sort of real deep wild super perky big western voice, and this super friendly, you know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Kind of (inaudible). Whatever? Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I just like, I guess this is kind of hard to say, you just go on faith.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think, not because I couldn't imagine you go on faith, because (pause) I mean that it feels on faith, and yet there's no content to the fear. (pause) Like most of the content... I'm not saying don't be afraid, I'm saying it's interesting, like...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I guess it's like, I think it might also be, not that there's not content, but it's sort of like (pause) these vague, generic... like, what am I concerned about? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Oh, yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Like if someone's blocking my exit, or if I'm walking at night. And it's just sort of like, it's kind of like everything and nothing? So it's like, okay... I'm concerned about physical violence, I'm concerned about getting yelled at, I'm concerned about getting harassed, being followed... and kind of all these things are possibilities, but I'm not really worried about any one of them exactly, if that makes sense? [00:05:47]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I guess what it sounds like you're more specifically worried about is not being able to see it coming, or to be able to protect yourself. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I think not being able to see something coming. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible) </p>

<p>CLIENT: Like it's more about the visual. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this something you've always had, like when you were a kid?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Um... (pause) sort of? I don't think as a kid, but I guess more like (pause) once I was in college, and (pause) you know, sharing a room, sharing a room and, like, being in lots of places where I didn't know people, and just all sorts of things, let's say I did summer camp. One of the camps I did that was, it was nerd camp, it was, you know... and that was sort of the first place where I was away from home, and I was around people of more than one gender. Because I've done girl scout camp also. And I was concentrating on something. So, like if I was reading really intensely. I mean, I've always kind of had a thing about reading. I don't really, like I cannot pay attention and get lost in it. But it was kind of more at camp than in college, where (pause) it would startle me more? Like I would be startled, I would be scared, like what? Who? I was reading a book. (pause) Yeah, it's funny, because I remember being a kid and my brother played soccer games, I would be on the sidelines reading, and sometimes I would have my back to the game. I just didn't care, I was like, whatever. I think the only thing I was worried about was getting hit with a soccer ball, you know? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: But not enough to turn around. (chuckles)</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (chuckling) And also, like camp and college is sort of (pause) I mean it's sort of like, not knowing people... I mean, in girl scout camp, I knew everybody from the school system, or at least in my grade. And it's like now? And also in my school system... So (pause) starting in... there were separate elementary schools, there were a bunch of them, and then we merged together in middle schools, there were two of them, and now there's only one. And then we bunched together in high school. So I just knew, I had known some students I had lived since kindergarten. So I didn't really feel, I don't know. There's not a lot they could do to be intimidating? I guess in a certain way? In part, also, because I hit puberty early. So I was, for a while, physically stronger and bigger. And that kind of stuck with me even when I wasn't, which was not always a deal. Because, for instance, I was like, "What if I beat you up?" And then I was like, "Shit, I can't!" (chuckling) </p>

<p>But I just didn't feel worried about it. Being around people I didn't know, and I just felt more weird (pause) and also I think (pause) you know, when it was just the age. (pause) It almost kind of came, sort of like sexual interest and all this stuff. And also what I can't have when I was in college, like back rubs as sort of a non-consensual attempt to touch, or whatever? So that was something that I discovered and really didn't like. Sort of the way the creepy back rub would work is that, you'll be sitting around you and some creepy guy would come up behind you and just start putting his arms on your back, and his face in your shoulders, and be like, "Oh, you got a back rub." And then he'd grab you, and it was always from behind. (pause) And I really didn't like that. It was also really hard (pause) you know a lot of time the way it worked, it was really hard to say, "No, this person needs to stop touching me," unless you get busy and got up and moved. (pause) I remember in college one of the big groups I was in there was someone in particular where, like, that was the thing he did all the time. Especially to like, (pause) new members, younger women, just like (pause) if you weren't already aware of it... Like once I was aware that he was creepy back rub guy, I always sat where I could see him, I would never let him sit behind me. But at first I didn't know that, so... yeah. It was sort of also one of those awkward... you just keep seeing it happen over and over again, and it was really frustrating. Because (pause) you know, when confronted about it or talked about it, he'd say like, "What? I was just offering a back rub! Everyone wants back rubs!" You could say that, of course. Stop. And it was hard to address the "stop coming up behind women and grabbing them." (pause) [00:13:26]</p>

<p>I still think some of those things that are like overt fantasies are just like trying to do my best, to do my best for that. (pause) I back into the door, like at least sideways to it. Um... (pause) and it's something that when I've requested, like once or twice I've had to be like, asked management, like, "Can you move my desk? Can someone move my desk, so it can be like this?" The reaction is usually, "Oh, we don't want to pull this thing off. We don't want to move your screen so we could move everything off." Which is like, "No." Or they sell cubicle mirrors that you can put on your monitor to see if someone's coming behind you. Which they also find really creepy. I don't want a mirror. Like the idea that I would do this, just sit there watching the mirror all the time, which defeats the purpose of having one. But it's something that I've had a hard time... it seems, to me it seems pretty minor, like (pause) you want your desk how you want your desk. (pause) It's just very frustrating to get a request denied and try to explain it, because then again, it's like, "Well, you're just being like, crazy and paranoid, and no one's going to come up," and whatever. (pause) </p>

<p>It's also something where definitely more women understand what I'm talking about than guys, and I'm trying to say like middle management, but, um... (pause) I don't know, it's also, like, I think about how (pause) internal in groups and with a common, predominantly female membership. So a lot of things where it's kind of like, like a lot of people are like, don't come up from behind me, don't touch my shoulder, say something before you touch me.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And we're all, like, frightened, because somebody tried to cop them. And nobody wants to talk about it, they're all like, "Okay." And it's just like (pause) I don't know, people don't usually rape you unless they think you... you rationalize it, like "Yeah..." And you know, if I might say this, the guys are always out, but why? But why are you worried about that? And it's like, "Because I am." Um... and it's like, "But I'm your friend, and you shouldn't blah-blah-blah," and it's like, I still can't see who you are if you're behind me, and I don't care. I really would like you not to do that. Um... (pause) [00:17:07]</p>

<p>I guess it's sort of that assumption, I'm sure it comes out of the assumption that the other person that I guess they feel they have a right to (pause) I don't know, to think about me, or the right to encroach my space or touch, and that I have to come up with a good reason for them not to? As opposed to, "Don't touch me unless you have a reason to." Or whatever.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: When people come behind you without a reason they should not be coming around just to get an okay from you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I also am more likely to move my office in my building, that's been like, one of the things I've been thinking about. I think the room's going to be claustrophobic, I'm really worried about that. It has really crappy circulation and airflow. (pause) A whole bunch of other things. On the other side, the way the desk is facing I like, there's a wall to my back, so that's nice, sort of? (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is this the whole office? Is that...</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I went to him yesterday and told him why I want to move.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And (pause) he was being pissy about it. In parts I think Harry did something to piss him off, and how I was describing it, he was like, "Well, you just all want it to be this quiet space where no one's around you." And I was like, "No. I mean, yes, but mostly I'm losing like, physical ground."</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Like a lot of acreage?</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. He was back and forth over, he was insisting that it was the same amount of space, and I was like, "It can't be?" But oh well, whatever. And so that, I think, was like... I'm thinking about being shut in this tiny room without a lot of people, and how that's really going to suck. And be super stressing. And it's not really about, like, I need a quiet and closed space to work in, it's that (pause) I really—it's also very high up, so from where you're sitting you can see really high above them. So there's just no privacy, no boundary. It's just kind of like everyone is just constantly there. Yeah. </p>

<p>But I've definitely worked in small spaces. One of the things I've thought before about working in tight spaces is that the experience of going to college helps with that. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (chuckles) I know that's right.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, because you've already had the experience of being shoved in a small place with somebody you didn't choose, and learning how to ignore each other and pretend you're not listening in on personal conversations. Um... which I felt very strongly at one desk job, I think she was someone who like, I don't dislike you or like you, but you're definitely someone I like, whatever, don't talk to normally. But we both know how to do the, "I don't hear you talking right next to me" thing. Or how you say, "Oh, but now we do hear each other," and that. I had someone who didn't get any of that, and was older, and was just like, "Mmm. Yeah." (pause) [00:21:57]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Not so much fun not having control over your space and complaining. </p>

<p>CLIENT: No. (pause) I enjoy having control of my space. Um... (pause) It's also one of those rejections someone where it's like I was unclear if I was able to not consent to being moved?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I see.</p>

<p>CLIENT: And then yeah, it kind of got to be like, this is just happening, regardless of what I want, how I feel, or anything? Um... (pause) And I sort of (pause, sighs) It's hard, because I (pause) I had a close rationale for definitely wanting to move to the same office space. He's like, "You realize we're part of the same team, blah-blah-blah, and for communication to happen." And I'm like, I get all that. I really agree. Your office is horrible. Um (pause) And I also understand why he can't just move into our office space, but (pause, sighs) I mean also, in the end, he said, you know, obviously creating a team and teamwork is not just physical space. Which is true. But (pause) I'm not sure that he has any plan for physically doing anything, besides shouting at everyone in the room. (pause) </p>

<p>THERAPIST: We should stop for now.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Um, see you back on Monday.</p>
