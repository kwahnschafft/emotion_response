<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p>CLIENT: I was panicking, I was freaking out a little bit yesterday because I was talking about you on G-chat about some stuff and he was basically telling me that he feels like I don't want to see him or talk to him. And we had had a discussion on Monday about separating the brazen (ph) account and him giving me less money a month so that he could-so first of all because if there is over interest (ph) or something and somebody goes over their minutes, and I'm going to have to be can I have an extra 20 bucks. And I know some of the credit debt is his, but I was like maybe it is better-he has all of this stuff he is planning for and wants to save for, he has a new plan now. [00:01:02]</p>

<p>His career, which is now personal trainer and yoga instructor and he still, wants to continue going to school and then maybe get his degree in something related.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: I can't keep up.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: How much of the credit card debt is his?</p>

<p>CLIENT: I don't know.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Is it like 100 bucks or 1,000?</p>

<p>CLIENT: No, no like significant but I don't know what has been paid off because I created new debt to and so I don't know what has been paid off.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Sure.</p>

<p>CLIENT: So whatever fine. Maybe I was being a little bit self righteous and wanting to just-it's better if we are independent on our own stuff and whatever. And also because part of it, he is complaining that he is not able to save as much or whatever and I don't want him to feel resentful so I would rather just let him do his thing and with the phone bill, I don't want to have to deal with overages, I don't know whatever. [00:01:58] </p>

<p>And also so then he can be responsible for another bill for himself, which he hasn't been for the last-our whole relationship really. So he agrees to it and I was if you don't want to it's fine, I just thought that maybe it would better, honestly you should be fucking thanking me. This is an extra $250 a month that goes right into his savings that he is not giving me because he was giving me $250 a month for the credit card. Then he is basically saying that he feels like I am separating everything to the point that he feels like he is thinking of me less and less and feeling okay with not being around me or with me or whatever. I was like, I don't know really know what I am supposed to say to that. He was well you asked me to be honest about why I was feeling sad. I was like okay. </p>

<p>So then, I started talking to Amanda and my friend Jillian via text about it that I was upset or whatever. [00:03:00]</p>

<p>They were honestly he is getting impatient obviously. He is getting impatient with this whole process and how long it is taking you to decide and so I think you need to make a decision. I was but I'm not ready. And then finally Amanda was obviously from everything you tell me, you're not ready to let go of this relationship so I really think you should give it another try. And I was I don't really know what giving it another try is besides adding couples therapy to the mix, which we haven't done yet. We are seeing each other. I talk to him every day. I have tried to keep a little bit of space but we are still seeing each other. Whatever. We land on that and that's that. </p>

<p>Then today-so I was feeling upset about that though mainly because I'm just always feeling as confused as always and indecisive but then I just kind of feel like this real pressure of you have to make a decision. Either you're going to tell him everything is okay and you guys are going to work it out and be together or its done. [00:03:56]</p>

<p>I cannot. I'm not ready to do that yet. Then today we are talking and he is going on and off of being murderish and kind of manipulative in terms of how he is presenting himself that day. He then changes (ph) the phone and he is I'm sad, I'm so sad and blah. First of all, I resented him for saying that he feels like I don't want to talk to him or see him because, I'm pretty sure that I talk to him every single day. I text him and say good morning or whatever. I talk to him online if he wants to talk online. Couples don't talk on g-chat all day and today he wanted to chat and then I was MIA for maybe 20 minutes or something and he was raises a g-chat that says, you don't want to chat sad face. I was give me five minutes. People don't talk everyday while they are at work. They don't chat all freaking day long. What is the deal you know. So, I sent him something like maybe I can stop by and say hi to you tomorrow night after I have drinks with Becka. [00:04:59]</p>

<p>Talking about tomorrow night, Thursday. And he is well I don't know because I will be up until maybe 11 so it will be to late. I was cool, you're going out. And he is yeah I think I might. I was nice, where are you going. I'm just-I'm not trying to pry. I'm just being supportive. And he is with a friend to celebrate her birthday. I was-this is exactly what I talked to him about. Don't be but be translucent. Don't say my friend, just say I'm going out for this girl that I know, whatever. Say a name at first so that I'm not-obviously I'm going to be which friend. Anyways it turns out that it is some girl, he dances around the question for a good back and forth. He starts saying, well I don't know if I want to go because.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: She (ph) had a slip there.</p>

<p>CLIENT: What? </p>

<p>THERAPIST: You said be translucent, you meant be transparent.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. [00:06:00]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Translucent is what you don't want him to be and what he is being. </p>

<p>CLIENT: (chuckles) (crosstalk) Yeah transparent is what I meant.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's funny. He's not being and he starts going on about how this girl-he is not sure if he wants to go because he doesn't think it's a gathering and he thinks its just her and he thinks she might have other intentions and so he is not really sure. I'm like okay. And then finally when he gets down to what is her name, he is "it's Shauna. Stalker..." I was why and he is "I'm sure you're going to go to my Facebook page and look her up now." I was that so unwarranted but okay. And then I'm telling Amanda this and she is "I don't understand why is he telling you this right now. Why is he telling you about-I don't understand. He wants you to trust him. Maybe is he telling you this so look I'm catching it before it becomes something." [00:06:59]</p>

<p>I don't get it. And then it's if I hadn't brought up do we want to go out, would you not have just told me about this plan at all. You're going to meet some girl for drinks that you randomly re-friended that you knew from high school but then we talk about randomly friending girls and that it made me uncomfortable and that you should not do it right now. I just don't get it you know. What is his thinking? I don't understand what his thinking is and then he is all martyr, all I'm so sorry well with me but then still acting like an ass when it comes down to me asking about things that have to do with level of trust. And so it kind of after I thought about it, I'm going to call a couple of therapists and try to make this work because I don't want to, I'm not ready to lose him or whatever. It kind of just deleted it today by him acting like an ass again. It just leaves me not really knowing what to do once again and just not even, I'm just panicking and feeling the pressure from him and feeling the pressure from other people being like why are you dragging this out. [00:08:07]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you are pretty translucent because if he was transparent then you would know that you really couldn't accept it. I mean if he said well, I'm going out with this woman to celebrate her birthday tomorrow night and I think she is interested and I'm going to be back late so I can't hang out with you.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right (chuckles)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That is actually what was going on.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And if he came out and just said it like that, and I know you're going to be sort of anxious and jealous when I say this, but here it is or and here it is. That would be transparent. I don't think (inaudible at 8:47)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Well, why why?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 8:53)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Why do you think I want to hear that? I would rather not hear any of it at all. I would rather it not be going on. [00:09:04]</p>

<p>Why are you going to accept to go out with drinks with this girl?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, of course you don't want to hear this, except that's kind of the point. Anyone that says—hey it's better if he is vague and evasive. Yeah. That's been the history, I think.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That's how he has always been yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Between you is that he has been vague and evasive and you have been kind of angry and jealous and you haven't really wanted to know or you wanted to deny it or you wanted to minimize it and then eventually something so flagrant happened and you kind of can't anymore.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And then you get upset and pull away from him. [00:09:58]</p>

<p>And you don't want to leave him and it kind of quiets down and nothing really much changes.</p>

<p>CLIENT: No. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: And it happens again. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. I just-yeah I want him to be honest with me but-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: But I think you don't want him to be doing what he is doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Exactly. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which is different than being honest about what he is doing.</p>

<p>CLIENT: True. True. I want him to be honest about things like, I am going out with my friend, about things that are appropriate. [00:10:53]</p>

<p>I guess I don't want him to fucking do the shit that we talked about him not doing that clearly is still fucking going on, which is chatting with the girls on Facebook that you just, newly friended girls. Newly friended but I don't care if you knew her in high school. Please you didn't even graduate high school. You were in high school for like 2 1/2 years. Take it easy. This is not some long lost friend that you have now reconnected with. Then even going as far as accepting the offer, "hey you want to go out for a drink and catch up." Like accepting that offer and now be in a position of "I think, I don't know, maybe she is interested. I think I should cancel." Where is your brain right now? That is what I wished I said to him, but then he would have just gotten all defensive and blamed me. "Well, at least I'm telling you, geez you need to let me take care of my own stuff." And it goes hand in hand with the whole, okay his whole life goal has changed again and now this is what he wants to be doing but he is still not back at school. He is still not studying for this stuff. He is not telling me, I saved this much to put towards these certificates and I have studied this much. I mean that is still not going on. [00:11:58]</p>

<p>It goes hand in hand with all of this stuff that he tells me, but I changed so much the way that I think about everything and now my whole life is changed and I'm blah blah. It's clearly really not. And you know that basic question; okay how many other girls recently have you been chatting with online again? The same bullshit that we talked about before. Is this an anomaly? I don't know. Why are you telling me this? Why are you telling me a girl who you think might be interested-it's just baffles me, you know. </p>

<p>And then I try to be supportive and I try to do all these things that make him feel so that he doesn't feel bad but I still get told that he feels like I am not wanting to hang out with him and talk to him. And by not talking to him enough will make you chat during the day. I'm not there and he really needed me to be there, having a bad day. [00:12:59]</p>

<p>I will literally be in the middle of a conversation and maybe I will get pulled away for could be 20 minutes and he will be messaging me, hello, hello, hello, I guess you don't want to talk. Dude, you know I'm at work, assume that I clearly am doing something. I'm working. I do events. Maybe there is an event and I got pulled for two hours into an event and there should be no question in your mind. And to be perfectly frank, normal people don't talk like normal couples do not chat all day long the entire work day on g-chat a constant conversation. I just don't see people doing that and probably they like each other better because they don't. And he just doesn't get it. Then he brings up how Friday and Saturday night, I don't know, he said something about he doesn't really like wasting time on people that don't deserve his attention and there is not many of those out there so he would rather just either go out and do his own thing or go out when a bunch of people are going out so he doesn't have to hang out with any one individual. [00:14:09]</p>

<p>And I was something along the lines of; I don't even know what I said. I was you don't like going out to dinner and drinks sometimes just with a friend one on one. And he literally was the only person I really like doing that with is with you. I was wow isn't that fucking smothering me even more than I am already being smothered. That is not normal. What's wrong with the world that you can't go have dinner with a friend. It's so horrible that they talk about girls, okay so change the fucking subject it you don't want to talk about girls. I don't know what to tell you. Then he says that he is going to stop seeing his therapist as much because it is too much, too many times a week and the co-pay and he doesn't have time for all of the exercise that he is assigning him. [00:14:56] </p>

<p>I was, exercises? What kind of exercises? He is "okay miss investigator." I was you brought it up. Whatever. He is "social exercises." I was that seems like it could be helpful because you mentioned that you have issues with bahbahbah. And he is, "well yeah, but I just don't know how to fit it in." I'm like what are you so fucking busy with? Like you're studying hours a night. I can't see that really happening. I'm like you call me every-every time you call me, you're watching some fucking anime, you're that busy and you can't-social exercises, its probably call your friend and make a plan or whatever. I don't fucking know but I'm okay. It's just very frustrating to feel he is not really doing anything but that he thinks he is so that if I say that he is not, he gets really upset at me and says I'm not seeing things the way that they are or as they should be or whatever. [00:16:00]</p>

<p>And then bringing this stuff again, "I'm thinking about you less and less". That is mean. That is not nice that, "I'm just being honest." Fuck you being honest then. If you want to know, I'm fucking happy you're not there to fucking bother me about how I feed the cats. How does that feel? That is what I feel like saying. And it puts me in a position of feeling that maybe we should just break up since I'm still feeling torn about and feeling like he is going to hate me and resent me, blame me, you know. It's just going to be very messy. It's almost as if between yesterday and my friends kind of being like make a decision. Obviously you don't want to do leave him yet so just try to make it work and then me being yeah I'm going to try and then today it just all blowing up in my face with telling me he doesn't want to hang out with anybody and being a martyr and being manipulative and telling me about this plan with this chick. It's just like okay. I guess we are at point A again. [00:17:00]</p>

<p>And me feeling like if I do want to break up with him, I don't really know how. I don't even really know how to begin to explain why I don't want to put more effort towards this. (pause) I don't feel like he really appreciates the things that I have done for him. It almost feels like he may feel or think or commits himself that either I wanted a lot of this stuff to happen so that is why I helped him with it or you know that it was going to get done anyway, I just helped it happen quicker or whatever, which is really not the case. You know I [gave him] (ph) the money and he is criticizing the way that I discipline the cats when they are doing something wrong or that I don't do it enough when I was I'm feeding them and taking care of them everyday. [00:18:04]</p>

<p>I know, I'm about to spend 400 dollars on the echocardiogram for my cat because he has a heart murmur and he has lost a lot of weight in the last few months and the doctor recommended that he get it and I'm not going to not do it. I could change his diet and then wait and see if he gains weight and whatever but because he has a heart murmur she says it could be related to heart disease and that is my cat, I love him. I'm going to go do it. I'm bringing him to the vet. I'm paying for the vet with whatever money that I have. I'm bringing him to the fucking cardiologist. And then he has the balls to criticize me about how I discipline them, fuck you. It is just getting to a point where I'm really not sure if I can see the worse (ph) anymore or the tunnel vision that I see us being together at the end of is getting smaller and smaller. I just didn't— [00:18:59]</p>

<p>(pause) I mean it's similar to kind of something that you hinted on and that my friend echoed last night in a conversation that I was having with her, which is that I want him to be a kind of man that maybe he can never be or probably can't ever be. I'm really starting to believe that now. And then aside from the things that maybe we could work on in couple's therapy, what about the things that we can't really work on in couple's therapy, like your family are fucking assholes. (pause) I can't be, by the way it would be really great if everybody in your family had a high school degree and weren't ghetto. Could you do something about that? (pause) Because you know, I'm thinking about the future, I think it is important to marry somebody who, yeah you're not marrying somebody for their family and I was a real firm believer in that, no matter what who cares about the family until I really-I guess I'm getting older and I started thinking about, shit my parents are kind of old. [00:20:02]</p>

<p>By the time I have kids, maybe four to five years from now, they're going to be four or five years older and I'm-most parents aren't as old as mine at my age just my parents had me older, its not the majority of the people my age so potentially I would be with a man whose family is a little bit younger and who potentially could help out when I needed help. Even though his family is that, they are younger. I would not trust them with my child alone ever no matter what and so that just eliminates that whole side of the equation. And that is a big deal, it's a big deal it really makes a difference. Where in one scenario I may not have to pay a babysitter when I need to run out last minute because whatever, in my case I probably would. Where one parent has to stay home. And then not to mention, not to mention, if I'm having to nag him all the time about get back into school, follow through with your plans, whatever. [00:20:58]</p>

<p>Am I going to be the only one making sure that our children follow through with their plans and do what they are supposed to? He is so yeah yeah I'm going to do it but so flaky about it that I can't believe that he would be any different with our children. And when we are talking about, we'll do it later, we'll get this anime, whatever. No. Do what you are supposed to do. It's exhausting, it's exhausting. So I guess I'm at the point where I'm just about feeling okay, I am ready to just make a decision in one direction.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (crosstalk) about all this stuff you already know.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Because you're really scared of the thought of breaking up with him.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. And then I feel even worse because then I think about that and sometimes its almost as if I am more scared of the process of doing it than I am of being without him or more scared more like nervous about the process rather than the idea of not being with him anymore. [00:22:00]</p>

<p>Then I feel bad and I feel guilty and I feel sad.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Possibly, I'm missing something but (inaudible at 22:18) more, the process of breaking up with somebody is pretty simple especially after you're already not living together and so much is separated anyway and I guess it sounds more to me like you're just avoiding that because thinking about it is so painful. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I mean [you tell somebody say you] (ph) have a conversation with him and tell him what you want. [I mean] (ph) surprise is to why at this point.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: [You can] (ph) tell him that. [00:23:01]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, so I guess it is maybe the prospect of the whole situation (ph). I mean you know, he still has some stuff at my house, so I guess that can't be fully it. [Got to get his stuff] (ph)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I suspect you figured things out that are way more complicated than [how the time] (ph). I think it just, think about it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: It is. It's hard to think about, I do have some fears of well despite all his whatever issues or the issues that I have with him, he is a good boyfriend, he does take care of me when I need to want to be taken care of. Saturday night I went out with Jillian and somehow we both got blackout drunk, we don't even remember. I drank a little bit more than she did because her son's father was the one that got us into this club or whatever. [00:24:01]</p>

<p>He kept-twice he brought us shots like mixed shots and she was pouring hers out because she didn't want whatever, she doesn't want him to think like you drink-but then I drank mine fine but both of us, blackout drunk that we didn't even realize how drunk we were until we get to her car and she sits down, she goes oh my god, I can't drive. I can't. Luckily, Franklin was at a thing at a place nearby so, I happened to know this because we had stopped by to see him before. So he drove us home, stayed over at my house. The next morning I woke up literally like oh my god, what the fuck. And he got me Dunkin' Donuts, rolled a little joint because that helps with my hangover, bought me PowerAde. Was really sweet and took care of me. So then, I think about that and I'm like what if nobody else would do that kind of stuff for me. Which I think is little bit silly. [00:24:56]</p>

<p>But I think it's maybe my subconscious kind of being or maybe my guilty I don't know whatever I am feeling guilty about the whole situation being look what he does for you, he's all nice. It's just, it's just exhausting. I constantly feel like I am having to look after his feelings and look after his state of mind and well being and listen to him talk about how he doesn't like hanging out with anybody and then I feel guilty because I had so much fun with my friend. (pause) I guess nervous scared or whatever because I am getting to the point where I'm just starting to feel like this is just not going to go in the direction that I would really like to see it go and maybe it never was going to go that way and him not recognizing that some of the things he is doing are still characteristic of the things that I asked him not to do, that bother me, and that I want him to improve upon. [00:26:02]</p>

<p>He is saying how much he changed and everything but if you're still doing things even if not to the same extent that I told you specifically that I don't want you to do, then how can I believe that you have changed so drastically. I had a conversation with him about not friending and not chatting with random people that he doesn't know or hasn't talked to or whatever and he is doing it still. I asked him to unfriend this woman who was a mutual friend with the girl Betty and who in my stalking of Betty's page, which I haven't done in a couple of days. Yay. (chuckles) Like showed up in some family pictures and like commented oh love you Betty on something. So like listen, this may sound petty but I would feel really a lot more comfortable if you just unfriended her so that there wasn't an association or whatever. He then refriended her. [00:27:01]</p>

<p>I was, what's up? He is "Oh, she friend requested me again, and I was just, man who cares. It's a 40 year old woman, I'm not going to, it has nothing to do with anything." I was, well okay that may be the case but I asked you to not be friends with her on Facebook specifically because it just inherently made me uncomfortable. That was an issue. It was my issue. It was "Trina, you're really, that's really to much." Okay, how many things are now going to begin to be like "Your ridiculous Trina, I'm going to do what I want." And the friending of random people, stop you know. And he is, "Well, I'm changing out of Facebook anyway, so it doesn't matter." I was all right. Whatever that means. People are still reaching out to you on Facebook. I don't know. It's just such bullshit. [00:27:55]</p>

<p>It is. It's bullshit. It just feels like a lot of bullshit that he is feeding me. I try to be supportive of his fucking career goals but literally how many times have I come in this office and been like he changed his life plan again and now I have to reanimate about being excited or whatever for it. The first step in all of this is you finishing your degree, hello.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: To be honest, I think you're kind of bullshitting both of us.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Okay.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: As you're sitting here talking.</p>

<p>CLIENT: In what regard?</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Well, you sound surprised.</p>

<p>CLIENT: That he is doing this? (chuckles) I am. I'm in denial as usual. I'm in denial that this whole thing, like how could he do this? [00:29:06]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah. I think in the same way that he bullshits you, you bullshit you and me. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Because I wanted to believe that he is not going to do this shit anymore or that he is just going to be able to respect things that I ask and he is just not. Why is the idea of going out to drinks with a girl even at all fucking that you're considering? It doesn't even sound like he thought it was a birthday gathering celebration to begin with. It was straight up, do you want to meet me for a drink? It's my birthday. I already had a celebration but I'd love to catch up. [00:29:53]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: So, I think the bullshitting has a particular purpose, which is I mean sort of fool us into thinking this is the issue and also probably a little bit to pull me into not so much a disagreement with you but more like, sort of like a lecture or a good talking to you as it sounds like maybe your friends give you a little bit. You know, if you put out there for incredulity about how he is behaving or frustration with him, I mean in addition to kind of blowing (ph) up without act that we have both known this about him for quite a long time. It's also I think pulling a little bit for me to step in and be the one who says, well, here he goes again, he is just doing this thing and he always does this and you always fall for it and you just got to get over this, you've got to blahblahblah. [00:31:08] </p>

<p>And then you can kind of leave that point of view with me and keep the one that you had and go home with it (chuckles).</p>

<p>CLIENT: You mean, to be like he is still going to change or-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: No, like either that or so (inaudible at 31:28) why do I keep doing this? This is my problem. I've got to deal with it.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Some combination of that and but I love him and he takes care of me and I don't want to give him up.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Maybe this whole part of the bullshitting is that, I think a little bit like I do want to give him up. [00:31:58]</p>

<p>I think I am almost fighting myself on that one. You know like the devil and the angel scenario. Right. Exactly. One side will be you know you can do so much better, this is not worth your time and effort anymore. You have put enough into this. It is time to move on. You know it is time to move on. And then the other side is well, maybe it's not. Maybe you're never going to find anybody as good. Maybe it will take seven years to find somebody else.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Which side is which?</p>

<p>CLIENT: What do you mean? The angel is the one telling me to move on.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: I just didn't know which one you meant.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah, that's how I imagined it in my mind (crosstalk). Because you know this all adds up to me really feeling like this is enough already. I can't, I have my own emotional issues and issues from my own childhood that I deal with and have to work with. [00:33:00]</p>

<p>I can't be somebody else's emotional whatever, I don't even know, pincushion anymore. And that I really can find somebody that I don't, an issue about cheating or talking to other women whatever the cast may be won't be an issue from the beginning, which it was with Franklin.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: And you can't-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right and I know this. And so I think I am almost, really it's like an internal tug of war of you know that you need to just end this but well maybe you're not ready, it's not time and you to give it more and you need to give him another chance. I feel like I've given him a lot of chances. Some of it is him and he is on the side of the little devil side of me being yeah it's true Trina, like come on. [00:34:01] </p>

<p>And that is a really difficult thing to deal with. You know it's one thing for my friends to be like you just have to sit down and talk to him and make a decision either way and me being oh yeah, I know that's a good idea. And to actually do it and it is just-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I think you pretty genuinely have to be on board.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I don't think it could be, I mean it kind of shouldn't be like somebody else's words and-</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right exactly. Yeah. And so I guess, you know, I have just-but in the meantime I think you're right. I'm bullshitting myself. I'm bullshitting you to a certain extent like-</p>

<p>THERAPIST: That's okay.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right (chuckles) But [it's just okay to him] (ph) with the denial that has always been a big part of this relationship and my viewpoint of his actions or how he should be communicating with me or other people. [00:34:57]</p>

<p>I mean this issue, this thing with telling me that he is going to go out. It was like the kicker today. I was like all right. I have had enough. I can't right now even begin to understand how to respond to you. And then you call me a stalker for asking whose name, like who it is. Are you fucking kidding me? If I were a stalker, then I would have your passwords and be checking your Facebook everyday but I'm not. I just think it's uncomfortable to say, I don't say-if you were to say to me, if the situation were different, it wouldn't be because I wouldn't be going out to drinks with a guy if I were determined on working on my relationship, but you want to hang out. No, I'm going to be out until 11. I'm going out to drinks with my friend Gussie. It wouldn't be, I'm going out to drinks with my friend. That is just, there is no point. You're my boyfriend. You don't know who that friend is when I say her name, I'll tell you. [00:35:58]</p>

<p>Anyway, I just kind of was panicking yesterday and just I guess needing to vent and then today even took it up a notch. It wasn't like anything was better than it was yesterday in terms of our communication today. (pause) </p>

<p>And then him saying, I'm thinking of you less and less is almost like a similar function of well, I just can't do this anymore. It's just, he is saying it to be hurtful and to make me think that I'm doing something wrong. [00:37:01]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I guess some-(pause) There is something like kind of masochistic (ph) in a lot of it, where you, you know compare yourself to the Betty stalking or you know put yourself in a position to be hurt after the hurtful things that he said. [00:38:04]</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. (pause)</p>

<p>THERAPIST: I'm not sure what to make of that. </p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. Me neither. It's definitely not a cycle that I'd like to continue though. I mean on a bigger scale, it is reminiscent of when my mom was drinking at first and I was younger and I would say, well maybe there is something that I can do to change it and I can whatever. I [tell her now that I've always had this relationship] (ph) when it's not it's the other person, they need to change on their own by themselves. There is nothing that I can do about it besides be supportive when the privacy (ph) are being made or whatever. [00:39:00]</p>

<p>(pause) Yeah, I don't know. Now he is talking about going to Mexico. He is I've got an offer to be flown to Mexico by some people who (ph) in a week for three days. I'm like you're going to take a tower (ph) depending on how many stops for a flight for three days. Doesn't really sound like the most well though out plan. It's hard for me to be supportive of those things. (pause) [00:40:01]</p>

<p>She'll think he gets it. She'll think he gets it like the big it, like all encompassing. She'll think he understands. He just doesn't understand. Do you understand that your teeth would be rotting out of your head if it weren't for me? Like more than they were. Do you understand that you wouldn't have even started school if it weren't for me? You wouldn't have passed some of your classes if it weren't for me helping you with homework. And not to sound like an ass but he doesn't, a few of the many things that he just doesn't get. Do you get that I am giving you another chance? [00:40:59]</p>

<p>(pause) Another chance to not do shit that put you in this situation to begin with and you're still doing it. There is no way that I could teach somebody that. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: Okay. No it doesn't matter how much you do. It doesn't matter how many of his bills you pay or even appointments you make or how much you encourage him with school or how much you're supportive of him when he is having a hard time or how many additional chances you give him when he does things that are hurtful to you and that the two of you have talked about. None of those things are going to change how he behaves humping (ph) around.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Right. [00:41:59]</p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 42:00) you'd rather [do that] (ph)</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah. </p>

<p>THERAPIST: (inaudible at 42:17) you often don't sort of act like you know that.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Yeah I know. It's just, like I said, it's exhausting at this point and I'm ready to be in a relationship where I feel taken care of more than I have to take of somebody else and make sure that they're feeling secure. I am ready to be in that sense a more adult relationship where you are busy and you're doing your own thing so that you might not even text me back for 24 hours and it happens. [00:43:03]</p>

<p>(pause) It just feels like there has been a lot of good stuff but at the same time there's been a lot of really painful and difficult stuff throughout this relationship and I think that that is the case in any relationship, you always go through difficult stuff but maybe not so much. I would be willing to find that out, maybe not so much fighting, maybe not messages from girls on your own. [00:44:00]</p>

<p>(pause) You know, I haven't talked to my mother about any of this really at all recently because I can't talk to her about it and I know that her and my father are dying to know what has been going on and what I'm thinking and my father is you know I'm here to talk. But I just can't because I'm already dealing with myself, my inside, my friends, you, all of this, I already have all of this support that I'm reaching for that theirs would just be unfortunately unwelcome, because it would just, there is no, it's really way more bias than anybody could ever be, not so much that they already weren't so enthusiastic.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Right. </p>

<p>CLIENT: I just can't. So that's (inaudible at 44:54) of itself to because I always talk to them about everything. [00:44:59]</p>

<p>Okay, so I will see you Friday.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Yeah, I'll see you on Friday.</p>

<p>CLIENT: Thank you so much.</p>

<p>THERAPIST: Your welcome. </p>
