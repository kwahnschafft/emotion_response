<p>TRANSCRIPT OF AUDIO FILE:</p>

<p>______________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>BEGIN TRANSCRIPT:</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Welcome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, another thing I, um, have for us take a look at today is I know the last time we got together there was a slight adjustment in the Adderall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And I thought we could take a look.  This is an abbreviated form about characteristics of adult ADD.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And, you know, we could look at it together and if there's anything that looks like it rings true or if you've noticed changes over time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  All right, look at the first line.  How often do you have trouble wrapping up the final details of a project once the challenging parts have been done?  At this point with where things stand what would you think?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	After the challenging parts have been done.  I would say sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How often do you have difficulty getting things in order when you have to do a task that requires organization?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Just for clarity, your not talking just about work,in general?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	In general, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Sometimes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  How often do you have problems remembering appointments or obligations?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very often.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.  When you have a task that requires a lot of thought, how often do you avoid or delay getting started?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Often.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Often.  How often do you fidget or squirm with your hands or feet when you have to sit down for a long time?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very often.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Very often.  How often do you feel overly active and compelled to do things like you are driven by a motor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Often.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Well, you are still having some active symptoms.  [INAUDIBLE] always good to look on both sides.  Definitely.  So and this appears to be the case, you know, even with some of the modifications last time around.  Yeah, yeah.  What kinds of things have been, would you say are the most problematic for you?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Amongst those or?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just in general?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Related to ADD or just?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Whatever is foremost on your mind?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  I didn't know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because we're looking at how things stand with the dosing of the Adderall in addition to the other things as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, uh, one thing that has changed from last time is anxiety is still where it has been.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Depression has been markedly declined after starting the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I had three brief episodes since the last visit of depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Where it was very marked [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was very, very despondent.  But it was very brief.  You know, just a couple of hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Which is an improvement over before you were feeling like it was hard to get out of that rut.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, um, I don't know if it's related to the [INAUDIBLE] or not.  Um, I don't see any of the side effects [INAUDIBLE], uh, pharmacy [INAUDIBLE] since starting to take it, but 2 symptoms that are kind of bothersome.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very frequent burning from acid coming up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Tums don't seem to do the trick.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and the other is from the opposite end, passing a lot of gas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  I do know that sometimes people get some GI upset.  Let me take a look in the PDR because that's where I think it's still being released in the branded form which is the dissolvable and we can at least find out how frequently those side effects are reported or if it's thought to possibly be transient.  Is the, um, biggest dose you've been taking a whole 15 mg tablet?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was my other question.  The instructions said, um, originally to cut it in half.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The instructions and insert said not to cut or crush it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So [INAUDIBLE] take the whole thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So from the get go I've been taking the whole thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I wasn't sure whether it was okay to break it or not.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's a solid tablet, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very fragile.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I think they have that warning there because it could, um, shred a little bit, but, um, you know, it's not as significant that it must be 7.5 mg both doses.  But that's probably the, they're probably suggesting it doesn't necessarily make an even cut.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It doesn't have scoring on it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, clearly they're not encouraging you to do so.  Take a look.  They're not putting it in as branded anymore, which is too bad.  Let's see.  I might have it under [INAUDIBLE].  Several companies are making it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I tried finding online, to look it up, I Googled it and it came up under so many different companies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's amazing.  I have one patient who seemed to have a better response to one kind of generic Zoloft than another.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And actually her insurance company, believe it or not, was able to trace back to every pharmacy and figure out which ones had which kind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it turns out there was a certain brand that sat best with her.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I do find that I have to separate it from my morning dose of Klonopin by about an hour and a half.  Otherwise if I take them together.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I can't stay awake.  My eyes get very heavy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I take it when I get to work.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's smart, because I know staying awake while driving has been a concern.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It started being a problem when I was taking them together.  My eyes were very heavy on the way in.  I had to keep shaking my head.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm glad you made that decision to take it at work.  Let's take a look here.  Maybe I have a little more specific information.  Let's see.  Yeah, this one doesn't have a lot of information.  Um, most common side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, fatigue, constipation, increased appetite, sleeplessness, agitation, headache, blurred vision, upset stomach, there you go, decrease in sexual function, nausea, and decreased appetite.  Some may lessen in severity or go away with prolonged use.  So.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not every day, it's frequent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Couple of things we can consider are either trying to divide those tablets, I think it may also come in a liquid.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I know from when I looked online yesterday just to find out if, uh, [INAUDIBLE] pharmaceuticals makes a form that pharmacy [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it showed it as coming in a dissolvable tablet.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I didn't know if.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You did your research.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, it just happened to show up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  I think there might be a liquid as well.  Um, the dissolvable does immediately dissolve and that's helpful for people with swallowing difficulties.  They're almost impossible to divide though, because as soon as you touch them, they start to adhere to your fingers and all that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Even getting it out of the foil is a challenge.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, yeah, yeah.  Do yours currently come in a foil as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but you can't push it through, you have to fold the corner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I hate that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Then.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How aggravating.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've gotten good at it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm sorry you're stuck with that.  Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They come in sheets.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Square.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  So you're taking some in the morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take it at, um, usually about 9:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then again at 4:00 in the afternoon.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I take 10 mg of Adderall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And at like 7:30—ish.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then usually the other one sometime between [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.  How does that seem to be working so far?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, no noticeable difference from where I was before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, okay.  You were on the Adderall XR 20 mg previously.  Now we've broken it down to shorter acting, taking twice a day, and it isn't really making much difference it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Previously yes, that was the capsule that you were taking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.  Oh, that's right, it was a capsule.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it didn't sound as though that was lasting through the day.  Are you still taking Provigil as well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you usually take 1 or 2 a day?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, just 1.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All right.  Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I take that at ten thirty also.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Sounds good.  And it sounds like there's still some issues with feeling sleepy while driving.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, unless I take the, which I actually [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But when I do that there's no problem.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sounds like depression might be [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Although like in the beginning, uh, when I first started taking it in the morning I was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] get used to it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good.  Another thought is we could do dosing at bedtime.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Does it last?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can, yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can, so that could also be an option.  Um, but given how high your score was on the adult self report ADHD scale, uh, I've been doing more research into options for treating ADHD and I don't know if you've been following.  I know you're very interested in the field.  Um, Vyvanse, the first pro drug stimulant.  It's pro drug in the sense that instead of, my understanding is starting metabolism higher up in your digestive tract [INAUDIBLE] so forth.  Um, it actually goes to the small intestine and has to be activated for a slow gradual release through the day.  It lasts 13 to 14 hours.  And people say it's less noticeable when it kicks in and when it shuts off.  Um, the effect measurement in the research are astounding.  Um, and I'd like to [INAUDIBLE] there's a free trial voucher and so forth.  Um, and, you know, we would probably look at a dose that's roughly equivalent to the Adderall XR 20 mg.  And Vyvanse would probably be about 40.  So I'm going to get you some of that information and I think it could be worth a try because I think your metabolism is going through the Adderall [INAUDIBLE] fairly quickly and I think that the metabolism of Vyvanse is going to be just a different approach.  It was approved for adult use at the end of April.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	This was originally designed for child use but it will still give you some of the basic pharmacokinetics.  The reason this is different from other stimulants, um, and I'm just thinking through the day it may be able to give the support you need both to attention and concentration and to the component that goes with feeling depressed.  I mean, if you are starting to feel overwhelmed at work and then you feel like you can't concentrate and, you know, your medication's letting you down and you're tired and draggy all that kind of coalesces to make it a lot more difficult to get done what you need to get done.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And part of that [INAUDIBLE] too is that some of the things that are part of the questionnaire.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was wondering how much is related to anxiety alone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some of the things that have started coming back to [INAUDIBLE] chewing off the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your fingernails.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The nails</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the tops of your skin, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sometimes get out of hand.  Um, my scalp is a mess, it hurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, because you've been doing a lot of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My scalp is covered with this [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're reporting that more now that you are on shorter acting stimulant and sometimes the peaks and valleys of that medication aggravates that.  That may start to improve.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	None of them have healed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Haven't healed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, so like when I brush my hair even just very lightly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It hurts.  Wow.  Nobody would ever know.  You keep your hair so perfect, you know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, the downside it's been probably 8 or 9 months since I had my hair cut.  I do it myself I'm so embarrassed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But still you shouldn't have to, I mean—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm too embarrassed to go because when they wet your hair, well, when I wet my hair it shows right through.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, sure.  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's very apparent.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, everywhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those are large, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You can see them?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I do.  Absolutely.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	For some reason there's something soothing about peeling off the scabs.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think and sometimes it's sort of a control, you know, in the sense that there are lot of amorphous sources of pain in the world and when someone has control of themselves it's kind of a very direct, you know, you're in the driver's seat when that happens.  There's no question.  Um, and it's ironic because it's an irresistible urge, so in a way there's not control over that.  However, it's urging you to do something that is control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because sometimes I know I'm doing it and sometimes I catch myself doing it.  I realized I started to do it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, and it sounds like with the [INAUDIBLE] in the picture it hasn't gotten less.  Um.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But the moods are good.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  This still could have to do with the change from the extended release to the shorter release of the Adderall.  And it may improve overall with the Vyvanse.  I think it could.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm thinking [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  It varies a little bit more lately, doesn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's more constant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I just haven't reported [INAUDIBLE] just because it was kind of like what else is mixed [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm glad you did the questionnaire because it's [INAUDIBLE] to remember to mention.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Because that is part of the whole picture.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, I never stopped doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the frequency has remained level.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, so that hasn't, that hasn't changed.  Uh—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you remember a time when it had more or less abated in your adult life?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've missed it only about maybe a little over a year old.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Prior to that, um, there have been um, pulling the eyebrows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I still do that a little bit.  But this seems to have taken that and I don't know why, but—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How far back do you remember, um, pulling your eyebrows?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, high school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Was there a period of time since high school where you ever remember not feeling that urge at all?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Although oddly enough it's only eyebrows.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah.  Talking about a year ago, let me just see if anything jumps out from the medication adjustments.  The only thing that really jumps out is that right around that time you stopped the Ambien at that time, that was about it.  Yeah, the imipramine that was already, I, the imipramine actually started back around September of '07 as well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One thing I have noticed—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That has resurfaced, very minor compared to what it was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, just checking [INAUDIBLE] here.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There was a time, um, in my soph, my junior year of college [INAUDIBLE] when they had given me Anafranil [INAUDIBLE]  re—emerging that had become dormant.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Since childhood.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  How did that work out, Anafranil?  See, I'm thinking it really hadn't helped very much.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To be honest, it's so long ago now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember any specifics other than, uh, I think they were primarily hoping to use it for depression [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly, yeah.  Yeah, which isn't unusual.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because the obsessive or compulsion [INAUDIBLE] they don't interfere with my life.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But annoying, but it can stop me from doing what I need to do.  I'm going to check the door 3 times to make sure it's locked.  Maybe take a few steps away and then walk back again and check it again, but after the third time I would be able to just go.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and, uh, that was the primary thing, was checking doorknobs and [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Throughout my life I've always had like magical numbers [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Even numbers.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Especially the number 2.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's continued ever, ever since I can remember.  I remember when I was young, I mean, young meaning like [AGE], because everything happened in pairs that included speech.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So when I spoke I didn't repeat out loud, but I repeated it in my head.  Because it had to be said twice.  That died away before, definitely before junior high, and that never resurfaced.  Pairings of things in twos, it still holds some power, but not as much as it did when I was younger.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Did you ever try Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you remember any impact from Zoloft?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember [INAUDIBLE] at all.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's very hard now to differentiate to me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because, um, so many of them were thrown at me over the course of the years.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And clearly we need to custom design something for you in particular.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, there was a time in my early [AGE] that lasted about 3 years or so, um, where I was sexually compulsive.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, which was very disturbing but, you know, I was in treatment anyway at the time and I reported on it and that was a very difficult one to deal with because it was much more danger there than, but that has also gone away.  Um, the compulsiveness [INAUDIBLE] it still comes up and gets channeled elsewhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] masturbation [INAUDIBLE].  Better than—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely, taking unnecessary risks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  Um, but, um, you know, I reported [INAUDIBLE] that, um, maintaining an erection [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I really can't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's very rare.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and if I do, it doesn't last very long.  But I don't know [INAUDIBLE] variables like my cholesterol is higher than it ever was before or I did have the blood work done.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Took a while but [INAUDIBLE] Saturday, couldn't find it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Last weekend on Saturday, um, I tried finding it again.  [INAUDIBLE] sign out, so finally Quest, I went to Lab Corp.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they took the form.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I guess the disadvantage is I guess Quest somehow electronically sends it to [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Whereas Lab Corp either faxes it or mails it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  As long as the results get there.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was on Saturday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good job.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know how long it takes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good job getting it done.  That's excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Your erectile issues most likely are side effects from the medication.  They're just—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I've never had any of the [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was a side effect I never had.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	With Effexor?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Effexor, uh, Anafranil, every single antidepressant I've ever taken, I've never had any.  I've always had a dry mouth which went away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I've never had the sexual problems.  I don't know if maybe things change with age or.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Possibly.  And of course there are 2 antidepressants in place now, the Effexor XR and the imipramine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And now the mirtazapine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's true.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has, is it, can you tell yet if there's a difference with the mirtazapine, is it more so or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, it's not any worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's not any worse.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Ideally, we'd be able to simplify your regimen and be able to minimize any possible contribution of side effects.  Together, you worked with the trial of Wellbutrin, right?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yes.  And the only difficulty there was [INAUDIBLE] dry mouth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was the only downside.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Sometimes dry mouth is an issue with, um, Vyvanse as well.  It often resolves after a few days.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's always been experience with all the other medicines.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It'll go away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because aren't a lot of these medicines [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're supposed to be.  What's interesting about Wellbutrin, out of all the medications that have gone generic, there's by far apparently the biggest variability with Wellbutrin.  Um, and that's been an issue because when people change generics sometimes there can be a 40% potency difference.  So, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's due to quality or?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's weird.  I mean, you're probably aware that as long as a generic is within 20% potency of the brands then it's admissible by the FDA.  Which I think has its pluses and minuses, but if you have 2 generics and one was 20% less potent and the next one is 20% more potent, then the, you know, better control.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's trial and error.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wish there were a way we could get Wellbutrin's effectiveness without the side effect.  But it's kind of take the burden off of you with more frequent daily dosing too.  When Wellbutrin was there before, yeah, a few weeks prior, I think you tried both the XL and the SR form.  Does that sound familiar?  It comes 3 ways, immediate release, immediate release, extended release, and sustained release.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't recall.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  And of course the Effexor has been a mainstay for a long time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Three years was it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Probably, actually longer.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was when I lived in Minnesota.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] 5 years ago.  But it would just be at a lower, uh, dose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah, yeah, back in the day.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Seventy five.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That was the, yeah, that was the immediate release.  Um.  There are a number of possibilities.  Hm.  Anxiety's pretty prominent.  The self, I'll call it self injurious behavior, [INAUDIBLE] mania type behavior, fairly prominent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's been [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the last time we talked about some of those things on my body [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe, I don't know if it's a possibility that I'm touching them unknowingly or in my sleep.  I have no idea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you very itchy?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I'm not very itchy, I just [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't do a lot of scratching.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I perspire like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Has that always been true?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [INAUDIBLE].  I know it sounds funny in a way, but it's hard to like compare them, I'm not a female but if I imagined what a hot flash must feel like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think of it as waves that come over my body [INAUDIBLE] uncomfortable and I've always had those.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Some people get it more with the Effexor.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And nothing has relieved it, it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, I've never really mentioned it before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I first started noticing it towards the latter half of high school.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was almost like someone like turned on a hair dryer [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You have all the advantages of what women and men both experience.  Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's very uncomfortable, but it passes after a couple of minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's an awful feeling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, it's interesting.  Some people experience it with Effexor, other times I know a certain gynecologist who prescribed low doses of Effexor to help treat it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, but I don't have any types of increase [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it definitely way predates because I wasn't taking any medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And it stayed pretty, pretty constant it sounds like.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  It's worse in the summer months.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  And sometimes [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I perspire very, very easily, particularly [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But not anywhere else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're a very strong person to persevere with all that you experience.  For you the physical and the psychological are so closely intertwined.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  [NAME OTHER] has mentioned, he made a comment the other day that over the past, well, he said ever since I started taking that your face looked brighter and you just looked more happy like you don't look downtrodden.  So I took that as a good sign.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and he, I mean, I didn't even ask him.  He just brought it up on his own.  Um, but a little bit more at home a little bit more energy which I didn't recognize [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And certainly less of the despairing lingering in the doldrums.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know, there's still glimpses of the doldrums, but it doesn't drag you down as badly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, I noticed it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but when it does happen it's rather meaningful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, of course.  Yeah, and that—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Especially when it comes out of nowhere.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So it's like you're totally caught off guard.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You're not quite sure how long it's going to last.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It only aggravates challenges with attention and concentration.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How have you been sleeping lately?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's an interesting question because, um, I've noticed some changes.  I still sleep well and everything.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, there's always a but, in the last few weeks I have not been getting a lot of sleep, there are a few night during this work week so I only have 3 to 4 hours of sleep.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And it's not because I can't sleep, in other words, I haven't gone to bed.  I get obsessed with something that I'm doing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And before I know it, it's 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning.  And I have to get up at 6:30 [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what I was working on, and it was enjoyable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, everything is enjoyable, at least ambivalent activity, I was working with the photo software.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] first time I saw it was [INAUDIBLE] 8:30, I should take my medicine.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good thinking.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm supposed to take it at 8:00.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then after 10:00 [INAUDIBLE].  And then I go on and take it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I sit back down again [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I get obsessed with it.  And it's gotten to the point where, you know, I used to feel like, okay, now the overall picture [INAUDIBLE], but now with the software you can like really zoom in and use like fine, um, brush tools to—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's fantastic.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To fix like imperfections and I'm still learning how to use that.  So it's not a frustration, but I, I'm doing way more than needs to be done with the picture.  I just get so engrossed.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In that, that I can't separate.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And this could actually be a feature of the ADD in the sense that when someone finds something that they love to do, everything else goes into the background.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what's interesting about that is I know in the back of my head there's other things that I need to do.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like I need to sleep, I need to let the dog out, I need to eat dinner.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But this is way more fun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's either way more fun or whatever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're just driven with it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.  But it's not like aggravation.  It's not like I have to know [INAUDIBLE] this is something I'm stuck in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You're engrossed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm not going to leave it until I figure it out type of thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you're just engrossed.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And one thing leads to another.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Exactly.  I also have a history of not giving up on things when it might be a good idea.  You know, there was an ultimate walk away from it and come back to it later.  That's not who I am or who have been.  It's always been work at it, work at it, work at it.  Before you know it you're very [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why the SAT's  were not very fun for me.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because they always say, you know, if you get stuck on a problem, move on to the next one and I would chew up my time thinking, you know—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm going to take this thing out.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm going to turn on my big [INAUDIBLE].  Some of the brightest people just might not do well on that type of test.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And it's interesting because I can average on the SAT.  I hit the ball out of the park or in that placement test [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] European history, American history, I got 5s on them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Phenomenal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So anything that was written.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was true in college.  I don't mind exams with multiple choice because of what I majored in.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I majored in history, you have to write essays.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you're very good at that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Multiple choice though, I don't like.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And the thing is often there could be ambiguity with multiple choice.  Well, it could be.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, and that's where, one test that I just developed [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And there a lot of the complaints are logic games.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, so and so will sit next to so and so but he can't sit next to so and so and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, those are crazy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they're all like logic games.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I, I get so frustrated [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because they're really tough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What it brings to my head is that when I went for the neuropsych testing and I couldn't, stupid blocks [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I remember [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I thought [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I was so upset about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's happened twice, I don't know if that's like anything to worry about [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think it has to do with the new Adderall dosing not meeting your needs.  I actually think you are a fast metabolizer even with the XR.  And spreading out the dose is not covering it.  Maybe it's lasting you an hour, and then it's not there.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Could my diet have anything to do with anything?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How much caffeine do you consume?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very, well, what I have every day is I go to work, I usually have in the car a cup of tea.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, that's reasonable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't, sometimes coffee, but I don't like coffee that much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's just as well especially with your upset stomach.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So just once a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, not every day but usually one can of soda.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  That's not bad.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that's it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Chocolate, ice cream?  Ice cream used to be a big one for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't bought it in [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	We do have now, um, low fat [INAUDIBLE] like the sandwiches.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.  Those are good.  And the Weight Watchers fudge popsicles are phenomenal.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, that's it.  I mean, uh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So you're not really, you don't have much caffeine intake.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The one thing that happened different this week I bought, I was in Sam's Club and it caught my eye and I bought it because I love, I bought one of those big bags of Tootsie Rolls.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I have been downing them like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, you're getting some sugar high from that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was on Sunday.  I still have a bag, so I've been eating like, like there's 750 in a bag.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Those are hard to resist.  Oh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think in the time since Sunday I've eat half a bag.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are you eating them late at night when you're working on the computer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's fueling you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's like—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, that's helping keep you awake, keep doing the thing that you're compelled to do.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, giving you that fuel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That is one thing that, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But otherwise most of what I eat is grain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, which is good.  With your cholesterol, grain definitely, whole grain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Depends on the grain.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, whole grain is good, you know, with your cholesterol situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And at lunch I always have you know those drinkable yogurts.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I always have that.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Overall [INAUDIBLE] healthy eating.  The occasional Tootsie Roll binge.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  I don't get any vegetables, zero.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Are there any that you like?  How can you work them in?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like fruit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, well, fruit's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, but vegetables I just find it difficult to figure out a way to incorporate them into my day.  I don't like raw carrots, I like cooked carrots, but not raw carrots.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Celery sticks and humus?  Um, cucumbers?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is there nutritional value in cucumbers?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What's that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is there any nutritional value in cucumbers?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I'm thinking more of the fiber.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] nutritional values.  Spinach would be great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I mean, I like cooked spinach.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So like the vegetables that I like I like them cooked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If you [INAUDIBLE] can you walk in and cook veggies there?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, like especially when [NAME OTHER] big on veggies.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He likes veggies, he doesn't like fruit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Aha, there you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] liking fruit.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, you two need to inspire each other here.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So like there has been twice where I found Trader Joes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[DEIDENTIFIED] has great prepared vegetables.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've always bought, the last couple weeks I've been buying [INAUDIBLE] bok choy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I love bok choy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] good for you.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'll steam it in a steamer.  It just sits there in the refrigerator and turns a nice shade of whatever it turns, you know, when it's past due.  But I buy it with the intention.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] bok choy.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  Did you steam it and it turned out well?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had to call my mom, like mom how do you make this?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You might be able to get away with putting it in a shallow microwave dish with a little water for a couple minutes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what she said.  Remove the heart and—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, as long as it's quick.  Because I know that extra preparation step, you know, that's what gets you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  But it was easy.  I mean.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  And I love it, did you put some soy sauce on it and stuff?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like it just—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I like broccoli.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	As long as it's cooked.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I don't care for raw broccoli either.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Cauliflower I can eat if, if,—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cheese.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I always use [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like cheddar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's good.  You have some good veggie ideas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What I had done at one point in time [INAUDIBLE] not good from the sodium content but I try to make up for [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You drink low sodium V8?  Even better, yeah, that's even better.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, you know, I know it's still processed foods and I don't know if—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, no, V8's great for you.  Every dietician will say.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yep.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's relatively less processed than lots of other things, especially the low sodium V8.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  When I worked at [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and I bought a [INAUDIBLE] and I like it.  [INAUDIBLE] carrot juice with other juice in it but it's predominantly carrot juice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good choice.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So I'm trying to figure out ways to get where I'm not getting some vegetables.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Doesn't matter what [NAME OTHER] if you like it go for it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I also started taking some kind of [INAUDIBLE] takes these little [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, fish oil, yes.  Omega 3, yeah, good, it's good for your cholesterol too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, is it?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It can have positive benefits for cholesterol and mood.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why I started taking it because I had read something that says that, um, it was [NAME OTHER]'s cousin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	She said you might want to try salmon or [INAUDIBLE] and so forth.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Now here's something I need to let you know about the fish oil.  Um, my personal experience with it is it causes a lot of GI upset for me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So that's interesting.  So you might want to investigate some time away from that or maybe.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, because it does kind of coincide.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, they do have some enteric coated types.  I was very disappointed.  I couldn't tolerate it because I really wanted to like it and I wanted it to like me.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, when I think about it.  Because that's when I started to get [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Lots of stomach upset and gas.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  I take it every day in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's got to be it.  That's the only thing, about 2 or 3 weeks.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, because I don't usually hear about the imipramine what you were saying.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's got to be it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sometimes I hear a little nausea but not as much about the specific.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So have salmon instead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Have salmon a couple times a week.  [DEIDENTIFIED], I love [DEIDENTIFIED].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They have these wonderful pre—marinated fish.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's already marinated, you just stick it under the broiler for 2 minutes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And they also told us [INAUDIBLE] salmon in the—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  You'll love it.  [NAME OTHER] will love it.  And there's a very good chance it's that supplement that's been giving you the hard time.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I've also lately I don't know if [INAUDIBLE] salmon, but sometimes [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good, yes, that's an excellent source of calcium and a lot of other things, so.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I'm afraid it might be.  Yeah.  But you know, there are lots of other ways of getting excellent omega 3.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And there are all different preparations for omega 3.  Some more enteric coated than others.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Maybe I should try something else.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh and I eat almonds.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, unsalted, raw.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good.  You have all the right instincts.  Just [INAUDIBLE] fine tuning a little bit, try to go for low sodium V8, stay with the unsalted nuts as much as you can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So great value in V8 then?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I would drink it—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Nutritionists love the low sodium particularly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I would drink it and I'm thinking, oh, I hope it does some godd because I'm not going to eat vegetables.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.  Any nutritionist worth their salt, if you'll pardon the expression, will say if you aren't getting sufficient vegetable servings, get yourself some low sodium V8.  At least a couple glasses a day, you're going to be moving ahead.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Maybe I should.  But I was trying to think about, it sounds silly, but I was trying to think about could a component of difficulties with memory and concentration come from diet, you know, having—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It certainly can.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Certain things, um, and I thought, well, you know, I'm not getting any vegetables.  Maybe my brain wants something that you find in vegetables versus predominantly which what I eat is dairy and grain.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  And that should be in your diet and you just need to balance it out with vegetables.  But also based on how things turned out with that, um, questionnaire, I'm not treating your ADD well enough.  I truly believe that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's where I get frustrated.  Almost like [INAUDIBLE] standing in the way.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They are very much intertwined.  And even with the staying up late, you know working on the computer, some people would say, oh, that sounds manic.  That sounds like OCD.  ADD also drives that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It is a trait that I have [INAUDIBLE] my family chalks it up to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But both of us tend to fixate on things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  Uh-huh.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Either a test or something, orwe'll fixate on a thought mentally.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I see it in me [INAUDIBLE] what it was.  But there are many, many, many times when I was growing up [INAUDIBLE] where my mom will be doing something like, uh, balancing the checkbook or reading or something like her knitting directions or something, and you will say something to her.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No acknowledgement whatsoever.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] said something.  And say her name louder, louder, louder and she'll just get irritated.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, you know, [INAUDIBLE] I do the same thing [INAUDIBLE] she does.  Her reaction, her silencing of the world is more noticeable than my [INAUDIBLE].  I see it in myself.  She and I are very similar like that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm similar to my father when it comes to anxiety.  Yeah, I mean, but she tunes out the world.  Not [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Right.  That can go with the attentional issues.  Yeah.  And you can see where, um, evolutionarily it has it's adaptive spot and, you know, then the question is does the person who's experiencing it find it humorous?  Probably not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I think I'm starting to drive [NAME OTHER] a little crazy too because, um, there's this show that I've started watching.  Um, it's on National Geographic Channel, it's called Locked Up Abroad.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Really?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] end up in prison overseas.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That sounds like a great show.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The only problem is [INAUDIBLE] country is always different, but the reason's always the same.  They were [INAUDIBLE] rules for smuggling [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Cautionary tale.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Last night it was Bangladesh.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh boy, oh boy.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and after they come back from every commercial on the screen they summarize in writing, um, like a paragraph or two of what's happened so far.  And, um, you know, we've got a TiVO so we go backwards in time even with live tv, I have to keep going back, I can't read it fast enough before it disappears from the screen.  And that aggravates him too like it'll come on slowly like [INAUDIBLE] and I can't read it fast enough before it disappears on the screen, I get aggravated by that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And what time is it that you're watching that program?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, any time of the day because usually it's recorded.  It's on the TiVO and I—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So even if it's a time when some of the Adderall's in your system it's not sufficient.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That's pretty clear.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Usually I'm watching it with [NAME OTHER], I never watch it when I'm alone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.  You are a very unique and fascinating individual.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's why I tend to avoid, um, movies with subtitles [INAUDIBLE] I can't read it fast enough before it disappears.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh-huh.  Well, this is fixable.  We're just going to keep working at it until we find the ideal combination for you.  The one that gives the most relief with the minimum of side effects.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Some, and again it's not looking for a quick fixer—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because there is no such thing.  We had [INAUDIBLE] at what point do we come to a juncture.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In the road where something like [INAUDIBLE] thought about but that may be for depression.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	No, no, it's not necessarily only for depression.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	How do you know when you're starting to approach, I mean, as a clinician how do you know when you're starting to approach the point where, hmm?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's a good question.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because it sounds like there's still a lot of options pharmacologically.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  Definitely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and I'm sure as time goes on [INAUDIBLE], how do you know when to say, you know what, let's take this exit and if that doesn't work get back on the freeway?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, exactly.  Let me tell you the pros and cons that I would think about in your situation with ECT.  ECT is mostly studied with mood disorders, severe depressions, and even bipolar, so where somebody tends to really sink into a deep melancholic type depression and, um, medications don't provide relief, sometimes when a person has tried a number of medications and they have seemed to stop working, ECT can help almost like reset the thermostat in terms of helping to relieve some of that deep despair, and sometimes people will find a renewed response to medication.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	To medicines, right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That's what I was thinking about.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  The more that you and I work together the more I'm thinking you may be having some very individualistic symptoms of the attention deficit disorder that really has taken a backseat to, you know, issues with anxiety, despair, and yet the ADD is a common thread and it's simply been under treated or your metabolism has been going through the medication so quickly.  That could have a lot to do with the memory and the attention issues and the concentration.  The major side effect of ECT, as you're probably aware, is memory loss.  Short term memory loss.  It returns to varying degrees in various people.  Usually it's short term memory, you know, the events in the week or so prior to the treatments.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Often many, much of the memory does return, so it shouldn't be a total deterrent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[NAME OTHER]'s cousin also said [INAUDIBLE]</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.  Exactly.  Um, and that's where I'm thinking until you and I both feel like, well, we really haven't left nay stoned unturned with the ADD, I would say let's keep the ECT as a possibility.  Um, but it just may be that some of the issues could be addressed and it's just recently that the prevalence of adult ADD is really being acknowledged.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the question that I have, actually there are two questions that I have.  [INAUDIBLE].  I guess where I get stuck with the ADD, like the concept of it is growing up up through into college I had no problems at school with attention at all.  So it's hard to reconcile how can I have it now and not have it as a child?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You may have had a less typical presentation.  Like I'm thinking about—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was a very compliant child in the classroom.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never made a disturbance.  Sat in my seat.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Paid attention to the instructor.  No behavioral problems.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hyperactivity was not an issue.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, not at all.  And my grades were As, predominantly As, the occasional B plus.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  I'm thinking about the SAT experience that you described where, um, the focus is so intense that it's hard to go back and have a macro view, you know what I mean?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	The pieces, you wanted to understand those pieces so thoroughly that you're looking at the trees but not the forest.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And that happened in the neuropsych test too.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There was a portion on that.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I remember getting very annoyed and upset at the same time because one of the questions, or one of the problems [INAUDIBLE] was, um, adding, um, like one and one quarter plus three and four fifths or something like that.  I'm like, oh my gosh, I remember doing this in fourth grade.  I know how to start, I don't know what to do next.  And I [INAUDIBLE].  I remember having to find the lowest common denominator, blah, blah, blah.  [INAUDIBLE].  And I wouldn't go on to the next thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I ran out of time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Given sufficient time and less stress you could solve that no problem.  Just as given sufficient time you could read everything that's on the screen, but if you know it's there just for a short period of time you're trying so hard to direct your focus that the forest is lost for the trees.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.  And the, a little bit of like [INAUDIBLE] little bit of like a racing feeling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, you start to feel panicked.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Panicked or revved.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I remember one time [INAUDIBLE] I really felt overly excited, you know, like [INAUDIBLE] I think [INAUDIBLE] mania or.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	A manic episode?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  And my response was, you know, the way [INAUDIBLE] like when you go out on a spending spree or, but whenever it happens it always happens in private, um, [INAUDIBLE] sometimes in extreme [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What feels like euphoria, um, where I'll get very silly, uh, um, [INAUDIBLE] but like I'll be saying silly things, um.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Talking to yourself?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Talking to myself or to the dog.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like making plans and things like that?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Things like that or talking nonsense like nonsense speak.  Um, in a very excitable tone.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	When was the last time that happened?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Was it one of the nights you were up late with the computer?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No, it was, um, at home, but during like twilight, but [NAME OTHER] was away, he was away the whole week.  He came home yesterday.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and so it was there as a child, it was, it's never gone away.  Um, uh, but no one's ever witnessed it.  It won't happen if there's other people around.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's not that I try not to do it when there's other people around.  It's just something stops me from doing it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't know what.  But it's like becoming very giddy feeling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I love it when it happens.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, it sounds like fun.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's a total [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, when you need it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's such a, like I said, it does feel like euphoria but I have never taken [INAUDIBLE] illegal drugs [INAUDIBLE].  But when you hear about what those experiences are like when they're quote, unquote high, um, I would probably bet that it's a very similar feeling.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Is there a feeling of well being that goes with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you have sort of a feeling of well being with it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Like, ah, I wish I could make this last?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I haven't thought about that, but it's a definite feeling of every things wonderful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Like sometimes, you know, I'll jump up and down, this is very embarrasing, jump up and down or, or, you know, I'll jump up and down [INAUDIBLE] like actionable [INAUDIBLE] sometimes.  And when I feel that way also sometimes I'll have music on and I will play the same song over and over and over and over and over [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any particular song?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That you turn to?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	No.  It's usually something fast paced.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But not always.  It's never anything like somber or slow.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's either normal or fast.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Classical or modern or?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Never [INAUDIBLE] something like that.  Not classical.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What are some examples of what you would choose?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Uh, the last time it happened was yesterday, um, Phil Collins [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	When I say play it over and over again, like 2 times.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't even listen to the radio in the car.  I have the same 8 CDs that I listen to over and over and over and over and over.  I just never change them.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, which one?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	They're mixes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That I made myself.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, that's excellent.  Then you get a huge variety with that.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's at the point where, I mean, some of the same songs are on some of the same CDs where I know now what song's coming next.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And so the same song [INAUDIBLE] based on the one before it.  [INAUDIBLE] over and over again.  Not because I think anything bad will happen if I don't.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just it's more being a creature of habit, but.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] and [NAME OTHER] the exact same lunch every day.  I think what, and there is a world of overwhelming choices out there.  You just have to pick some things to stick with, you know, to do, you know, either some structure of some familiarity or some comfort.  You know?  All over the world people meditate and say the same thing over and over.  It could be the rosary, it could be a chant.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Right.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But it's just dramatically, when it does happen—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's such a dram, just it's the exact opposite of the summit [INAUDIBLE] it's like, it's not just [INAUDIBLE].  It's ecstatic I would say.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You could be looking at a bipolar situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Very short lived.  Very short lived.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And what I mean by short lived is it could be 20 minutes.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then it's gone, it just vanishes, just like sometimes the depressions—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Vanish.  [INAUDIBLE] leave me drained afterwards or [INAUDIBLE].  [INAUDIBLE] a little bit of a baseline.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It's just, I never thought about it before.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well, I'm very glad you, it came to mind.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  What was your experience with the lithium?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, [INAUDIBLE] very long.  It was right after I got out of the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I wasn't on it, I was only on it for maximum 3 weeks.  And 2 out of the 3 weeks that I was on it I was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was my [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good for you.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The family that I lived with [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So great.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember anything about it.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was only 3 weeks.  Um, this particular doctor, I had been [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, yes.  And we know a lot more about lithium now too then we did back then.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The hard part is I don't think he practices anymore so I basically, um, [INAUDIBLE] when I tried to see if I could get my medical records because so many [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I saw him outpatient.  He was the doctor that was assigned to me at the hospital.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Um, it's [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And, uh, uh, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] at one point is about 2 years ago I was thinking of trying to contact him when I was asked by [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE] so many of them were [INAUDIBLE] that having that list or report would be helpful.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Right.  Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I was never able to actually track him down [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Well, I might be able to work on tracking him down especially since that was, you know, local.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And [INAUDIBLE] where I live now.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.  Wow.  Interesting.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, yeah, under his care was where I had the most different types of medicine.  And then a few more when I moved to Massechusett's valproic acid.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	What do you remember about the valproic acid?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Meaning I don't remember anything.  Nothing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And now we just have so many more options for treating bipolar.  It's remarkable.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, I do remember [INAUDIBLE] atenolol for panic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was more recent.  That was when [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.  All of these things are very helpful to recall.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, and the same doctor that gave me atenolol, his name's [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He did wonders for me in terms of kind of forcing me to [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, [INAUDIBLE] family dynamic.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He basically more or less forced me to grow up.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] part of the problem was I was too attached to my family, to my father found it very easily to follow the direction [INAUDIBLE] if you have a problem don't pick up the phone and call us [INAUDIBLE].  My mom had a harder time.  She was oftentimes noncompliant with [INAUDIBLE].  And she also [INAUDIBLE] my family.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	How did he get through to you?  What did he say?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Honestly, basically the point that [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Who was the one who—</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Who's the doctor who said to you you can't possibly have felt that much panic for that long?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That was, that was a doctor in the same practice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Wow, in [DEIDENTIFIED]?  Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I remember, um, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] was his name.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Hm, I would have wanted to read him the riot act.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had just graduated from college and he told me that he was the one, more or less if I hadn't gone to the hospital in [DEIDENTIFIED] [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I had a choice.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I could either go to the one that he wanted me to go to in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, or if I refused I would have to because this was right after [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, but, um, I remember not liking him very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was probably in his late [AGE] early [AGE], probably mid [AGE], some South Africa [INAUDIBLE] accent.  And he always used foul language.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's totally inappropriate.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Made me very uncomfortable.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Of course.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He was the one that said it's impossible to be that aroused for that long.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Thank you Mr.  Expert.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] physiologically impossible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Well.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because I was telling him that these anxiety feelings just last 4, 5, 6 hours.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They did.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And he said it's not possible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You know what you felt, you're the expert on what you felt.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that's when [INAUDIBLE] graduate school my father had finished being treated, more or less, he was just going twice a year for, uh, medication  maintenance, and, you know, we talked through [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Exactly.  You've come a long way.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Um, but it's interesting I never even thought about mentioning the other side of the coin.  It doesn't happen as often now unfortunately.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, yeah, that tends to be the case.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I don't have problems with things like [INAUDIBLE] it's gotten much, much better over time.  I used to agonize over spending money, buying something that wasn't 100% necessary.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um-hum.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And even then I was [INAUDIBLE].  In graduate school the apartment was freezing, um, [INAUDIBLE].  And it's not because I couldn't [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, the control [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was [INAUDIBLE] actually.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was a fear thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I was afraid of running out of money.  When I got my first job out of graduate school I was saving, saving, saving, and saving, and saving.  And [INAUDIBLE] splurge a little bit.  And I kind of got more comfortable with it.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	You should have fun, travel.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Don't you want to live [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's right, exactly.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So that was going well, I was saving only the max my 401K that you're allowed, but I was still holding on to everything.  Obviously now it's gotten much better with all the trips I go on.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.  And absolutely why not.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every once in a while I will buy something and have that feeling of, oh boy, I should have never, ever, ever have done that.  And I'll obsess over it.  Um, but then I kind of trigger back to something that, uh, [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER] said once which [INAUDIBLE] how much was the shirt?  I said, like $40.  And he said the brand [INAUDIBLE] retirement age that $40 from that number of years ago [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Good point.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I told him no.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There you go.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But I would literally, the world would stop.  And even when I was in the store, [INAUDIBLE] back then it didn't, agonizing over whether to buy the stupid thing.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Every once in a while [INAUDIBLE] very, very infrequent now.  I think I've somehow just gotten over that fear about money.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	It's not at all uncommon for bipolar and ADD to live together too.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The other thing that, um, that I wanted to mention, and this is [PHYSICIAN NAME OTHER].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Unfortunately, I can't remember whether it worked or not, there was a problem at one point, I don't remember what medicine it was, with sexual side effects [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] BuSpar.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	He said he's had patients where that somehow countered.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I don't remember anything about it unfortunately.  Doctor in Minnesota, luckily it was only a brief period of time because [INAUDIBLE] problem went away.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] excellent.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, so it was [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	There was a 3 week period, um, where, um, it was probably Viagra and [INAUDIBLE] anymore.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Fair enough.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  That can be helpful, BuSpar can help.  Wellbutrin.  So if that remains in the picture, absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] BuSpar [INAUDIBLE]?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Definitely.  And interestingly just earlier I was meeting with, um [INAUDIBLE].  It can.  Everybody's unique.  So, you know, I've seen situations where it's exactly [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	But, um, in veterinary medicine it's used with cats with urinary control problems.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Oh, really?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	So it's kind of [INAUDIBLE] physiology somehow.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Well, my dog takes Prozac.  It's a lot cheaper than human Prozac.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's interesting isn't it?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	My dog also takes Klonopin.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Klonopin, no kidding.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But, um—</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're mammals too, there's no reason things shouldn't work with them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	The veterinarian said that ideally he would be getting 2 doses a day because apparently they metabolize it much, much faster than humans.  It takes it in the morning 6 mg.  And [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Just goes to show him [INAUDIBLE] very different.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	There are some people whose either panic or seizure disorder is so severe that they might take that.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	In 2000, um, I was taking 5 mg a day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Not all in one dose.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  And that's not unheard of.  With a case of panic like yours, if that's what it takes.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	It was the only way that I could get through the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Absolutely.  And I'm not opposed to that.  If that day ever returns we'll be right on top of it.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Luckily it hasn't.  But it was a very stressful time.  I'd just moved to Massachusetts and got my very first job out of graduate school.  Felt like I didn't understand anything and they made a mistake by hiring me.  All those things.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Takes a while to find your sea legs so to speak.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.  Well [INAUDIBLE] first arrived at college.  I made a phone call home [INAUDIBLE] telling my parents [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Ah, many, many students have felt that way.  So let's try to zero in with better control on the ADD.  Give the Vyvanse a try.  You know, similar molecule to the Adderall but different metabolism.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, we'll get together again in a few weeks.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, look at what's been happening, you know, maybe look at the mood issues and where things stand because currently we have quite a few things impacting on the mood.  When you've got, um, the fish oil out of the picture for a couple days, you know, see where things go with the GI situation.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm glad you mentioned that.  [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, I was so disappointed I wanted to like fish oil so much.  You know, I wanted to feel like [INAUDIBLE] never did.  So it was a miserable gastrointestinal feeling.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, just miserable.  But there are different preparations and frankly eating more fish was a joy.  So yeah.  Um, so I'm going to give you the Vyvanse prescriptions and then there's a, um, a discount card I think you call up and activate before you take it in.  And so that gets you a free trial.  And let's figure out a good date for a followup appointment.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Is there a certain time [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Usually in the morning.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And with the [INAUDIBLE] certainly, you know, it sounds like the way you're dosing actually is fine.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] mentioned to me, and I didn't do it [INAUDIBLE] exactly, um, he said that I might experiment with reducing the amount of [INAUDIBLE] that I take at that time.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Especially if you take the Remeron.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, right now I'm taking Remeron at 9:00 in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	One at 4:00 PM.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then my nightly dose of Klonopin at 8:00 PM, which is 1 mg.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And then I've got the 0.5 mg in the morning.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, should I try taking 0.5 at night or should I try taking Remeron at bedtime now?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's see, why don't you have the one change you make be taking that afternoon Remeron at bedtime?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay so at 8:00 PM?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, so you almost have it spread out more like every 12 hours.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	If what we're going to do is keep a steady level.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And then, you know, next time we'll see how you're doing with sleep and, you know, daytime concentration and, yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.  Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	I think that would be a good thing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And I haven't had to take Xanax.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	That's amazing.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Well, they're kind of there as a backup.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	They're like Alice in Wonderland [INAUDIBLE].  You know, just there, not have to use them.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Although [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.  I'm sure about that.  Now what time of day tends to be good?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	You know, um, one good thing about my job is I have a lot of flexibility.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] a lot of [INAUDIBLE] work from home.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, good.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Because a lot of my [INAUDIBLE] are just teleconferences.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, like today.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Excellent.  And that's a huge plus.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	So, um, I am very flexible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Do you prefer morning?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Um, ideally either the earlier in the day or the later in the day.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But if nothing's available like, you know, I'm very flexible in terms of [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Any times around 10:00 AM, okay, or 10:30?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, would you rather do eleven on [DATE] or 10:30 on [DATE]?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	What was the first one?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Eleven on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	And the other?</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Uh, then we have 10:30 on [DATE].  Um, I might be able to do a 9:30 on [DATE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, mostly Tuesdays in September.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].  Um, [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Um, let's see, about a month.  Today's the [DATE], so [DATE] would be about a month from now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE] possible.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	I'm just a little bit leery sometimes like [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Sure, okay.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But maybe [INAUDIBLE] I don't know.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Let's have it there, [DATE] 9:30 and then, you know, something comes up and you want to move it back a week or two that's fine.  But at least, you know, we'll have that in place.  Yeah.  Not a problem at all.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Luckily nothing's ever happened where it [INAUDIBLE] pretty much coming back on track [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	And you can always call me.  There's nothing to say you have to postpone everything until then also.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Okay.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah, okay, that sounds good.  So would you like me to put that on a card?</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	That'd be great.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	All right.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.  Yeah, it's very interesting.  If you look online there's a lot of good information as well.  I think it's extremely promising.  I really do.  I attended a conference recently and I was very impressed with the results.  So, yeah.  Okay, great.  All right.  Well, I will see you in [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thank you very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See you in September as the old song.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yeah.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	[INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Oh, I know.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	But at least [INAUDIBLE].</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Yes, yes, that helps.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Thanks very much.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	Okay, good to see you.  Take care now.</p>

<p><b>PT:</b>	Take care.</p>

<p><b>DR:</b>	See you next time.</p>
